"The Dark Knight","Smells_Like_Cheese","20 July 2008","I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night, the reason though why I'm writing this movie comment this late is because I didn't wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, I wanted to think it through, still today, I can't stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to it's hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman's skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson's performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like ""What are they, kidding?"", once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! I'm not going to compare Jack and Heath's performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heath's Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didn't know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he's crazy, he's driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, who's previous film, Batman Begins, didn't really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it's not real, people don't dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don't name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, he's inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and he's going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham's mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the ""Classy Villain that Gotham needs"", he also has brought a new thought into Batman's head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gotham's ""White Knight"" trying to put all of Gotham's scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone's going crazy over Heath Ledger's performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heath's and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I don't wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I can't come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. I've seen it twice in one weekend, I'm going to see it three times this upcoming week, I don't mind one bit. I can't wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker.10/10","

"The Dark Knight","littlemartinarocena","24 July 2008","Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!","

"The Dark Knight","kosmasp","14 September 2008","I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan ""Biggest screen in the UK""), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!","

"The Dark Knight","filmquestint","20 July 2008","I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want.","

"The Dark Knight","melwinbauer","22 November 2021","I think that I could wax lyrical but this movie all day. It is absolutely incredible from start to finish.This is the Batman trilogy's second outing. It's filled with hard-hitting action and almost every scene is absolutely enthralling to watch. The story is really good. The twists and turns keep the viewer constantly on their toes, especially in the third act of the movie. There are so many memorable scenes packed throughout this movie, so many quotes and ideas sprinkled throughout that you probably could analyze it for hours.Because while the action and story is incredible, it is the dynamic between the Batman and the Joker that really makes this movie what it is. It is all in the contrast between the two. Right against wrong. Chaos and anarchy versus order. The Joker is the perfect villain for Batman. Batman is literally, as said in the movie, a symbol. The very essence of the idea of the Batman is centered around order, rules and moral codes. He is the embodyment of what is right. The Joker challenges the very core and foundation of who Batman is and what he stands for. He is someone who doesn't follow any rules. He is pure chaos and anarchy personified. As he so perfectly states in the third act of the movie, while hanging upside down off of a building: ""this is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object"". The Joker wants the Batman to go against his morals and to break his rules. The powerful thing is also that you can see why the Joker does what he does. In some ways he has a point and that also adds another layer to the character and to the dynamic between the two. It is truly an amazing battle. The brilliant acting from Heath Ledger is a major part of it too. He is absolutely incredible as the Joker. Rest in peace.I could probably go on further about how great I think this movie is but I'll just say this. Just watch the movie. You should watch the first movie of the trilogy first but if that is something you absolutely don't wan't to do I still think you should see this movie. It is just great.","

"The Dark Knight","AlsExGal","2 October 2017","Although I don't think it is the fourth best movie ever made, as it is rated according to IMDb, I do think it stands head and shoulders above its super-hero peers, mainly because it is NOT a superhero movie. Batman is a mere mortal with lots of time to train himself physically and money to design the nifty gadgets he uses.Everybody on earth has seen this film, so no use regurgitating the plot. I think Heath Ledger's rendition of The Joker is a masterpiece. Every time he leaves the screen I keep waiting for him to come back. Ledger should have won the best actor Oscar rather than supporting actor, because this is really a two leading man film - Bale as Batman and Ledger as The Joker. I always liked Jack Nicholson's rendition of the Joker in the 1989 film directed by Tim Burton, but Ledger just blows Nicholson's performance away. Maybe it is because Nicholson's Joker had a past and an explanation for his behavior, maybe it is because, after all, Nicholson's Joker just seems to be the wild side of the real Jack Nicholson where Heath Ledger never steps out of character for the entire film. Ledger's Joker is like the devil decides to become incarnate, but unlike Ray Milland's devil in ""Alias Nick Beal"" shows his true self - somebody who wants to break the spirits of people, to turn them on one another, to wantonly destroy property, people, whatever. That's reinforced when the police can find no name, no past, no prints, no DNA, not even a label in his clothes when they arrest him. His past is a great big question mark. I like Michael Caine's Alfred - it's good to have someone with relevant past combat and guerrilla experience be a wise father figure to Wayne in this role rather than just a kindly museum piece. Likewise, Morgan Freeman is pitch perfect as Lucius and Wayne's version of Q - somebody who invents his gadgets and runs his business since this really is not where Wayne's mind is, Freeman gives the performance the perfect balance of humor, business acumen, and conscience. And finally I like the fact that Rachel, Bruce Wayne's love interest, is not played by someone who is some unrealistic 10.5/10. She's a cute girl, but her attributes lie in her mind and her heart as well.The negatives - I think Harvey's transformation into Two Face is a little too pat. I don't know why Batman has a totally different voice from Bruce Wayne. Is he doing that on purpose? And I think I found one editing error. Gordon in the end talks about how hard it will be to cover up Harvey/ Two Face's murders including ""two cops"". Harvey let crooked cop Ramirez live and just knocked her out. But if she had lived then Gordon and Batman's plan to cover up Harvey's crimes would never have worked because she would have known what happened. So which scene was wrongly included/scripted? I'd recommend it as one of the better films made since the turn of the century that was also a blockbuster.","

"The Dark Knight","johnnymacbest","7 July 2008","Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all  of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael  Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly  enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack  Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal  and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress""  stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in  films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around  more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins""  in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The  action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud  Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who  sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing  in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may  feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I  will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor  him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a  human being and father to his daughter Matilda  Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his  daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this  role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented  actor.  Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008.","

"The Dark Knight","LoneWolfAndCub","16 July 2008","I think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: Is Christopher Nolan's follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film ""Batman Begins,"" The Dark Knight, as good as everyone is saying? Quite simply, yes, yes it is. There is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as action orientated as you might expect.I will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. However, a basic one sentence summary is: Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...The Joker. Now that that is out of the way, I will start off with the actors (and boy, is there a lot to talk about). Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader, with him already blowing everyone else out of water with ""Batman Begins."" Bruce Wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift, whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. Because of this, and Bale's tremendous acting, Bruce Wayne is justified, and we emphasise with Bale's flawed hero more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an excellent Batman, this is it. The theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here.Of course, I am sure you all want know if Heath Ledger was that good. And I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledger's Joker is not only the best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant; any synonyms of the previous adjectives. Every scene he is in is stolen. The Joker truly is Batman's worst villain; cunning and psychotic, nothing quite matches his laugh and sinister makeup. If Ledger nabs the Oscar for Best Actor, I honestly will not be surprised. It is a true tragedy to see such a talented actor fall at such a young age...All the other actors cannot be forgotten, though. Aaron Eckhart has definitely proved himself previously (""Thankyou for Smoking"") as someone to watch out for. Here, as Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he is very powerful. All he wants is justice; to bring down every single criminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Wayne and Dent's love interest, Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie Holmes. Gyllenhaal's performance has substance, I really cared for her and her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can do no wrong, and as Alfred Pennyworth he provides some comical and emotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, although a limited role, does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the story. Finally, Gary Oldman's Lt. James Gordon is riveting. He at least needs a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another crime-fighting hero who faces some challenging situations.Wally Pfister's cinematography is simply stunning. Gotham has never looked so good, so big and deep. His wide shots purvey a dirty aura and contribute to the feel of the film. Without it, it may not have been the same. Another Oscar worthy portion, THE MUSIC! With Hans Zimmer AND James Newton Howard at the helm, how could it go wrong? The score sets the mood in every scene, giving an epic and thrilling tone. During the action sequences it really ups the adrenaline. And on the topic of action, The Dark Knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and car chases in a comic book adaptation yet. With no obvious or over-use of CGI, the explosions and accidents are the real deal. Thrilling, edge of your seat and violent, this is brutally awesome stuff.Nevertheless, none of this would be possible without Christopher Nolan, the man behind it all. Pairing up with the writer (and brother) Jonathon Nolan, the darkest Batman movie yet is the best, and the best so far this year. This does not feel like a comic book film, the dialogue and situations feel so realistic. And, it IS the script that drives this film. The dialogue is very, very well written and is the centre of the conflict and the movie.It may be bold to say this, but this is the best superhero film of all time. There are others that are magnificent (""Superman"" and ""X-Men"" are two examples) but this is the most complex, the most dark and the most spectacular and epic of them all. See it for Bale, for Ledger, for the music, the action and for Nolan's flawless direction.5/5 and the best film of 2008 so far!!","

Heath ledgers preformance is nothing short of phenomenal and arguably the best preformance we've ever been given in a superhero film.

However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'.","

"The Dark Knight","classicsoncall","21 July 2008","So it finally happened, a DC Comics movie adaptation that out-marveled the Marvel folks, and to such a degree that it might be quite a while before anything comes close to topping ""The Dark Knight"". This was the severely grim and gritty version of the Batman, ushered in by Frank Miller's initial treatment in the landmark graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Returns"" in 1986. Miller's portrayal of the iconic super hero took the gloves off as far as politically correct behavior goes. The movie explores this theme at many levels, and would have served up enough of a plot to keep this viewer interested even without the explosions, chases and general mayhem that modern day audiences need to get their fix on. Actually, the Joker summed it all up quite brilliantly hanging upside down from one of Batman's cables over the streets of Gotham, as noted in my summary line above. In the comic book world, they HAVE been fighting each other forever, or as long as forever exists since the creation of Batman back in 1939; the Joker came on the scene in 1940 in the comic, Batman #1.I don't think this could have been the same picture without Heath Ledger in the role of Batman's all time greatest nemesis. His portrayal blows away Jack Nicholson's performance in 1989's ""Batman"", and that's through no fault of Nicholson's. Today's films are a product of harsher and deadlier times, and it's striking that Ledger's characterization would define the Joker as an extremist, perhaps even a terrorist. More than once I found myself questioning what was going on during the opening bank robbery scene. The bad guys were offing each other based on instructions delivered by the Joker, and you suddenly come to the realization that this domino game had to end with one man standing. It's how we're introduced to Ledger's definitive Joker, a performance that won't be topped.Another thought came to me as I watched the story unfold, and that was how similar the coin toss gimmick paralleled the one in ""No Country For Old Men"". Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) began using the tactic following the death of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and I began picturing Javier Bardem in the role of The Joker. Hard to imagine who might have been the more evil character, Bardem's Anton Chigurh in a more realistic setting, or The Joker in a fictional Gotham City. Fortunately, not a choice one would normally have to consider.I'm a little bit on the fence as to Christian Bale's portrayal of The Batman. He's more than adequate as Bruce Wayne, but the voice he gives to the Dark Knight seems a bit melodramatic. Granted, he couldn't use the same voice as his alter ego, but there were times that it sounded so forced as to come across as parody, and other times just goofy, almost a throwback to the Adam West days of the TV Batman. Strange, but have you considered that no one ever calls him the Caped Crusader anymore either?All in all, great performances all around. Gary Oldman's portrayal of the new Commissioner Gordon was excellent, while Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox were solid even with limited screen time. I thought about Katie Holmes just once while making a mental comparison when Maggie Gyllenhaal first appeared on screen. Truthfully, they looked similar enough to effect the transition smoothly to the point where it wasn't distracting for me in the least.Obviously, the set up for the next sequel was firmly set in place with the creation of Two Face, the now alter ego of District Attorney Harvey Dent. The rendering of Dent's burned face was boldly executed and quite marvelous in it's own grotesque way. I'll be looking forward to the next installment.And NOW, for a personal rant. I probably should put this in parentheses because it doesn't have anything to do with the movie, but for this picture to be #1 on the IMDb list of all time best movies after 4 days of release is incomprehensible, if not downright laughable (and I did rate it a 10 myself). I think there should be a moratorium of at least a couple of years before a film qualifies for IMDb ranking, giving the dust some time to settle from all the grand opening hoopla that surrounds a picture like this. I feel the same way about other recent movies like ""No Country For Old Men"" and ""There Will Be Blood"", both of which garnered numerous awards and fan approval. But if they're to be considered among the best films of all time, they'll be considered that way a decade from now without the need for multiple votes from over zealous fan boys.","

"The Dark Knight","the-movie-guy","17 July 2008","(Synopsis) Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Dark Knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the Joker (Heath Ledger) has taken over organized crime. The Joker's plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos, and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal, which makes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him.(My Comment) This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Michael Caine fits the part of Alfred, the trusted butler. Heath Ledger's performance as the sadistic Joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to meet the Joker in a dark alley, and whatever you do, don't ask him how he got his smile, especially, when he has a knife in his hand. Ledger's performance has turned the Joker into a new iconic movie villain image. Between all the punches, mayhem, and explosions, there is some good sinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action, it also tells the story of the internal struggle that Bruce Wayne is having with being the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The movie explores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain, as well as Order verses Anarchy, and the Joker explains to Batman that to have one you must have the other, and because of that, they will always be connected. The movie is long, but it went by so fast. You will love the last 45 minutes, because of the non-stop action with Batman in his new sonic suit and his BatPod. With all the explosions, body count, and the dark mood of the movie, I don't think parents should take young children. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:32, Rated PG-13)(10/10)","

"The Dark Knight","springsunnywinter","14 July 2008","Batman has always been my favourite superhero ever since the first time I heard about him because he his human with no powers, also he is much more questionable than any other superhero. The story of the film is about Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new district attorney Harvey Dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague Gotham City. They are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Joker appears in Gotham. Batman's struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to ""confront everything he believes"" and to improve his technology (which introduces the recreation of the Batcycle, known as the Batpod and the Batsuit was redesigned) to stop the madman's campaign of destruction. During the course of the film, a love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent and Rachel Dawes.There are now six Batman films and I must say that The Dark Knight is the best out of all of them. The title is good because that is what Batman actually is. It has been 3 years for the adventure to continue from Batman Begins but that entire wait was worth it. Gotham city is very Gothic looking and is very haunting and visionary. The whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense, ingenious special effects and riveting performances from a first-rate cast especially from Heath Ledger who gave an Oscar nomination performance for best supporting-actor. It is a shame that he can't see his terrific work on-screen. The cinematography is excellent which is made so dark & sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. Usually sequels don't turn out to be better than the original but The Dark Knight is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like The Godfather 2. I also really liked the poster where the building is on fire in a Bat symbol & Batman is standing in front of it. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and his film Memento is one of my most favourite films. He hasn't made 10 movies yet and 3 of them are already on the IMDb top 250. Overall The Dark Knight is the kind of movie that will make the audience cheer in the end instead of throwing fruit & vegetables on the screen.","

"The Dark Knight","guerillagorilla","16 July 2008","I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars.","

"The Dark Knight","LennyRenquist","16 July 2008","I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together  movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new  insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in  his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an  honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting  perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet.  But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be  viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN'  MASTERPIECE of a superhero film.  To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would  be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'.  While watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is  usually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not  actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical  musings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over  in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants  to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical  pace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to  do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the  viewer's interest.  And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of  big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff  going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and  there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too.  But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is  brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first  two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down  to the cast.  Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val  Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and  committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us  feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose  it's pretty appropriate.  Heath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and  thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar?  Is that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get  one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died?  But...well...how can I put it...?   It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero,  but after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just  looks...well...lame.  If you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you  need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment.  Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first  one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more  emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was  necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with  Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such  garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She  rocks.  As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to  say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you  get the idea.  Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz.  Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK.  Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics.  Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath  and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular  talent. Go Gaz.  Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister!  The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed  entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and  action.  I've liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman & Robin),  but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary.","

A triumvirate of Gotham forms a cordon, The Batman, Harvey Dent, Lieutenant Gordon, but they're seduced by the performance, limited by laws conformance, the playmaker relishing, all the destruction. It's not too long before their weaknesses are found, as hostages are taken to compound, ultimatums are presented, prominent profiles are demented, and our hero runs for cover, goes underground.","

"The Dark Knight","rustyalex2","16 July 2008","Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!","

"The Dark Knight","Mush_Man29","16 July 2008","I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film. It was always going to be good, and sadly, it was always going to be over-hyped by the advertising warhorses.It is rare though, that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film. Nolan (The Prestige, Begins) delivers on more than the Joker we remember from the 'Old Days' of Burton and Nicholson. Instead we're given a psychopathic sadist who pleasures from sheer anarchy.All the hailing of Ledger's performance are grounded. Watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than you'd remember from any other film. It's impossible, quite literally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars, makes you laugh at his sick jokes, then makes you instantly wonder why you're laughing.If Ledger wasn't enough to horrify you - wait for Harvey Dent. Brilliantly portrayed by Aaron Eckhart as Gotham's 'fallen White Knight' and Batman's direct counterpart. His transformation will put Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal look like children's breakfast cartoons. Gyllenhaal had perfect chemistry with both Bale and Eckhart, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both work well as Batman's 'conscience' and of course, Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon were all solid.There are some major differences between The Dark Knight and Begins. Firstly, the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the 'majestic but unfinished' tones of Begins - but it suits the film's tone: Anarchy in every sense. There was a more solid singular villain (compared with the many in Begins) - but there was also a lot more henchmen in TDK. The martial art direction was faster and more efficient - as mentioned in the film, learning through experience.I was disappointed at the role of Scarecrow in this film, it just felt like a loose thread and wasn't quite closed up or explained, and the ending, while it wasn't what I expected (others have said that it was predictable, but for me it wasn't) was solid and suited the film well.All in all, this is a film that is quite close, if it isn't already, a masterpiece. Nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous 'Superhero' adaptations (Spiderman and Fantastic Four for example), there isn't campiness creeping in. In face, if Batman Begins was 10/10, The Dark Knight deserves a 12. Quite simply, the best possible sequel that could've been given.If you watch this (which I implore that you do), you certainly won't regret it. One of the best movies of 2008 (I'll wait till Quantum of Solace comes out before I pass judgement) - but certainly a film worth getting excited for. If you don't like it, then that's also fine - but keep in mind that you probably thought Meet The Spartans was a good movie, so the rest of us won't take it to heart.Stunning in every aspect, and exceeds all hype and expectation... Can't wait to watch it again, or for the Blu-Ray!","

"The Dark Knight","planktonrules","24 July 2008","I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.As of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN! Let's have a bit of perspective here--it's a very, very good film but the cult members out there need to get a grip.","

"The Dark Knight","gbill-74877","14 January 2022","Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant, and anytime he's on the screen this action film seems elevated. It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g. Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker's sadistic psychological cruelty, could have been a masterpiece. All in all it's a good, entertaining film, but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings it's received.","

"The Dark Knight","straightblaster","9 July 2008","We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there.","

"The Dark Knight","Sleepin_Dragon","6 January 2023","A new force threatens Gotham City, and The Face of The Joker is always smiling.It is almost as is Christopher Nolan cherry picked all of the best elements from The Batman backlog, I include the previous movie, The Burton years, Adam West era etc, and forged together something quite incredible, making not just The best Batman movie of all time, but arguably one of the greatest movies of all time.Two and a half magical hours, this film excels in every conceivable field, it is wonderfully dark, atmospheric and moody, but in equal measures it is exciting, action packed and dynamic.The story couldn't be better, it's so good, it'll appeal to those that don't even enjoy superhero movies, it really is that good. Packed with incredible action scenes, it's visually awesome.Christian Bale is once again fabulous, this Batman is a little petulant, a little impatient, but wonderfully intense. What every hero needs though, is a villain, and what takes this film up another level, is Heath Ledger, who's remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishing.An incredible supporting cast once again, Caine and Freeman once again show why they're Hollywood royalty.Superior to pretty much everything else.10/10.","

That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10/10.","

"The Dark Knight","miscellaneous411","19 July 2008","The Dark Knight maintained the intensity and overall gunmetal grayish feel that sets this Batman apart. The film takes us to a Gotham City that has grown accustomed to the big bat's crime-fighting crusades, and the last remaining big time criminals have actually grown fearful of his wrath. They form an alliance to attempt to keep their illicit business activities alive but are feeling even more pressure from yet a different angle: the passionate and fearless new district attorney, Harvey Dent. Recognizing the crime group's looming extinction, a stranger enters their circle and offers what he thinks is the only solution: kill Batman.The bad guys don't know if they can trust this seemingly demented madman, and they later learn the hard way that they don't really have a choice, for the most disturbing part of the Joker's personality is his motive. He doesn't care about money or power. He just enjoys causing trouble and watching, with pleasure, from the sidelines, as the terrorized city scrambles in mayhem...which leads me to the real star of this film, Heath Ledger.Ledger's performance as the Joker is astounding and consuming. We come face-to-face with a villain bearing the coldness of a psychopath and a personality that remains as mysterious and inexplicable as the real reason for the scars on his face. He develops the air of the lone offender quite early on as he nonchalantly kills those who help him commit his crimes. Yet, he has no problem building an army of followers, and the viewers easily find that believable. As insane as he is, he's focused and quite determined. Ledger also brings the Joker's humor to the role, but he does it in a way that is unique to this interpretation...with subtlety and honesty. The very words and mannerisms that made me laugh also evoked feelings of sadness in its clarity. The evil is incredibly convincing.Although Batman is a character that is often marketed towards kids, this film is definitely not appropriate for young children. In addition to the dark images, the violence, both seen and implied, is sometimes unsettling, and Ledger's Joker is chilling even for adult viewers. Having said that, this is, by far, one of the best films I've ever seen, and it will easily find a place in my personal top ten. I am only disappointed that this Joker, the best villain in a film since Hannibal Lecter, will never be revealed to us again.","

"The Dark Knight","Tweekums","22 October 2013","This, the second of director Cristopher Nolan's Batman trilogy opens with a bank robbery; the robbers are all wearing clown masks and when each has finished his part of the job he is killed by one of his colleagues. When only one is left he removes his mask to reveal a disturbing face; he is wearing predominantly white make up with black around his eyes and a disturbing red smile he is The Joker and clearly he is insane. It turns out the money he stole belonged to the mob and they are worried about losing the rest; either to The Joker or to the forces of law and order. Leading the campaign against crime in Gotham is a new white knight; DA Harvey Dent; a man who intends to take down the criminals by using the system rather than hiding behind a mask. Soon Dent, Lt. Gordon and Batman are after The Joker; and he in turn is after them and those they love.I put off watching this for a long time fearing I'd be disappointed; surely no film could live up to the hype this one received It turned out I needn't have worried; this is a fantastic film. The returning cast members perform well but it is the new characters that really stand out. Heath Ledger certainly deserved his Oscar; his Joker is genuinely disturbing, Aaron Eckhart is great too in the roll of Harvey Dent and Maggie Gyllenhaal shines as his girlfriend, and Bruce Wayne's old friend Rachel. Those wanting action will be pleased as it rarely stops and is spectacular; this doesn't mean there is any sacrifice of good characterisation and plot though. There are some good surprises along the way as well as a degree of tragedy. If you think superhero films are for children you should be aware that there are plenty of disturbing and even brutal moments here which might disturb youngsters I was a little surprised that it got a UK '12' certificate; it is certainly a 'high 12'. Overall I'd say don't worry about the hype just sit back and enjoy an excellent action film that just happens to have a superhero as its main character.","

"The Dark Knight","yarden-malka14","20 April 2012","Let's open this review with the fact that Batman is THE BEST superhero ever, with no other even coming close to his levels. So when a sequel is made for an unforgettable movie like ""Batman Begins"" expectations are EXTREMELY high. I think that if you could describe this movie in a few words it would be ""152 minutes of pure awesomeness."" Christopher Nolan probably created the best ever comic book adaptation of a movie. The movie itself has been adapted in a much more realistic fashion than the comic book series. First of all this movie is PERFECT for people who like punches, drama, shooting and explosions. The movie has a complicated plot that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. It's anything BUT corny, since a few important characters die, and the ending isn't happy, but it's flawless. Christian Bale has proved himself one again as an amazing actor. Michael Cane (portrays Alfred Pennyworth) makes you fall in love with Batman's loyal butler. Now anyone that has seen the movie and is reading this review is probably wondering why I haven't mentioned the main reason why this movie is flawless. And yes, there is ONE main reason: Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger portrayed Batman's arch nemesis in this movie: the Joker. Now anyone who has a clue in comic books knows that the Joker is INCREDIBLE. Heath Ledger's acting in this movie has turned the Joker into a LEGEND. I have never seen such perfect and realistic acting than the portrayal of the Joker in this movie. The Joker is portrayed in a much more mature fashion than the comic books, and that's why it was so good. It's simply impossible to describe him: he's bold, insane, smart, twisted and he's so awesome in this film that at some points you love him even more than Batman. If I haven't mentioned it by now, this is without a doubt the best movie I have seen.Those who come with high expectations after seeing ""Batman Begins"" will not be disappointed. I advise that no one under the age of 11 watches this movie as Two-Face's appearance is rather frightening and the film contains intense action.","

"The Dark Knight","gavin6942","5 August 2008","After defeating the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), Batman and Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) have little time to return to normal life. The mafia is growing, and there's a new menace prowling the streets: The Joker (Heath Ledger, in his last performance). Can the Batman handle a villain who has no morals, no goals, no methods and is completely unpredictable? Also, a love triangle forms between Wayne, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).There's little use in writing a review of ""The Dark Knight"" -- the critics loved it, fans love it, the sales are going through the roof and are likely to pass every record ever set. And I loved it, too, making it easily the film of the year and both an action-packed thriller as well as a bit of a tear-jerker. Heck, even small amounts of comic relief were thrown in (especially if you like dark humor).I could make complaints: the spinning camera shots were overdone. The Batman voice -- digitally altered for no good reason -- was excessively gruff. The ""Bat-Sonar"" was far-fetched, cheesy and pointless. And bullet reconstruction to get a fingerprint? Doubtful. And the Wayne-Batman character was largely flat and uninteresting, encouraging fans to root for the Joker. So, there was room for perfection (which is why this film, as great as it is, cannot receive a perfect score).Concerns aside, the film was well done, as Christopher Nolan and Bale work well together (see ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Prestige""). The action is intense, the violence superb for a PG-13 film. There's some suspense, plot twists, unexpected deaths. The romance aspect is a bit unclear (when does this film take place -- Rachel seems to have found a fiancé fairly fast). And Heath Ledger, oh my.The hype around this fill was very Ledger-centric, declaring him as Oscar-worthy. I thought this was exaggerated due to his untimely demise and was therefore disrespectful. However, the praise was well-deserved. This was the Joker, inside and out. I couldn't even visually Ledger under the makeup. I'll always love Jack Nicholson's portrayal, but Ledger brings his ""A"" game. If he is nominated, I accept it; and if he wins, that seems reasonable to me. Best performance so far this year, in any genre.As I said in the beginning, my review is pretty much just more or what you've already heard. The rumors are true, but judging by the sales of the picture, you've already seen it and know first-hand. If you haven't, see it in the theater while you can. Or rent it. Not sure if it's a movie worth owning (I can't see myself watching it repeatedly, depending on the special features). But this may be the superhero movie that defines the genre.","

"The Dark Knight","TheLittleSongbird","3 April 2010","I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.The film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.The plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.And I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.Overall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox","

"The Dark Knight","SimonJack","31 July 2008","Many commenters said they were ""blown away,"" so it probably has succeeded in blowing away the box office. I waited until the second week, and had high expectations from the 9 and 10 ratings it was receiving. But, fellow movie/film viewers (and especially great film lovers) ... really!? There's no doubt about the action and action and action in this one, and thus, the special effects. That's the main reason I enjoy such fantasy flicks -- the comic book genre. So, this one does more of it and perhaps better than the last Batman and the last Spiderman and the last super heroes (but I would not rank it up with Iron Man). So, special effects and makeup may earn it awards.Maybe I'm beginning to burn out on all the action and special effects of movies, though. Or perhaps I need more from a movie. With 45 minutes to go, I was ready for it to end. It was way too long. Some reviewers thought the acting was superb. What acting -- do they mean the one- or two-minute interludes between the fast and furious segments of action and destruction? I'm not down on any of the actors for their roles or parts -- but where were there any parts of substance in acting? True, Heath Ledger does a very good Joker. But, then, who hasn't (Nicholson, et al) who have ever played those roles in Batman, Superman, etc? As for plot -- well, anyone who knows the genre and a story that combines Batman with the Joker, knows to expect the unexpected with the Joker. So, the plot goes from one unexpected to another -- as though the variety and mixture and change in ""unexpecteds"" is trying to outdo the action mayhem.When I saw that this stands as #1 in the top 250 right now, I clicked on the list. But how this movie for acting and plot (and yes, even action in many cases) could rank up there with the likes of the Lord of the Rings, the Star Wars films, and many great classics with real suspense (I have to mention Casablanca, Vertigo, North by Northwest), is beyond me. I'm not that far off with the overall trends in the IMDb reviews, but can't agree with so many who rate this film at the top.It's good and entertaining -- but too long. It's not great, by any means. I love the youth of today (I have a few grandchildren), and I don't mean to disparage them by this observation -- but I think this high acclaim by many for this film may reflect a very large, very young audience, most members of whom don't have a great deal of quality and varied films in their viewing history. To all of those young people, I urge a look at the top 250 list or other major review ratings -- and then that you rent, borrow or otherwise watch some of the other great films. I promise you won't be disappointed or bored --and you may get an understanding (maybe appreciation for) of some past customs, life styles, dress, behaviors, etc. To be sure, you will have great entertainment.","

"The Dark Knight","claudio_carvalho","31 December 2008","Batman (Christian Bale) joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), to fight the organized crime in Gothan City. However, chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker (Heath Ledger) that brings a wave of violence and murders. The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity, and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City.""The Dark Knight"" is a great surprise for a blockbuster, with a solid and deep story, great direction, performances, special effects and make-up. The adventure is also dramatic, with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics, morality, human nature, hope and other important themes. The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker, and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in T-Bag, from ""Prison Break"", and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper. But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death. In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is a great movie, the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008, but the IMDb User Rating (Top 250: #4) is absolutely overrated, ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDb's Rating; but ""sometimes the truth is not good enough"". My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""O Cavaleiro das Trevas"" (""The Dark Knight"")","

"The Dark Knight","diac228","20 July 2008","I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.*Runs* The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it? We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reasonbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips? Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the ""yang"" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the ""yin""; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven.","

And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film.","

"The Dark Knight","nowego","16 May 2017","I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to see.The Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of 2005.Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie, add him to Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred, then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magic.I am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in 1000 words or less, but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinion.If you have not already seen this movie after 9 years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now. You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this somehow and see it.One of the easiest movies to rate 10 out of 10.","

There were several shots in the film that had me saying ""Now how in the hell did they do that?!"", Brilliant scores by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer. Every actor shines, no one person steals the film.

"The Dark Knight","himaank","17 August 2008","There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style. The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music. Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography. Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead. As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!","

"The Dark Knight","marimbadaddy","22 February 2009","The Dark Knight was probably the best action film I've ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that we've not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledger's best performance from his all too short career.The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesn't use too much ""face time"" on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right.","

"The Dark Knight","johnnyboyz","25 July 2008","Some of the very first words Christian Bale utters as the eponymous role of 'soon-to-be-Batman' Bruce Wayne, in the preceding Batman film to this entitled Batman Begins, are to a thug in a remote prison located in the Far East: ""you're not The Devil, you're practise"" he hisses. The feeling's that 2008's The Dark Knight is where the practise ends and the fight with The Devil begins. This is my second crack at writing something up about the film, and while what I said initially was a little unfocused and targeted the wrong areas; I stand by the initial grade I gave it and similarly retained that similar sense of feeling underwhelmed when it finished. Even if it is deemed that The Dark Knight is one of the better comic book adaptations ever made, this is not saying a terrible lot given the bulk of entries in said film canon.That old problem of dealing with the war genre and doing one's very best to document war as a horrid, gut-wrenching thing whilst maintaining sequences of war that cannot help but carry a sense of spectacle anyway, rears its head here. The Dark Knight documents a war on terrorism and sees Christohper Nolan attempt to echo a greater sense of things in the real world as he unleashes a character known as The Joker (Ledger) amongst the inhabitants of Gotham City, The results of his terrorist 'acts' in bringing down entire buildings allow Nolan to shoot the wreckage of said act with firefighters in the foreground and smoking rubble in the back, clearly calling on immediate 'post' imagery of the 9/11 New York attacks. Incidentally, and as one source which escapes me suggested, Joker's videos of captives held and forced to talk into video cameras evoke the actions of overseas terrorist cells, and their own methods of getting the message across to The West; while most of his scenes in which he is seen pottering around an area trying to intimidate carry an odd, distorted and erratic hand held aesthetic suggesting danger, distortion and chaos. Later on, semiology linked to fire fighting will be used again in the briefest of fashions, when a certain character, who's under threat from The Joker, is being transported in a police van: a burning fire truck is used as a blockade, and Nolan cleverly instills a further sense of victimised anguish into the audience.In addition to biting all of this off, Nolan does his best to render the film a gangster film-come-neo noir whilst operating under this banner of a low MPAA/BBFC rating as the film additionally attempts to draw on parallels between The Joker, Batman and a third piece to the triangle in district attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart). Indeed the film opens with an audacious robbery of mob money, as perpetrated by The Joker; his menace established by the fact his cohorts contribute varying perspectives of the man whilst we perceive him to still be off screen. The robbery itself carries a clever twist in that each member kills the other when his job is done, a small but highly affecting twinge to proceedings as dreamt up by The Joker thus cementing his personality and mindset in being able to cook up something such as this. As a fighter of crime, Dent lacks the physical strength Batman does but talks a good talk and is able to place a number of criminals in jail after some hard work as he adopts his own stance on the front line of crime. Shortly afterwards, it is Gary Oldman's police lieutenant Jim Gordon whom refers to him as Gotham's ""white knight"", suggesting the man shares a similar overview to Batman's ""dark"" but is just different in technique and characteristics.Joker's parallel with Batman sees the film establish such a relationship by way of two accompanying scenes, one seeing The Joker and a handful of representatives from Gotham's gangs occupy a kitchen and talk of certain issues. Annoyingly, the representatives are your more generic bling-wielding African-Americans; well dressed Italian American mobsters and gruff, greasy haired eastern European criminals. Cut to Gordon, Batman and Dent beside the bat signal doing the exact same thing but whose discussions and ideologies obviously differ; a later pairing of sequences seeing The Joker deal with a black criminal, whom he feels ought to be working with him, in a blunt fashion just as Batman does the same to a Chinese businessman named Lau whom he feels similarly towards in this sense, thus suggesting a more intrinsic link between the two. As is the rule of thumb in films such as Heat or American Gangster, Joker and Batman share a sequence in which they sit opposite one another at a table; on this occasion, and as other sources have stated, right before contemporary issues on the treatment of terrorists once in custody have arisen.Where the film falls apart is its want to cater to an audience with superhero sub-genre frills, an interesting parallel drawn up between Dent as a frothing at the mouth monster named Two-Face seeking revenge and Batman, as two people differently channelling anger born out of injustices towards people they love plays out, but getting bogged down with out of sorts fight scenes and ridiculous sequences in 'sonar vision' which does nothing but juvenalise adult content. Most of the second unit stuff is nowhere near as interesting as the talk and studious observations on identity and personality; a chase through a tunnel which spills onto the streets involving a police van; a large truck and a bat-bike rather underwhelming. The film relies on rife corruption all too often to further its narrative so as to send it down another avenue of twists and turns, ultimately a story which is not as interesting as all the aforementioned character studies and power play going on as binary opposites supposedly attract and everybody's linked to each other. Ultimately only fleetingly interesting, and all too often feels bogged down.","

The best coupling by far, in fact when I used to have my grandson over we watched Batman 'The dark night' repeatedly.

"The Dark Knight","JohnSeal","19 July 2008","Time for a corrective. As I write this review, The Dark Knight is, according to IMDb voters, the Best. Film. Ever. At the risk of incurring a hail of brickbats, I must demur. Yes, Heath Ledger delivers an excellent performance, as does Gary Oldman as Lieutenant--er, COMMISSIONER Gordon--and it's always a pleasure to watch Michael Caine and Aaron Eckhart. But The Dark Knight is an overlong, over plotted, logically flawed, and philosophically confused film that cannot (and should not) be mistaken for great art. Compared to most comic book movies, it's not bad. Compared to La Regle du Jeu, it ain't so hot. The film's first half is actually quite good, and seems to come to a timely conclusion somewhere around the eighty minute mark. Unfortunately, this being a summer blockbuster, there's another 70 plus minutes to go, and the film's second half is a distinct letdown. Instead of ending on a neat and tidy note, The Dark Knight spirals off into a muddled mess of bizarre plotting (how DID that prisoner get the bomb sewn into him?), illogic (how does Harvey escape the hospital explosion--and why is he apparently impervious to pain?) and confusing action (too many ass-kickings in too little time). I don't expect 100% logical consistency from my genre product, but there are so many flaws and elisions of simple common sense in Christopher Nolan's screenplay that utter frustration sets in around the two-hour mark. By the end of the film, we're expected to believe that, for some reason, the residents of Gotham now need to revile Batman rather than reward him for his good work, setting up a police pursuit into the sunset that presumably will end with our hero receiving a ticket for speeding on the Batcycle. So let's tell it like it is: in terms of 2008 comic book flicks, The Dark Knight is inferior to both Hellboy II (which at least is charming and amusing) and Hancock (which raises far more interesting questions about the nature of the super hero).","

"The Dark Knight","dfranzen70","20 July 2008","Oddly enough, I don't go into a theater before watching a blockbuster movie with the expectation that it'll be over-hyped and bloated; that's just how it turns out from time to time. No, I have reasonable expectations just like the next guy.As I check out the reactions to The Dark Knight, I notice a common thread - everyone likes the movie. Particularly, everyone seems enamored of Heath Ledger's unhinged, magnificent, and terrifying performance as The Joker. Straight out, I want to make clear that I completely agree. Ledger isn't just some ham acting out in a clown costume; we had Jack Nicholson do that already, nearly twenty years ago. Ledger commands the screen not with an over-the-top performance but a scene-stealing, subtle one. His makeup masks not only a despicable demon who hurts for the sake of causing pain but also a troubled, carefully shaded character worthy of Shakespeare's finest plays.Let's first get to what I didn't like. Many of the main roles are miscast, sometimes badly so. Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, but if anything his performance is more wooden than in the movie's predecessor, Batman Begins. See, I've always thought the complex Batman character should be someone who's consumed by inner demons, one who even when unmasked reveals only some layers while hinting at much greater depths. And I never get that impression with Bale as Batman: He is what you see, and little more. Yes, we know he's got this secret identity thing going, and he doesn't tell people everything, and that's nice. Endearing, even. But Bale's inadequacies as an actor show up in spades here, because I never get the feeling that there's more than meets the eye. Bale's Batman doesn't feel like he's consumed by demons in the least; he seems like a pretty boy with a lot of money who likes to torture (yes, torture) and kill bad guys without any of the blame or acclaim.Moving along, we have a new Rachel Dawes, aka The Love Interest, played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's a monumental improvement over the wretched performance that Katie Holmes gave in Batman Begins. Even so, as has been noted elsewhere, Gyllenhaal is too intelligent, her eyes too ironically knowing, to play the role. She seems out of place, because she's smarter than Rachel Dawes - an assistant DA - is. (Of course, we don't see much of Rachel doing DA stuff; we see her running from place to place in a panic, or professing her love for Harvey Dent through nonverbal ways, or smiling coquettishly.) So: Like the Maggie Gyllenhaal, a LOT, but she was far better than her character was written. Someday they'll get it right.And then there's the third wheel to the love triangle: Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Now, you have to set aside Tommy Lee Jones's performance as Dent in one of the earlier Batman movies, because this is a new Bativerse, and it's like those other movies never happened. Dent eventually becomes the physically and mentally scarred Two-Face, but Eckhart can't quite handle the heavy lifting that the complicated character demands. When you see Eckhart, you think of likable cad, the slightly slimy guy who's better than the real hero at basically everything. But in a charming way. Here, Dent's a noble crusader, the district attorney who's going to clean up Gotham, but Eckhart is just another toothy, slick, Ken doll who's there just to look good. The way Eckhart plays Dent, you'd think he was just an affable fellow who wants to do the right thing; as with Bruce Wayne, there doesn't seem to be any undercurrent of ulterior motives, nothing to see here, please disperse. Eckhart, despite having studied split personalities in preparing for the role, is clearly in way over his head here.The movie itself is overlong, even bloated. It seems the in thing nowadays to have a movie end several times - you know, to keep the Great Unwashed on their toes. Oh my goodness! It's not over yet! What will happen next? But surely there's a way to do this without producing a film that's two and a half hours long. If you're going to make a movie that long, be my guest, but the movie should be more than our heroes running from action scene to action scene, particularly when those action scenes are in dark, dank Gotham City.But here are some positives, to make sure all bases are covered. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine exude effortless efficiency as Lucien and Alfred, respectively, doing far more for the movie than it for them. Both act as Bruce's conscience, and both roles were written as to be completely believable. Professionalism is always a plus when casting superhero movies. And some of those vaunted action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, although many of them seem to involve Batman jumping off a building, Batman climbing down the side of a building, or Batman throwing someone else off a building. In the dark. Because it's supposed to be gloomy ol' Gotham.So for me, The Dark Knight was a disappointment. It's not a bad little film, but it felt too loose, as if writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan had decided on an ending and then threw everything they could think of into the plot to reach that goal. This happens to a lot of middling action films - the hero races to point A, escapes certain death, races to point B, escapes certain death, repeat ad infinitum. Same sort of thing here, only we don't even get clever plotting that we might expect from what's purportedly a higher grade of superhero movie. There's much chaos in The Dark Knight, but ultimately the maelstrom of disorder consumes, rather than engages, the viewer. Dark Night is elegy to the great potential - realized and unrealized - that's forever lost with the death of Heath Ledger.","

"The Dark Knight","Hitchcoc","12 January 2009","This movie has everything. The cameras, the sounds, the really cool characters. For me, it's one of few adventure movies worth watching more than once. And, of course, Heath Ledger is as awesome as everyone says. The characterization is so much deeper than the other films. We get to see multidimensional people with purpose, even if the purpose to to kill and maim. We care about what happens for a change and we go along for the ride. A small criticism is that it is awfully long and it takes so much time to resolve itself. Also, people do some pretty stupid things, considering what a threat this guy is. These are little things and without them we wouldn't have the huge finale.","

"The Dark Knight","IamtheRegalTreatment","15 July 2008","Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: ""If you only see one movie this summer, this is it"". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark Knight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released all year. Period.I had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this movie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first IMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were flying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie? Well, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well. Since Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this movie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was Heath Ledger's part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can agree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a joker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard to tackle.Looking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene unnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that perfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get. I also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie Holmes wouldn't be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined her character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely.So after all was said and done, this movie to me was just about perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said 'forget the rest'. This is top notch... I want to watch it again.","

This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.Nolan has made his ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect. Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don't, then something beez wrongz with youz!","

"The Dark Knight","MLDinTN","16 June 2009","I really wanted to see this in the theater;however, I never did last summer. Instead I waited till it came on cable, and after watching it; I really didn't miss anything by not going to the theater. I was rather disappointed because I was expecting this to be as good as Spiderman, but I don't think it was. I thought it was rather slow moving with sparse action scenes. I mean Batman on the chopper really wasn't that much action. A lot of films have had better car chasing scenes then that.And I really didn't think Heath Ledger was anything special in this. His role was just a lot of hype. Probably the best role was by Aaron Eckhart and the special effects with his face at the end.I also have to comment on Christian Bale's Batman voice. What was he trying to do?? He sounded like a chronic smoker with emphysema.FINAL VERDICT: It was good, just not as good as advertised. I don't get why so many people thought it was the best comic book movie to be made.","

"The Dark Knight","ma-cortes","9 January 2010","Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) accords a deal with the lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the district attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and his sweetheart-assistant(Maggie Gyllenhaal) for eliminate definitively criminality at Ghotam. However , a mysterious delinquent and psychotic villain named The Joker (Heath Ledger)begins a new wave of criminal rampage and terror. Batman is only helped by his attendant named Alfred(Michael Caine) and his scientific (Morgan Freeman).This is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie . Full of action , it's complemented by violent images, thriller and breathtaking scenes with overwhelming computer generator special effects. The picture relies in terrific flying sequences , impressive fights, and breathtaking pursuits. The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Batman begins (2005)¨ also directed by Christopher Nolan ; booth movies result to be an intense variation on Bob Kane's comic book creation. Our superhero, well incarnated by Christian Bale dons the suit and cape, for that reason he can to be identified with the rest of his life as Batman and he deserves credit for remaining true to character.A well-intentioned and interesting plot by David S. Goyer based on the characters created by Bob Kane, following the events developed in Batman Begins and repeating some actors as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy , among others. Suspenseful musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard , and colorful, dark cinematography by Wally Pfister. The film takes off to provide some great moments and great fun as Superman swings into action. The picture is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan who has directed excellent movies as ¨The prestige¨, ¨Insomnia ¨ and ¨Memento¨ and is preparing Batman third part. This live action Batman was one of the highest grossing movie made in that year, as well as, Nolan's most prestigious efforts in that field. Rating : Very good. Better than average.","

"The Dark Knight","pbertovich05","18 October 2008","This was the most hyped movie of the year and probably one of the most hyped movies ever. Even with the overhype I had to see Heath Ledger play the joker because the trailers looked awesome. So I finally paid my ticket and watched the movie.The movie starts off really strong, the opening scene was an absolute blast (literally). From that point on though I didn't feel the same action. The rest of the movie just seemed, drawn out and completely over the top. Honestly where did the joker find a rocket launcher in Gotham City? This movie was just too long and much of the dialogue was something that a kid writes in senior creative writing and thinks it's brilliant. Also the director did an excellent job of warping the joker from one place to the next, the joker must have had a helicopter or a really loyal taxi driver. One second he's here and the next he's on top of that building. Probably the last straw was when Morgan Freeman showed up. He turns around and the camera is at a low angle as if to show the arrival of Morgan Freeman the ultimate modern narrator who is now in every movie, an older version of Samuel L Jackson who is soft spoken. They kind of made up for it when Debo from Friday showed up as the scary convict on the boat.After sitting in my seat for two and half hours as characters appeared and disappeared the movie finally ended, and it ended in a very cliché way. Way to say the title of the movie as the last word in the film, thats never been done ever?and The Dark Knight had to include the bain of every modern movie, being able to track people's cell phone calls. This little gimmick is in way too many movie these days.so ya I sat there for two and a half house and my butt really hurt, I wasted ten dollars on a cool movie, but one that wasn't as good as people claimed. Maybe next time Christian Bale will take some cough drops before showing up on set.","

"The Dark Knight","MovieMaster95","2 October 2010","When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made.","

"The Dark Knight","ametaphysicalshark","19 July 2008","Cards (hardy har har) on the table: Going into ""The Dark Knight"" in IMAX I did not think Christopher Nolan was a great director, I was not too taken by ""Batman Begins"" (although it was refreshing after Burton and Schumacher reminded me of the lesser Batman comics I have read, and, bizarrely for non-comedies, of the 60's television series and the film version of that, except less fun), I did not think Heath Ledger was among the great actors of his generation, I did not think Christian Bale was the best actor alive, and I was not expecting anything more than an entertaining Batman movie, despite being reassured by everyone I trust about movies that it was much more.Having seen it, as intended with the scenes filmed specifically for IMAX intact and covering the entire IMAX screen vertically, I can safely say that ""The Dark Knight"" is without question the first time the Batman character and the many great comics based in Gotham City have been done justice on film. Nolan's version of Batman is not meant to be realistic, it is meant to be plausible, and everything here including Two-Face feels plausible. Still, the film has not forsaken its comic book roots. This is not the watered-down Batman of the 50's, this is the Batman conceived in the 30's and re-born in the 80's. Moments here, thanks to Ledger's astonishingly creepy and believable performance as the Joker (this is the original Joker. Bank robber with no motive, mass-murderer with not a hint of mercy, not the ludicrous clown Jack Nicholson horribly portrayed in Burton's 1989 effort), recall the great Batman book ""Arkham Asylum"". Others recall ""The Killing Joke"". As anyone who has read those books will testify, that is just about the highest praise I can give the portrayal of the Joker here.I do think that seeing this in IMAX enhances the experience, although it is a little annoying when the picture clarity goes from as clear as possible to clearly blown-up when the scene switches from those shot on IMAX cameras to those shot on regular film. One can really appreciate the sound design here as well, which is absolutely remarkable all the way through.This is, as far as I'm concerned, easily Nolan's best work as director. His handling of the film's pacing is absolutely stunning, and the action here is both filmed and edited much better than in ""Begins"". It is Nolan's work with actors that particularly impresses, with just about every moment of acting being superb here. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are phoning it in but they don't exactly need to be brilliant here. Bale, as well, displays little depth as Wayne, but embodies all his charm and makes for an excellent Batman (unless your perception of Batman is a wisecracking fool, then you might be disappointed). No, the acting I refer to here is the extraordinary performances by Ledger, Oldman, and Eckhart. Although Ledger will surely get all the attention (and he's certainly great here), I think that both Oldman and Eckhart stole the show a bit. Eckhart is better as Dent than Two-Face but the transformation is certainly not an easy task for any actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal is unquestionably better as Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes was, and Nestor Carbonell, not an actor with much range, is really very good as the Mayor of Gotham City.Over and over again film versions of Batman have disappointed. Has ""The Dark Knight"" finally got it right? No doubt some will moan and complain about it not being distinctive or stylized enough, not capturing the spirit of the comics. Guess what? You have been reading the WRONG comics. The best Batman comics may not always strive for plausibility, but they are certainly far from the 'silly fun' some might expect from ""The Dark Knight"". What you will get here is a tense, dramatic crime thriller with some breathtaking action set-pieces, remarkable characterization. The Joker being given such a complex psychological profile is a stunning achievement, and Ledger is terrifying in the role. You really believe that he is dangerous and his sick social experiments are nerve-wracking to witness.I have one or two misgivings about ""The Dark Knight"". I don't know if I would have handled Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent/Two-Face the way the Nolan brothers do in this screenplay, but virtually the rest of the film is pitch-perfect. The pace is astonishing (I could hardly believe the film was as long as it actually was), the acting is phenomenal, the visual look of the film is right, especially given the subtext Nolan is going for here (which you'll see when you've seen the film), the characters are rich, the drama is real, the action is spectacular, and finally- The Joker is given a definitive portrayal.Tim Burton once said, ""Anyone who knows me knows I would never read a comic book"". For shame, Mr. Burton. Maybe if you had you could have made something this good. ""The Dark Knight"" does the character of Batman justice, it does The Joker justice, and it does the great Batman comics justice. In two and a half hours ""The Dark Knight"" makes up for all the silly, offensive garbage adapted from comic books and graphic novels, and reveals just how much can be done with the characters and ideas in those books. This is finally a film that does justice to the Batman universe.","

"The Dark Knight","ccthemovieman-1","17 November 2008","This was extremely entertaining all the way through, which is quite a statement for a film that is two-and-a-half hours long. There are absolutely no dry spots in this fascinating film. Does everything make sense? Of course not; there are a lot of holes in the story, but it's a superhero action film and it's not meant to be dissected for credibility. It's just supposed to entertain, and that it does.A large part of the credit for that goes to Heath Ledger for his ""The Joker"" portrayal. Every scene in which Ledger appeared was riveting. His speech, mannerisms and his dialog were fantastic. For the latter, I have to commend the screen writers who gave Ledger some great lines!Actually, he and Aaron Eckert, who played ""Harvey 'Two Face' Dent,"" were most of the show, character-wise. Maggie Gyllenhaal was good, too, as ""Rachel Dawes,"" the woman of both Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent's affections. Otherwise, the familiar good guys - Christopher Bale as ""Batman,"" Michael Caine as ""Alfred,"" Gary Oldman as Inspector/Commishoner Gordan"" and Morgan Freeman as ""Lucius Fox"" were okay but all more interesting in the previous film, ""Batman Begins."" Speaking of Fox, his high-and-mighty attitude toward Wayne's surveillance system was disappointing to hear. I had thought he had trust in Bruce Wayne. Also, I was sorry to hear the language deteriorate in the final half hour with some unneeded profanity by some inconsequential character.Overall, however, this latest Batman movie ranks among the best of any I've seen, at least on the first viewing. I'm looking forward to watching it again when the Blu-Ray disc comes out next month. This is a great film to enjoy visually and audibly with some fantastic action scenes and excellent dialog.I had heard that Batman was a ""dark"" and almost unlikable figure, himself, in this film but I did not find that. Hey, he did what he had to do to stop a maniacal killer (which ""Fox"" didn't understand., nor some of the other main characters.) For a guy who has provided nothing but good deeds for the fickle citizens of Gotham over the years, this hero certainly doesn't appear to be appreciated......except by his fans of comics and film.In fact, that's the only main thing I would dispute with the writers of this movie: their conclusion at the end that Batman is ""not a hero, but a dark knight."" No, I would say someone who continually risks his life to save others is quite a hero!","

"The Dark Knight","evanston_dad","25 July 2008","Whatever else it may be, ""The Dark Knight,"" Christopher Nolan's follow up to his ""Batman Begins,"" the film that resurrected the Batman franchise, is the most ambitious superhero film ever made. It's full of brooding ruminations about the inherent nature of humanity, obviously fueled by the troubled state of a post-9/11 world, and it packs an awful lot of plot into its two-and-a-half-hour running time. However, be cautioned, and don't let its #1 rating at IMDb set up expectations that the film can't possibly meet. I doubt any experienced film goer is truly going to think that this is the best film ever made.The praise heaped on Heath Ledger for his performance as the Joker is well deserved. Indeed, the Joker becomes the focus of this movie, which may not be such a desirable thing, given that this is...you know....a Batman movie. The caped crusader fades into the background in this installment, to the point where you might leave the movie and forget that he was in it. Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the love interest, and who, true to the superhero movie formula, gets practically nothing to do. But Ledger you WILL remember. He creates a fascinating character in the Joker, and it's through him that the movie poses all of its major moral questions. Is it human nature, as the Joker suggests, to devolve into chaos when the illusion of order is taken away; or do humans have an inherent kindness that will cause them to look out for one another even when circumstances seem to call for self preservation? One of the most fascinating things about Ledger's creation is that the Joker has no more motive as a criminal than to pose questions like this. He's not out for money or even power -- he just wants to create anarchy and see what happens.I was not prepared for the other villain the screenplay throws into the mix: Two Face, played well by Aaron Eckhart. The film is too long, and it's this storyline that makes it so. Chrisotpher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, the co-writers of the film, would have done well to leave this plot line out. By the end of the film, there are too many characters doing too many things independently of one another, so that the film loses focus slightly.The movie looks fantastic though, and the production team does wonders with Chicago (where I live by the way). In fact the look of the film is one of its major selling points, and I was pleased to finally see a superhero film that looks cinematic rather than cartoonish.So...an excellent addition to the superhero genre and a completely entertaining experience....but it's still, after all, a Batman movie, and it's not the best film since ""Citizen Kane.""

"The Dark Knight","ivo-cobra8","11 October 2015","The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal and Morgan Freeman.The dark Knight (2008) is the best epic Science Fiction/Action Batman film today. A truly great Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, straight from the comic books.The film lives up to Batman and Batman Forever.Capturing scarecrow was awesome. The Fight sequences were so much better than in Batman Begins. This film has a Heart and everything that stands for this film. The Dark Knight is actually a symbol for hope. Batman doesn't kill people in here, that isn't for what Batman stands for. He only scares people that is it.When you watch The Dark Knight you have to put your brain in to it, to understand the movie and that is what I did.I love The Dark Knight in the Tomb bat mobile when blow something he wrote only scare so he does not kill people. Best Batman Line: ""I'm not wearing hockey pads!"" Terrific cast and awesome directors. Is the Batman movie I ever wanted! This film makes correct mistake that Batman Forever failed. The Dark Knight is a reboot of Batman Forever. It fix Batman Forever were that movie failed. Were Joel Schumacher failed with his Batman movies.I Still can't believe Batman Forever won 3.Oscars while The Dark Knight won only 2.Oscars ugh.But The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are the best movies made by comic books. The Dark Knight is much better because there is more Batman in it. By day he is Bruce Wayne by night he is Batman. There are more fighting sequences flying sequences he was in Hong Kong really fantastic. Joker was portrayed by Heath Ledger really awesome. Bruce Wayne was on his wonderful bike and then he was in his beautiful car. The Dark Knight beats the hell out of Batman Forever. The Dark Knight starts, they finally shows that Batman did catch Crane it was wonderful when he jumped on the van and he took Scarecrow's mask off. Crane did come back for 5.minutes but he was still awesome. Now after Batman won and he beat Ra's Al Ghul by trying to destroy Gotham City and stopping crime boss Falcone, this time in The Dark Knight, Batman must take on the Joker and the mob who hired Joker to kill the Batman. Batman Forever was Schumacher fiction the only thing Schumacher did right, was scene were Maroni scared Harvey Dent in the court room, that was the only right scene. It fix Batman Forever I forgot to mentioned they change the car in Batman Forever in The Dark Knight they destroyed the tomb but they change into a bike vehicle and Batman driving trough the mall with a bike was a fantastic Action sequence! Also Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut The Killing Joke, and the series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. The nickname ""the Dark Knight"" was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.It was Heath Ledger's brilliant performance as The Joker that made The Dark Knight a masterpiece. Heath Ledger's acting the Joker was believable, he was absolutely ,awesomely, amazing ,brilliant and fantastic. I never saw anyone or any actor playing a character like that, like Heath did. Not only Heath Ledger was in his best performance also Aaron Eckhart correct and performed Harvey Dent/Two-Face better than Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever, Action stunts were wonderful, Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely fantastic as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes was. Maggie did also much wonderful better performance than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. I am glad they cast Maggie in it, instead of shallow stupid dumb Katie Holmes.Aaron Eckhart was awesome great fantastic as Harvey Dent he was portrayed by comic books. Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever (1995) was purple, his design was half black, half purple, he wasn't portrayed right. Hollywood wanted that sequel to Batman Returns ugh.Harvey Dent wasn't a sidekick to Riddler he didn't even met him or become his partner, he didn't had two women's beside him. He was alone and he went on a revenge killing spree for Rachel Dawson 's death. Harvey Dents says We Kill the Bat or was the Riddler in this film is saying the Joker this lines. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Detective Jim Gordon. Whole cast in the film was wonderful and absolutely fantastic. It is really tragic that Heath Ledger that year died before the premiere. I heard a lot about fans crying over the﻿ actor's death that year. Finally Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman was good in his role which I like him much better in here than I did in Batman Begins.The film was released on 14 July 2008 (New York City, New York (premiere) in USA. The film also Features 37 minutes of IMAX footage, which Christopher Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film. CGI and special Effects are also awesome and aren't bad. Costume designer Lindy Hemming was awesome as she worked on the Batman, Harvey Dent and Joker costumes. The Dark Knight is the best Batman Epic Science Fiction Action film ever! It is beyond Amazing and I love this film to death!The Dark Knight score: A + .

"The Dark Knight","tedg","22 July 2008","Two things interesting about this for me. (I'll let others talk about Heath.)One is how much more of a comic book it is than a film. I don't mean that it is sillier or more fantastic, but that the values seem to be based on storyboards as panels. The implications are pretty interesting. All those Marvel productions are pretty much the same: the same level of fantasy, the same vocabulary of cinematic effects. The same slant from ""graphic novel"" framing to modern film traditions  which incidentally are less designed than are the accidents of common CGI compositing tools.This on the other hand is not cinematic. It makes it boring for me visually, but there's another result: the story. The story is not your standard long form arc. Its at least four stories concatenated, as if you would read a few pages and come back at the next lunch break. It rambles, it has real comicbook soap opera. I really do think of this as a comic book that accidentally finds itself in a film. That's as opposed to ""Sin City,"" which though based on a comic, and supposedly co- directed by the comic artist, is intensely cinematic, so much so you almost drown.The other feature for me: the handling of noir.Noir is all about how the viewer manipulates the action by viewing. It has permeated nearly every corner of film and most intelligent filmmakers try to play with it. It is the primary narrative tool we have to add depth by adding layers. The Nolans are intelligent filmmakers. While the film isn't very cinematic, the script is, in this regard. The novel trick here is the joker. Sure he is played well, and Ledger was becoming one of our foremost folded actors. But the thing works because the role was written to matter, and that's because he introduces a double noir fold. The watcher is in the film, and the watcher is ""writing"" the script regardless of any action that anyone in the film can take. Its classic noir doubled. The joker's key speeches even cover all the noir highlights: you have to ruin routine; you have to profoundly affect, even kill random innocents; you have to express an amazingly complex orchestration and make it seem capricious, accidental. You have to deny intent and complexity. You have to pretend to not be amused.All these things are embodied in what Ledger was given. This is very important writing, and if you know ""Prestige"" and ""Memento,"" even ""Following,"" you would have expected something like this. Even if the film isn't good as a film, the writing is, and that allows Heath to make a film within. Its why ""Clockwork Orange"" is so important.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","

"The Dark Knight","AJ4F","27 January 2009","Good movies should create ""the willing suspension of disbelief,"" meaning you forget that it's just actors and special effects. This movie failed to deliver that for me. I kept waiting for it to match the review hype but it only had random moments.The Eastwood/Devil voice of Batman needed explanation. It was too far off from his regular voice, like a crank caller. Was it just assumed to be an identity trick? It was hard to work up empathy for either Wayne or Batman. The best acting I've seen from C.B. was in ""The Machinist"" (a far more disturbing and better film than this).Excessive lesions on C.B. and M.G. were distracting in close-ups but that's not unique to this film. M.G. isn't what I would call hot, and it's unclear how she got to be the object of rich desires. She added a dowdy effect that dampened the felt urgency of certain things.Many special effects went beyond fantasy. Vehicle mass defied inertia laws in crashes; like the Bionic Man pushing a building. The bat-cycle was ludicrous in how it could blast every obstacle out of its way. The cellphone sonar was logistically absurd, if even technically possible. I like special effects with some chance of realism. The half face, half sinew thing was well done, but the sudden meanness of the D.A. seemed forced.I found the opening bank scene the most engrossing, promising part. The guy on the street corner dangling the mask had a spookiness I was expecting from the rest of the film, but it washed out. Where was all the ""darkness"" reviewers wrote of? I guess he kept kid audiences in mind. The Joker was well done but no more menacing than random creeps interrogated on C.S.I.Most importantly, the plot didn't feel naturally driven by events (see title of review). I think a rare combination of hype and the death of H.L. carried this film to a higher status than it deserved.","

"The Dark Knight","pfgpowell-1","24 April 2009","It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all.","

"The Dark Knight","fallyhag","16 December 2008","Not a great Batman film fan because of the past films turning it into a dark farce, but I thought I would give this more serious one a go. At the start I quite enjoyed it. I like Bale and I liked the serious way of filming it where gravity did exist and the characters weren't capable of doing really stupid things, like Spiderman.But it wasn't long before the story got a bit daft. A lot was happening that just started to ignore common sense. The story line just started to go anywhere as long as it got to the next part of the story. You constantly find yourself watching thinking ""but that wouldn't happen"".... Yeah its Batman, but when the story gets silly just to meet the outcome...well I kinda gave up on it.The story was very...well...confusing. It kept jumping around trying to be all twisty and clever but it just made me feel aggravated. The scene jumping got madder and madder as time went on...and on...and on....I soon found myself busting for the toilet, which got me wondering how long have I been watching this film for? This film is so bloated it is ridiculous. I kept thinking this next build up was the end...but then it just carried on. There are so many false horizons in this film it is unbelievable. This was one of those VERY rare times when I just wanted the film to end...I was begging it to end.Hard to sum this one up, as all I wanted for it to do...was end. I stopped paying attention to the countless stupid attempts at a story twist...I just didn't care. From what I remember it was a shallow storyline that I just didn't buy into.Now for my real moan...the high rating this film has on IMDb....evidence of more ratings corruption on this website. You used to be able to trust these film ratings but it appears that the marketing departments know exactly how to exaggerate these figures...which I find very annoying. IMDb...do something about this or risk losing your loyal visitors to this once highly regarded website.Would I recommend this film....NO...too long and not worth the sore bum.","

"The Dark Knight","mstomaso","30 July 2008","Frank Miller's The Dark Knight was one of the greatest comic series ever made. I was a young comic book collector when it first came out and I remember buying 5 copies a couple of days after its release and then watching it sell out in a few weeks. The price for the first edition sky-rocketed after just a couple of months to over $100, as second and third runs were printed. What Miller did was nothing short of revolutionary. He depicted the Batman much the same way as the original 1930s Batman comics did - as a nearly maniacal, shadowy vigilante who sets forth to strike fear into the hearts of villains throughout Gotham. But he deepened the internal conflicts, the personal relationships, and the psychological aspects of the stories - especially the 2-3 episodes that dealt with the Joker. Miller's Joker was the flip-side of the Batman. An entirely sociopathic force for chaos and evil - and not entirely unlike the Batman at a deep structural level - driven by a similar kind of megalomania. The commonalities between the characters were just enough to shake Bruce Wayne to his core and to cause him to question everything he stood for.Take note - With Iron Man and this film, Comic Book Films Have finally begun to realize their full potential. Thankfully, The Dark Knight took aspects of Miller's version of the Joker and brought them to the screen faithfully - with adequate but not overbearing special effects, great acting talent, and a script worthy of Miller's work. The Joker, devastatingly played by Heath Ledger, is not the quirky Cesar Romero prankster, nor the slightly demonic Jack Nicholson Commodore of Crime, but rather Frank Miller's ingenious, amoral, homicidal maniac. And he is anything but funny. The Joker reigns terror down on Gotham through a series of increasingly murderous experiments designed to test his nihilistic hypothesis concerning human nature. The Batman is being hunted by a righteous new district attorney for his vigilante approach to justice, and it is becoming increasingly clear that crime has stepped up its skill and intelligence to meet him at his own level. Bruce Wayne, plagued by personal difficulties and the deep conflicts of his dual life considers hanging up his cloak just when Gotham needs him most. But something about the Joker gets way under his skin.The film even captures Miller's dark aesthetic of Gotham and the Batman consistently. Ledger is perfect, Bale is very good (though he was not given the depth afforded the Joker by the script, the story dictates that this will change in the next film), and the excellent, star-studded, supporting cast makes this blockbuster worth seeing by just about anybody. For those who know the story and bring great expectations to this film - you will be rewarded with catharsis. For those who don't - prepare to see something you would never expect from a comic book based film - intense psychological drama and powerfully realized characterization.For those who are just looking for a fun and entertaining action film - you will get more than you bargained for in The Dark Knight, but may find it too lengthy and dark for your tastes.","

However, I never got to see it, until today. And, after seeing it, I can affirm that it is a contender to be one of the best films in history. There is no criticizable point. Heath Ledger's performance is one of the best performances ever given on the big screen, and even the secondary characters shine. The city has a tone of horror, suffering and fear, just as someone would imagine Gotham, and all this thanks to the excellent setting that this feature film presents, both in terms of the scenery and the music, composed by the famous Hans Zimmer. Last but not least is the plot, and I can firmly say that it is one of the best I have ever heard in my life. I still can't assimilate how well the Joker's plans are made, worthy of a crazy but charismatic and cunning villain.In conclusion: 10/10.","

"The Dark Knight","jpschapira","17 July 2008","""The Dark Knight"" is a movie that honors its title. Dark, twisted and complex, Christopher Nolan's latest wonder concerning Batman is a movie that sets a before and after in its genre and joins its perfect companion; its predecessor ""Batman Begins"". It had been a long time since I had seen so much adrenaline on a screen, but then again Nolan's Batman is what it is because it isn't just about the adrenaline. It's still daylight in Gotham when a masterful opening sequence (supported by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer-again-magical score) gives way for a robbery to take place; organized by a man who calls himself The Joker (Heath Ledger), someone we would instantly take as a villain. If normally villains don't call themselves villains in superhero movies, this one says a lot of things about himself. He loves to talk and share his life philosophy with everyone he meets; he likes to joke, of course; he likes to watch people suffer with or without him watching; he dislikes rules and he likes Batman.This last statement maybe more understood once you've watched the film, but there's one of Bruce Wayne (yes, Christian Bale IS Batman) many interesting conversations with Alfred (Michael Caine) in which they discuss the nature of The Joker, and the old man points out that maybe Bruce doesn't understand this villain in particular. There will be a moment of confrontation later in which the villain will tell the superhero: ""You complete me"". That phrase reminded me of the great movie ""Unbreakable"" is. But, actually, what is a hero and what is a villain? In Nolan's brilliant screenplay (written with his brother Jonathan, a usual collaborator), full of psychological insight, this is one of the issues that floats over our head as we get lost in the ever exciting action sequences, fights and things blowing up in Nathan Crowley's spectacular production design. ""It's not what underlies you, but what you do that defines you"", a Rachel Dawes now played truthfully by Maggie Gyllenhaal told Bruce in ""Batman Begins"". Her words resonate, as Batman continues to fight evil with her, Gordon (Gary Oldman) and a new ally, the D.A. Harvey Dent (a superb Aaron Eckhart). Let's not forget that Batman is more human than any of the other superheroes of the comic books. In this film, he's never able to call himself a hero and he thinks of quitting; without knowing if he's the guardian the city needs or deserves. But in all this realness, to continue watching him fall, to see him using his gadgets and his vehicles as a pro, to see that intelligence may surpass a gun to win a little fight or to generate fire without the need of any explosive; is one of ""The Dark Knight's"" treats to the viewer. Another major treat for the viewer is the presence of a villain (or criminal, if you prefer, as The Joker refers to himself when he says the town ""deserves a better kind of criminal""-again the issue of deserving someone or not; a villain or a hero-) that equals Batman in human qualities. I don't mean that The Joker has principles we may admire (although many people will find inspiring things in his weirdness), I'm simply referring to the fact that he doesn't fly through the air or owns magic powers and he just uses what he has in hand to serve some kind of purpose. Heath Ledger steals the film (and will get an Oscar nomination, because dreaming has no cost) and makes a wonderful Joker, mainly, because he embraces this human aspect of the character Christian Bale understood so well in ""Batman Begins"". Without overacting, Ledger creates an individual that we can call a freak, because it's the first thing that crosses our mind when we meet him. He has all this makeup in his face and two scars; he has a lot of stories to explain the origin of these scars. Ledger tells every story convincingly, and leaves no room for the viewer to fully understand him. His character has no name, nor he possesses the background story we see many times with heroes and villains; however we get to perceive an amount of grimness in his look and we want to know exactly where it comes from. It's Heath Ledger's great acting what generates all this.The rest of the ensemble, as in ""Batman Begins"", is top-notch. Michael Caine is given more screen time and makes the best of it; so does the great Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman. There are surely many other perspectives in which the film can be viewed and discussed, and that reflects the very good piece Nolan has created; a movie that's profound in the best sense of the wordA word we don't use so much for comic book movies.AnywayBatman may not know if he's the protector Gotham needs or deserves, but ""The Dark Knight"" is undoubtedly the superhero movie the film-goer deserves and has been waiting for since its predecessor; a film that even someone who knows nothing about comics, like me, celebrates with a big smileWhy so serious?","

"The Dark Knight","merrywood","25 July 2008","Amidst the clamor there might always be a dissenting voice with a different perspective and one who climbed up to the top of the high risers to view this production perhaps a few dozen yards above the gargoyle-like, statuesque Caped Crusader.Here, banter about the nature of a criminal mind and sweeping sky flights and explosions replace story values and depth. Continuity is sacrificed for action. An over the top performance wild enough to be suspected for dope fueling by a now beloved, dead actor keynotes the scenario and etches deep into the psyche deep enough to be indelible and appears to bring glory to what is really an overblown, contrived production.Extreme cruelty and sadistic enterprise replace plot and hammer away the chain of promises of the story. Where in Batman Begins we had a fascinating account and worthy characterizations we now have unsupported, unfounded surprises with gaps in character development. The personality dysfunction is so extreme as to press painfully against the science of psychology and the logic of common sense.What is it that drives the audiences and critics so wild about this production where the budget soared to almost $200 million? In the annals of film history we were uplifted by life affirming values, the motives of true heroes and were rewarded by story somehow easing a small aspect of our tedious, sometimes painful, boring lives. Instead we now are treated to the Circus Maximus, the Flavian Amphitheater, blood, gore, and easy, cheap death. The film theater critics rave and drool. Bob Kane simply turns, uncomfortably in his grave.","

The Dark Knight combines great direction, with brilliant acting, and beautiful cinematography to create a film that transcends it genres and becomes a great film. This will remain a perfect example of why film is still worth shooting in, why practical effects should not be a thing of the past, and why the Oscars should pay attention to comic book films as they can be art in their own right. It serves as a comic book film, but also a tragedy of Shakespearean quality, with one of the best villains of the last 20 years. On top of that Christopher Nolan's unflinching faith in practical effects creates a truly realistic and beautiful experience.","

"The Dark Knight","warthogjump","26 March 2011","Quite simply ""Dark Knight"" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a ""proper"" superhero movie, so let's forget about that).Batman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't ""just"" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of ""dark"" and of perception of ""society."" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not. Secondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these ""abilities"" about him which are soooo unrealistic. So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable. The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!I won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!Everything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special. It's cool It's original It's awesomeI can't believe how it wasn't nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman, the guy plays a different person in every movie, I can never tell its him","

"The Dark Knight","kenjha","3 May 2009","Although an average film, ""Batman Begins"" had a dark, brooding quality and got off to an interesting start about the origins of the caped crusader before turning dreary. Unfortunately, this followup takes up right where the previous one left off - still dark but also dreary and even sillier. The script is atrocious and the plot line involving Two-Face is unbelievably lame. The most interesting thing in this tiresome film is the mesmerizing farewell performance from Ledger. He is simply fun to watch as the Joker. All the other actors look bored, a result of Nolan's dull direction. At a length of two and a half hours, it seriously overstays its welcome. Time to make ""Batman Ends.""","

The Direction and acting are amazing but the plot is bad. The plot is outrageous as though the joker could accomplish even part is insane even for the comics. The phone call scene .. are u f..ing kidding me It's so outlandish that it's annoying. And the ferries !!! Common. I know it's a fantasy but the whole ""social experiment "" is so stupid. Arggg I hate this film. Nolan does an amazing job but honestly Burton runs laps on you. The vision and plot are sub par to the point of annoyance. I know everyone loved this film but honestly it's bad.really bad. Hard pass.","

"The Dark Knight","Cosmoeticadotcom","29 July 2009","Yawn.A few years ago, despite repeated critical praise and entreaties from friends and colleagues, I gave up on ever wasting my precious time on earth watching another Steven Spielberg film. Time and again I was told, by others, 'No, this time I really mean it, it's a GREAT film,' and time and again I would leave the theater angry or nauseous. But, now I am at the point where I feel the same way about ALL Hollywood tripe. As with the Spielberg crapfests, I was told how wonderful excrement like Brokeback Mountain and Crash were. They weren't. Similarly, almost all the reviews of The Dark Knight were glowing; especially praising the performance of Heath Ledger (the cock-mumbling hero of Brokeback Mountain) as the Joker. And with his demise shortly before last year's premiere of the film, the inevitable chorus of Oscar buzz for his performance rose, with him, indeed, snagging a posthumous Best Supporting Actor nomination and win (ala James Dean). So, was this the greatest film of all time? Was Ledger's performance one for the ages?No.In fact, not even close. And, as badly hyped as the Spielberg stool has been, and as nauseating as the PC films named above were, The Dark Knight, and Ledger's performance, have to be the two most over the top unbelievably hyper-hyped things Hollywood has ever unfurled. Why? Simple. The picture barely rises above mediocre, and Ledger is nowhere near as good a Joker as Jack Nicholson was, twenty years ago, in Tim Burton's Batman.The Dark Knight simply goes on for far too long- 153 minutes- and gets worse with each passing minute. It goes from a possibly good film, in its first hour, to a barely passable one in the span of the last hour or so. A good 45 minutes could have been lopped off with no discernible detraction from the film. In ten years, few people will care about this film, and Ledger's Oscar win will go down as one of those great WTF? questions wiser generations will chuckle over. The Dark Knight is not good comic book stuff, it's not good sci fi, it's not a good action film. It's just hype.Yawn. (the sequel)","

"The Dark Knight","PipAndSqueak","12 August 2008","If I'd been sitting at the end of a row in the cinema I would have left after 30 minutes. I've sat through enough hard hitting films to know the difference between meaningful grit and wanton hatefulness. The production values in this film are so high that the 'terror' that is deliberately laid down seems genuinely possible in its evilness. The killings and explosions however do not support the supposedly 'psychological' subtext. Two men sitting either side of the same coin...or as Gotham DA's coin shows....both the same side... is not adequately developed. The story's many conflagrations and large set piece explosions cannot possibly have been set up by one man (The Joker) in any reasonable timescale - and certainly not in the one suggested in the film. The whole thing is just preposterous - it is just an exercise in slash and burn without relief. I had one hell of a headache after seeing this film - I can't have been the only one. One other patron I heard afterwards was positively spitting with rage and contempt over being made to see a film about 'some psychopathic sociopath not Batman'. Heath Ledger evidently had to do himself in in order to kill off the blasted character seeing as Batman wasn't going to.","

"The Dark Knight","Matt_Layden","18 July 2008","A new villain is in town and he's a homicidal clown known as The Joker. Batman must do everything in his power to stop him, while Harvey Dent takes the lime light as the new face of good.Not since The Matrix Reloaded have I been hyped to see a film. Where Reloaded failed to deliver on that hype, The Dark Knight soars with bright colours. Is it everything that a Batman fan wants it to be? Yes. Is it everything a film lover wants it to be? Yes. The Dark Knight takes you on a ride through action, suspense, humour and drama. It rests in a genre that makes you suspend a little reality. This is the comic book world, where there are green monsters, flying men in tights and teenagers swinging around in New York. Very bright, very over the top and very fun. The Dark Knight turns all of this on it's head and delivers a raw, realistic and genre defining film. Along with Iron Man, The Dark Knight sets a new standard for comic book adaptations.Without a doubt, every review the one will read will praise the chaotic energy that Heath Ledger gives in the role of The Joker. Can a role really live up to such hype? Yes, and this is it. Heath Ledger goes where many people do not. He becomes the character, he becomes the Joker. Nicholson played the part well, but Ledger embodies it. Every little quirk, from the flicker in the eyes, raising the eyebrows or using his tongue to wet his lips, draws you into the character. It's safe to say the Ledger does indeed steal the show from everyone and the film knows this too. It's a shame we will never see where Ledger career would have gone, because this role is juicy and Ledger nails it.That's not to say that everyone else isn't good either. Bale brings more tragedy into the heart of both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Even with the world around him crumbling down, he still stands for good. Michael Cain reaches more depths with simple looks in his eyes. Both Alfred and Fox have moral dilemmas in this film, both play them well. Oldman has more screen time here then he did in Begins and he takes the character of Gordon to new heights. We know him as a good cop that doesn't conform to the corruption, but here his range explodes into more emotional decision making. Aaron Eckhart has the most troubling task here. He must play two completely different roles, within the same character, and we have to believe the transformation. His anger and hate mixes well with his confusion in what to do after his 'accident'. Finally Gyllenhaal, replaces Holmes. The character finally has some more range, but Gyllenhaal doesn't get enough screen time to bring it to us. Again, it's sad to say but this is the weakest link. It may just simply be the character.Everything about this film hits the nail on the head. The acting is top notch, no longer are roles in comic book films cheesy or one dimensional. These character are psychotic, dangerous, funny, defenseless and everything more you can ask for. Back when these characters could never be taken seriously, now are awing us with their presence. The script is fabulous. Every line of dialogue spoken by The Joker is chilling, now times that by ten because Ledger somehow gives the lines more chills. The action sequences are entertaining. We have car chases, fight scenes, race against the clock bits and anything else The Joker can come up with. With ever scheme he tops himself in the absurdity and craziness. More action then it's predecessor, more drama, more villainous and more dark. This isn't your Adam West Batman. This is Nolan's Batman.Nolan has recreated what once was lost. When nipples and bad ice puns were where these characters were, now are set back in the right motion. Nolan has given us, not only the best Batman movie, but the best comic book movie. You don't need high theatrics to create a great comic book film, you need substance. The Dark Knight has boatloads of this. I found myself wanting more of the Joker, I was so enthralled by the character and the performance. I found myself in awe of where the film goes, in terms of plot and character development. I applaud Nolan for not making a happy go lucky film, but for given The Dark Knight his true colours. He's a tormented soul, the events in this film push him to the limit, to his breaking point.There are some minor setbacks though. I wasn't too thrilled with the bits in Hong Kong. Trims here and there could have saved the running time, which clocks in at 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes. As well as too many scene where the camera decides to spin around the characters a couple times, it gets a tad annoying.The Dark Knight will break barriers. Comic book films will be more serious, more character and plot driven then CGI laden. Heath Ledger will earn an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a sick and twisted clown. People will want to see what happens in this world and the people in it. The Dark Knight does create a new world, a world of fear and excitement. Where in some cases you kind of secretly want to root for the bad guy. This is a world I applaud, this is a film that I applaud. This is a perfect example of what a film should be.","

"The Dark Knight","JWJanneck","26 August 2008","I suppose many people might be offended by the simple suggestion that this movie could be anything less than ""the best movie ever"" or perhaps just ""the best movie of 2008"", that it was merely okay, for superhero action drivel.But to me, that's what it was. It's the old good vs evil thing, the good billionaire dons latex suit to fight the evil for no apparent reason other than that he's the good guy, and the bad guy being ridiculously-over-the-top so, with a similarly solid rationale. Then there is the another good guy who has to experience a biographical kink in the form of a girlfriend blown to pieces and some cosmetically challenging facial events, and he becomes the semi-good guy. Lots of explosions, pseudo- technology, vehicles driving above the speed limit, lots of fighting, the end.I never really understood the appeal of the Batman franchise, which turned a unremarkable set of comic books (uh, ""graphic novels"") into an unremarkable series of movies. Yet, many people seem to love it, and consequently another one of those hit the streets, bigger, better, more expensive, and this time with an IMDb rating that even made me curious.To be sure, there are many interesting and impressive aspects of the movie. The director, for one---I very much enjoyed Memento, and give Nolan a lot of credit for it. The cast of The Dark Knight is nothing short of impressive, with certified talent such as Caine, Ledger, Oldman, Bale, and Eckhardt. And, of course, the special effects are great, the fights are well-choreographed and fast-paced, the cinematography is excellent, and so on. It is, no doubt, a technically well-executed action flick, which I suppose is all that it wants to be, and probably all most of the people seeing it in the cinema expect it to be.But it is also other things. Overlong, for instance. The trivial comic-book plot does not sustain 150 minutes of interest, its self-indulgent repetitiveness becoming boring quickly, the little character development happening in cartoonish hit-you-over-the-head-with-hamfisted-symbolism style, the rest being fights, battles, destruction, and some more fights. The range of excellent actors that make up the cast remains woefully underused, although we do get so see some excellent acting, most notably from Ledger and Oldman. Ledger's Joker, in particular, does not require a very broad range, but it's far out in the crazy and psychopathic part of the spectrum, and Ledger manages to turn a fairly ridiculous and cartoonish villain into a three-dimensional and utterly creepy character, which is testimony to his acting ability. By and large, however, one does get the feeling that performance per talent ratio isn't a very good one, and that this crowd could have been put to better use in a more grown-up production with less of a focus on expensive action sequences.Overall, this movie is way over-hyped for what it is, it's not among the top ten movies of all time in my book, but then neither is ""Shawshank Redemption"" or ""The Empire Strikes Back"". It does have its moments, though, but it could easily be cut down to 90 minutes.","

"The Dark Knight","ShiiStyle","7 August 2008","I know people will hate me for giving this movie 2 stars, but allow me to explain why the rating is deserved. I watched this movie twice and my initial impression of it was confirmed on the second viewing. The tagline of the movie is ""Welcome to a world without rules."" But even someone who likes the movie must realize this is absurd, because the rules of the film are strictly defined from the start. Batman is PERFECT GOOD, and the Joker is PERFECT EVIL. Whenever it's the cops versus Batman in this movie, we know the cops are wrong and Batman is on the side of good. He's just that good. And the Joker is so evil that he doesn't even have a motive. He's there to create a force of perfect chaos which Batman is duty-bound to fight.To deny that this movie is about terrorism is to deny the well-executed thrill elements such as the videos released to the press and closed-circle moral tests (on the ferries; similar to United 93). These are borrowed directly from the terrorist playbook, and one persistent element, the ticking time-bomb scenario which Batman solves by brutally beating people up until he gets the information he wants, is derived from our fear of terrorism even though ticking time-bombs NEVER happen in real life. When you compare the movie to reality, though, an outrageous discrepancy is made evident. Terrorists are not born psychopaths like the Joker. They are poor, scared people driven to violence only by persistent reinforcement of hatred and duty. That's WHY there are no ticking time-bombs: true psychopaths do not act like the Joker, and terrorists are not true psychopaths.In this movie, the only mistake Batman makes is when he injures himself swerving his motorcycle so that he doesn't kill the Joker. He is just too good to kill his enemy. Three thousand years of storytellers are laughing themselves to tears in Heaven at our image of a hero. Read Shakespeare. Read the Iliad. See if you can figure out for yourself what kind of travesty this is.The areas where this film deviates from standard superhero crap only condemn it further. Batman creates a magical cell phone network, which his buddy says a violation of privacy; the film makes his buddy out to be a spineless coward, because Batman needs his magic to do good. Do you see the problem here? Here it is: Batman doesn't exist in real life.To call this movie the best film of the year, or, as IMDb currently reckons it, the best film of all time, is to admit that we want to believe in a world where good battles evil. It creates a worldview where ""good"" people will not have to admit their own problems, and ""evil"" people can be rounded up and beaten half to death without any moral qualms. It is EXACTLY this kind of mentality which has caused the war in Iraq, Abu Ghraib, and Guantanamo Bay.I award this movie eight stars for execution, but subtract five stars for its incorrect, dehumanizing, and morally stunted outlook on human nature. Thus, it ends up with three stars, which I think is more than generous.","

"The Dark Knight","The_Dead_See","26 July 2008","It's hard to say that the Dark Knight is a bad movie. After all, it's well acted, well directed, and deals with some heavyweight, complex social and ethical issues.Problem is... is that what you really wanted to see? A drama? A deadpan, straight-faced, humourless, mostly action-free drama? I like dramas... I really do. Some of my favourite movies fall under the drama umbrella - Shawshank, Shine, Goodwill Hunting, Once were warriors, American History X, The Assassination of Jesse James, Ondskan...But lets be honest with ourselves shall we? We're sitting in the theatre watching a movie about a billionaire vigilante in a caped bat costume fighting a green-haired clown. How much drama/realism can you truly inject into that mix before you lose any and all sense of good entertainment? Sadly, not this much. And I'm at a complete loss as to how this movie got such a high IMDb rating (9.4 at the time of writing). The only thing I can speculate is that an entire new generation of over-enthusiastic, and apparently very easily-pleased, youngsters just reached movie-going age and skewed the results. Go figure.","

"The Dark Knight","tastyhotdogs","15 August 2008","So Dean and I headed to Forest Hill Weds night to watch ""The Dark Knight"". Here's my controversial review.I'd been waiting to see this for a while, mostly because of how good ""Batman Begins"" was but also because of the rave reviews of Heath Ledger's performance, apparently his best since ""10 Things I Hate About You"". Went in expecting a truly classic cinematic performance...and i gotta say i was disappointed.The film starts out with a gripping bank robbery, done by some blokes in Joker masks. I got all excited when i saw William Fichtner as the bank manager who looked like he was going to foil the robbery, but alas his impact was minimal and he was soon dead. After his performance in ""Go"", he shouldn't be taking crummy roles like that. Anyway we're soon shown the power and craziness of the Joker and his desire to be Gotham's master criminal. Yep, the Joker is chilling but in what will be an unpopular opinion, I reckon you could have put Screech from ""Saved By The Bell"" in that make up, with those lines, and be about 80% as terrified. We're then introduced to Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart, in his best role since ""Double Jeopardy"") , the District Attorney with no fear and free from any ounce of corruption and Gordon (Gary Oldman, in his finest role since ""Air Force One""), the squeaky clean cop who is hell-bent on bringing down the city's crime. The Joker realises he must take down Dent,Gordon, as well as Batman to take the city over and hatches a brilliant plan to do so. Will he succeed? See it to find out.Now it was an OK movie, but way way over-hyped eg it's listed as No.3 on IMDb.com's all time best movie list. That puts it ahead of some pretty well known and respected movies ie Pulp Fiction, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Casablanca, Psycho and Taxi Driver just to name a few. I thought it was a decent script, with an excellent cast, but the film just got to clever for itself at times, or at least for a Batman movie. Having said that I missed one or two key moments of the movie, probably due to agitation more than anything else ie that Gordon was driving the van with Dent in the back. I just thought it was weird that the driver wasn't talking and must have been a baddie. It was way too long, at least by 30mins and didn't have enough Bruce Wayne time.Solid, but I still prefer Batman Begins. Some will love it, some may think it was a tad overdone.FInally, ledger's performance was good but let's not get carried away and put it up with DeNiro as Travis Bickle, Al Pacino as ""Scarface"", Anthony Hopkins as ""Hannibal"" or Keanu Reeves as ""Johnny Utah"".","

"The Dark Knight","lizziebeth-1","3 January 2009","Sigh. Christopher Nolan almost got it right with the right franchise (Batman represents the hunted hero allegory for the male human condition well). Unfortunately, the franchise rebootism, the gross overuse of computer generated imagery (CGI), plus the film's graphic novel vs live action antagonism, for me, became highly problematic.I asked myself just when did I drop out of the movie? -Well, 11 minutes in. By then there were already too many issues with Nolan's juggernaut. Here are some of them:1) the many filmic reboots irritating our story concept,2) the prologue brazenly ripping off Yves Simoneau's 2003 TV docudrama ""44 Minutes:The_North_Hollywood_Shoot-Out"" (without acknowledgement),3) wasting William Fichtner in a nothing role,4) too many red herrings of the ridiculous faux ""Batdudes"",5) Batman's ridiculous audio-""soured"" voice,6) ""Lieutenant"" Gordon's similarly audio-""soured"" voice in the vault (why?) on ""we'd have to hit all the banks simultaneously...""And all this in the first 11mins!!Soon we're hit with the disingenuous tangent about Commissioner Gordon aimed at the ignorant in the audience. Everyone who knows this franchise expression will never accept ""Lieutenant"" Gordon's untimely death...but it's enough to turn us against the screenwriter! This is called ""ratcheting the plot"", aka ""yanking the audience's chain"".There's a lot more where this came from.TDK, as an early superhero film, suffers from graphic novel vs live action antagonism. It can be hard to show the impossible realistically, and when the allegory goes too far, we're back in disbelief.During the transportation scene with Harvey Dent (Eckhart), both the suspicious cabin crew action and the over-the-top ""SLAUGHTER"" graffiti on the attacking rig just makes us lose patience with the film's dropped police procedural tone.Christopher Nolan raised the bar for Batman, but just not far enough, so TDK seems to undermine its own new standard. Computer generated imagery (CGI) certainly can be a trap like catnip to many directors, but its use actually controls the tone of a film. So if you decided to make Two-Face's closeups show his skinless CG-musculature for shock value, then you deserve flak for making your film too ""schlocky"".More examples of wrong tonal balance:7) The dinner scene debating Batman's role in a democracy is admirable, but its execution is mired in table hubbub between two couples. The gravitas is lost in the shuffle.8) Bruce Wayne's awful speech pillorying Harvey Dent undermines our faith in Bruce as well. His venom was so unnecessary that he actually tries to undo the effect for Rachel Dawes (doesn't Gyllenhaal's replacement of Katie Holmes again smack of rebootism?).9) Harvey/Gordon's prisoners in the traffic snarl deserved more screen-time. The battle of wills with The Joker represents the film's ""Prisoner's Dilemma"" so the audience needed to emotionally be with the ferry scene already.10) Two-Face was too cartoonish/rabid for live action, even in context. Harvey is depicted as having been so well-adjusted prior that the overwrought burning and accidental loss of his fiancée simply doesn't justify his later violence. His dementing rings utterly false. Without showing more of his back-story, it's irresponsible to either kill the character or turn him so deeply and irrevocably psychotic, all in one film.11) Dent's hospital-room screaming is implausible: he shouldn't have enough strength to roar at Gordon, let alone been allowed by ER doctors to reject tissue grafts! Deeply, deeply ridiculous. Moreover, how can he talk properly with ONLY half of his mouth missing lips? His entire CGI facial concept just for the sake of CGI remains completely implausible. It's a fundamental break with the film's pretence at live action. How can we suspend our disbelief? Perhaps by all of us turning into 8yr old boys... and there now appear to be billions of 'em.12A) Such deep burn victims never have clean muscle afterwards anyway, so why wasn't Dent's CGI face just mottled flesh? Well, to stick to the gross graphic novel design concept for all the 8yr old boys: schlock on steroids.12B) Dent's skeletal musculature CGI is even wrong within the Batman mythos. There was no plotted reason for the deep burn at all, since Batman was rescuing Dent from the flames. Why is Two-Face so gross? Again, over-indulgence of CGI to ""deliver the schlock"", long computed by studios as mandated together with sci-fi.13) The interrogation cell scene was annoying directorial self-indulgence. It was darkened outrageously during Gordon's interrogation just for the Batman reveal. Completely implausible, it relies on Nolan controlling ""the fourth wall"" (the audience's POV). Overripe, ridiculous, and insulting to the audience.TDK(2008) does make several great points, but I'll let others expound on that. For me, it's sufficient to sing the 8yr old Bart Simpsons parody: ""Jingle bells, Batman smells, Robin ran away""...","

"The Dark Knight","theskulI42","28 July 2008","When the Joker showed up at Wayne's fundraiser for Harvey Dent, my tentative rating was at an 8.5. I was thoroughly enjoying myself, and was having it go mano-a-mano with my all-time favorite superhero movie, Spider-Man 2. By the time Batman swerved around the Joker on his motorcycle, I was getting a little restless, a 7.5 maybe, and set the score around 7.5 or so; still liked the film, and was pleased that at least I was going to give it a positive grade, to spare myself the hassle. By the time Harvey Dent was chillin' in a warehouse with ol' Jim, I was rooting for Batman to die if only to end the film more quickly.There is a good film in here. Hell, there's a GREAT film in here, but my god, to humanize this film is to implore it to do a few crunches. The Dark Knight is hideously, mindbogglingly, monstrously overlong. Every source physical and electronic had informed me that the time FLEW by that it may have lasted two hours and thirty-two minutes, but it sure as hell didn't feel like it. Well, they're right. It DIDN'T feel like two hours and thirty-two minutes. It felt like three. By the time Dent got his faced burned, I was glad that it was finally wrapping up, because it had gone on a bit too long at that point. The HOUR that it spent unnecessarily wrapping up plot strands after that scene was what killed the film for me.There was definitely a lot to like here. In a superhero film, the constant is the hero, the variable, and thus, the definition of quality, is in the villain. The Joker is the best of the Batman villains because he's the most colorful, and yet the most terrifyingly plausible. He embodies things we fear on a fundamental level: People who hide their identity,in masks and grotesque makeup, who are unhinged, who can and will do anything on a whim. Where other villains include a poof who tells riddles and a man raised by penguins sewer (don't worry about correcting me if I got that wrong, I don't care), the Joker seems horrifyingly impervious to scrutiny.In the acting department, I had surprisingly little problem with Bale. He seemed less brooding and more personable, more lively than I had seen him. When he put on his scaaawy voice, my entire theater chuckled, but I understood what he was trying to do; it far more real and acceptable than before. As for the rest of the cast, Ledger did a good job, but by the halfway point, I grew tired of the film treating him as an go-to gag machine. The longer we sat with him, I saw him descend from Jerry Brudos into Jerry Lewis. People seem to overestimate the difficulty in playing a crazy person. Talk with a funny voice, affect a little walk, invent a couple of mannerisms, it's really all in the definition. The entire film, I was thinking: You know who could have been fabulous at this role? Andy Dick. Seriously, Ledger's put-on voice sounded almost exactly like Dick's normal voice, and there's a built-in hatred for the man anyway, what better way to immediately cultivate a visceral audience reaction? I think he could have done a fine job. Aaron Eckhart, on the other hand, was quite poor. He had the chiseled chin, and I know the man can act, but here he just seemed out of his element. Far too often, I saw Aaron Eckhart acting when I should have seen Harvey Dent speaking. As for positives, I thought Maggie Gyllenhall was a tremendous upgrade on Katie Holmes. She infused the character with dimensions and life, and she convinced me every second she was on screen. Michael Caine also did a fine job, and I want to give a mention to Eric Roberts, who I thought stained the screen with the sleaze emitting from his body in his meager calls to set. Most of the rest of the cast had little to do, although I was still lamenting that, as good as job as he did on the good side, possibly the great go-to villain actor of the last generation will never be given a chance to enliven a Batman villain.Batman Begins, which I gave a 6/10, ran 2:20. I don't remember feeling it was overlong, just sort of lame. While, The Dark Knight is as far from lame as you can get, but that other problem reared its ugly had and caused me far more pain that the immediate fizzle of its predecessor, because it had so much going for it, and it seemed to have squandered it with a wasted hour that did NOTHING NEW for the characters. Did anything that important happen in the final hour of the film that hadn't happened at least once beforehand? And every new thing they did introduced was so labored and obvious that it was just as much of a time waster as everything else.The word, more than any other, that I want to use for my opinion towards this film is ""lament"". I wanted to LOVE this film, to be greeted with open arms by my electronic peers into their cool, hip club that apparently numbers in the billions. And my initiation was all set. Bruce, Chris & I had passed several hurdles, several tests, on our way to being accepted together, hand-in-hand, brothers in arms. But like Harvey Dent's infamous coin, the game was rigged. They flipped it until we failed, and fall flat on our faces we did. Or at least, I did. We took part in a five-legged race, and they persevered while I got stuck with the shackles, and that's too bad. The finish line was in site, but they kept moving it back, and all I taste is dirt.{Grade: 6.25/10 (C+) / #16 (of 60) of 2008}","

"The Dark Knight","airfoyle","12 January 2009","I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst.","

"The Dark Knight","pc95","28 August 2008","My expectation for Batman: The Dark Knight, the 2nd of the newer, sleeker installments was probably a little high mostly due to the word of mouth of co-workers/friends calling it better than/ as good as Batman Begins. Unfortunately I didn't think so. There is an awful lot of jockeying and expository dialog - too much - testing my patience. The media reported ""Oscar-Worthy"" performance by Ledger, while good, is not fantastic. He is only sporadically on the screen. It follows, the movie I think suffers from the film-makers trying to develop several story lines at once. The Joker should've been focused on more - (spoiler) instead we have the Joker, love triangle weirdness, and Harvey Dent villain development. Also, what is with Christian Bale's raspy (I'm masking my voice) line delivery when in the suit - detracting and awful. A fan of the original 89 movie, I'd also like to add both of the lead females in these newer Batman movies really don't bring the class and presence of Basinger from the original - they are the girl next door - Gyllanthal is a good actress but is not a fit in this movie imo (maybe even less so than Holmes in Batman Begins),... anyway.....,Interlaced were a great locale skyline/scene in Hong Kong, and about 2/3 of the way through a superior chase scene delivering (spoiler!) the most exhilarating moment technically in the movie - the tank transformation. There was some great final dialog by the Joker delivered to Batman too - For me these were badly needed elements, but few between. Also we have a less interesting/less imaginative crises - (spoiler) bomb hostages vs. weird kooky interesting hallucinogen idea in Begins. I was hoping for more ""wow"" moments, but instead got more hand-to-hand combat and rapid-fire expository dialog - ho-hum - Some editing and recasting could've done this movie some good. Mixed review, with several entertaining scenes trying to break out of the mold....","

"The Dark Knight","jfmvp","22 July 2008","** PLOT SPOILERS EVERYWHERE ** Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is one of the better films in the history of its genre, however, it does not qualify as a masterpiece. In fact, it's quite far from such a distinction. It falls short of unquestionable excellence because of a ridiculously high number of plot holes, most of which regard The Joker and his criminal exploits.It is a given that Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker leaves us with a character who is thoughtful, unpredictable, ruthless, unrelenting, and arguably insane. That is to say, some inconsistencies in the villain should be accepted, if not embraced. But others, to be frank, are unacceptable because of their stupidity. For example: In the film's opening sequence, a clever bank heist spearheaded by The Joker, the crazed clown kills off his partners as the caper progresses. At the time, it made sense. Pretty simple, the more colleagues he kills off, the more money that leaves for him. But later on in the film, The Joker burns his half of the criminal underworld's combined fortune. He makes it overtly clear that he is not motivated by money. Not in the least bit.So why was the money a factor in the opening scene? It shouldn't have been. Uneven scripting there.But that's nitpicking in comparison to the film's greater faults. The ultimate reason why ""The Dark Knight"" falls short of the masterpiece label is because there is absolutely no way, under any circumstances, at any time, on any planet or in any solar system, that The Joker could execute so many complex plans in such a short period of time.OK, here is where people start saying: ""But it's a movie! It doesn't have to be possible."" I know, thanks. I agree, it doesn't have to be possible. But, and this is a huge BUT, a film as ambitious and lengthy as ""The Dark Knight"" wants to be taken seriously. Not only does it want to be taken seriously, I think director Christopher Nolan wants Oscar consideration for the work he has put in here, and cast members have been saying regularly that they don't want this to be considered as a mere ""superhero movie,"" or ""action movie."" Well if you want to elevate to the level of serious drama, then you have to explain a few things to me.(1) How does The Joker continue to find willing participants in his escapades when all of his previous crew members end up dead or in jail? The guys he's finding to work for him have to be true idiots. Totally brainless. And that doesn't work because The Joker's plans are meticulous and require precise timing and execution. If these goons are dumb enough to work for him, they aren't smart enough to be effective as help. It's a perpetual contradiction throughout the film, particularly the second act.(2) Sure The Joker is swift and tricky, but c'mon, he doesn't exactly look like a normal citizen. If city-wide security has been heightened to a level never before seen, how the hell is this maniac with a painted face and wacky hair not being spotted? Does he have an invisible transportation machine or something? He doesn't have supernatural powers, so he shouldn't have a supernatural aura.(3) When did he have the time to wire the hospital with bombs? Even if one of his goons did it, how did no one in the hospital notice suspicious activity? What about the assassination attempt on the Mayor? The other cops on the firing line didn't notice the most infamous villain in the city standing right next to them? Why? Because he crouched over a little and tried not to make eye contact with them? Please. I could go on for days, too many plot liberties were taken.I'd actually like to discuss the performances a bit. I think the separation between the strongest part and the rest of the cast is the largest ever with an ensemble of this size and magnitude. Meaning, Heath Ledger's performance was far and away the best in this film, better to the point where it bothered me that no one else was in his realm. The scenes where Ledger was off screen lacked the magnetism and intrigue of the ones in which he appeared. Although appeared is probably not the best word, more like dominated. Christian Bale was OK as Batman, but he's almost too stoic for a character with such strong morals and opinions. He's also a little bit stiff when he's in playboy mode as Bruce Wayne. I think his performance in ""The Prestige"" was more emotional, effective, and polished.Aaron Eckhart was all right as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, but the problem was that the vast majority of the time I was seeing Eckhart on screen, not Dent. The same Eckhart we saw in ""Thank You For Smoking."" Also, a man with a finely tuned social philosophy, like Dent, would not totally flip his ideology after the loss of a close loved one. Hopefully the angle is that the toxin causing the disfigurement messed more with his brain than we were led on to believe.Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were believable as always, but of course they are underused as Alfred and Lucius Fox. Gary Oldman probably contributed the second strongest performance in the film as Commissioner Gordon, and Maggie Gyllenhaal (as Rachel Dawes) was a step up from Katie Holmes as far as execution and timing -- but that's not saying much. I really could go on for days about the unacceptable plot liberties, but I'll spare you. All in all, I liked the film because it had some thought-provoking sequences involving moral dilemmas and intriguing societal questions, and in having such ""The Dark Knight"" succeeded in escaping the ""superhero movie"" label. But it's not a masterpiece.Plain and simply, it has too many holes.","

"The Dark Knight","dglink","18 July 2008","Finally, a super-hero film for adults. Avoiding the cartoon-style exploits of such super-heroes as Superman and Spiderman, director Christopher Nolan has fashioned a sophisticated, but hugely entertaining, take on the equally impressive Batman. ""The Dark Knight"" is witty, intelligent, and fast paced. The action scenes and effects are spectacular, but do not dominate or overwhelm the film. Nolan does not linger over gratuitous explosions and lengthy chases. When a scene has communicated its purpose, he wisely moves on. Despite the film's 2½ hour running time, the movie seems tight and has little excess.Although Batman has no Robin, he is surrounded by a fine group of villains and supporters. Michael Caine underplays the quasi-butler, but delivers some amusing lines, and Morgan Freeman is solid and reassuring as another of Bruce Wayne's employees. Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman ably hold up the public servant side of the equation, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is fine as Rachel Dawes, although few demands were made on her talents. In the central role, Christian Bale is a fine Bruce Wayne/Batman. His icy-perfect face and pumped-up body are physically all that a Batman should be. Yet beneath the glossy exterior, he manages to breathe life into the crusading vigilante. Then, of course, there is the late Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger's performance steals every scene that he is in. Behind a crude childish makeup, he is at once demented, evil, funny, and over-the-top entertaining. However, even when he is delivering a humorous line, the villainous edge remains. When Ledger flicks his tongue, plays with his hands, or rolls his eyes, he captures the audience and holds them with his magic.Future super-hero films undoubtedly will be measured against ""The Dark Knight."" From Batman's stylish costume, his motorcycle, and the Batmobile to the dark, glistening cinematography, the stylish art direction, and the state-of-the-art special effects, the film rarely falters. With a sterling cast and a gifted director, ""The Dark Knight"" sets a new standard for summer action flicks. At last, a comic-book super-hero film that will not only grab the key pre-teen male audience, but also bring in discerning adults who may never have read a comic book or attended a movie in the summer. Way to go, Batman.","

"The Dark Knight","ericjg623","21 February 2013","The trick to these comic book superhero movies is not to take the source material too seriously. That's what made the original Batman from the 1980's, with Jack Nickolson as the Joker, work so well; everything about that movie, including all the main characters, was over the top, and rightfully so. We are, after all, talking about a man who goes out and fights crime while dressed up as a bat. How seriously, really, are we supposed to take such a notion? But this movie (among its various other flaws) takes itself WAY too seriously. It's supposed to be some deep, even epic, tale of, well, something. But, hey, if I want that, I could read Homer. Or Shakespeare. Or watch ""The Godfather"". Stories that truly are epic, in no small part because they feature real human characters, not ones that came out of a cartoon book.That said, I can only review so much of this movie because, quite honestly, I don't remember all that much from it. Nothing about it truly stood out in my mind, other than that the general theme seemed to be to inflict upon the audience several scenes of considerable cruelty and sadism. And, unlike in other movies where these qualities played a significant role (Silence of the Lambs, Apocalypse Now), here these elements seem to exist solely for shock value, not because they actually add anything to our deeper understanding of the story.Which brings us to the character of the Joker. Let me be blunt - Nickolson's Joker was at least ten times better than this one. Both are completely unbelievable, but Jack's Joker was at least interesting, even fun. He was a pleasure to watch in much the same way that a good James Bond villain is. But there is nothing pleasurable at all about Heath Ledger's Joker. First off, he is so psychotic that he couldn't function anywhere outside of an insane asylum; he kills off his own henchmen, burns their stolen money before their very eyes, yet this psycho somehow enlists a small army of loyal followers without giving them any reason to be loyal at all, and yet, despite being a complete walking mental meltdown, he manages to put in motion any number of very detailed terrorist plots that would require the exact opposite mindset, namely, one of cold and calculating rationality. In short, as a movie villain, he simply fails. Not only is he not credible at all, his sole contribution to the story is to add the aforementioned cruelty and sadism, making this not only a stupid and unbelievable movie, but a thoroughly depressing one as well. I mean, seriously. If you want to see movie characters who have a dark, twisted, and sadistic streak and yet come off as credible on the screen, one need look no further than such persons as Tommy from ""Goodfellas"" or Luca Brasi from ""The Godfather"". But the Joker from this film is just a void. Encountering his character was like stepping on a dog turd. The experience is wholly unpleasant and disgusting, but thankfully you forget about it pretty soon.3/10","

"The Dark Knight","Groverdox","10 November 2020","Yeah, it sucks to add another movie to the list of things everyone else likes but me, but here we are. I have, however, heard some of the people who raved about this movie when it came out since retract their comments and say it wasn't as good as they remembered, though I don't know if they were as underwhelmed the second time as I was.The first time I watched this movie I just didn't really get it, but I resolved to watch it again, knowing from its stellar reception that I must have missed something. Well, I finally gave it another go, after watching ""The Dark Knight Rises"", and I don't think there was anything to miss. There's a lot going on in this movie, though nothing I really cared about. As with ""Rises"", Batman is hardly in it, but that feels like a good thing because his raspy voice is stupid, as is the way he looks in his costume.Is Heath Ledger's Joker the most praised performance in the history of cinema? I wasn't around for Marlon Brando in ""On the Waterfront"" or Peter O'Toole in ""Lawrence of Arabia"", but people were raving about Joker as though he invented acting with his characterisation. Hard for that not to be a let-down, though the performance is memorable, recalling less a super-villain than someone like Hannibal Lecter.The movie has few, if any, memorable scenes, and not much about it makes sense. The fact that all you ever heard about it was about Ledger's performance might lead to surprise when you find out that Two-Face was also in it, but he is.I wish I knew why this was supposed to be so great.","

"The Dark Knight","cultfilmfan","19 August 2008","The Dark Knight is based upon the Batman characters created by Bob Kane and is a follow up to 2005's Batman Begins. I remember in some earlier reviews of mine this year that I stated that I didn't even know if I would end up going to see The Dark Knight. After giving Batman Begins a perfect rating on this site you are probably wondering why I wouldn't want to see a sequel to a film I enjoyed so much. Well, when I saw Batman Begins in the theatres I thought it had a lot of style, action and kept me compelled and entertained and I found it a really good time at the movies. Hence the perfect review I gave it three years ago. Then, I saw it again on DVD and I did not like it at all. The thrills and excitement were gone and everything that held up so well the first time had vanished and rather than seeing all the good things I enjoyed about it on my first viewing, instead on my second viewing I found parts of it boring and I started to have a few problems with the acting performances. I still kept the rating on this site to a 10 because that was my first initial reaction to the film, but after not enjoying the film much at all seeing it a second time and having been entirely sick and tired of all the superhero films coming out this year I really couldn't have cared less if I saw The Dark Knight at all. Then all of the really good reviews for the film came pouring in all over the internet and I kept hearing how dark and bleak this version was and I even heard of one critic who couldn't recommend the film because of how dark it was. This intrigued me because I have always been a fan of darker fare and the fact that family members saw the film and told me that I would really like it ended up in me seeing it. And to my surprise I thought it was as close to perfect as a superhero film could possibly get and I would most certainly call it a masterpiece. The acting was all top notch from every performer involved especially by the late Heath Ledger who played the role of the Joker. I have seen Heath Ledger in other films such as Brokeback Mountain, or I'm Not There and to play this role he isn't more or less playing himself, but instead going totally out of character and playing a twisted and menacing psychopath and everything the Joker says, does and the evil in his facial expressions show that he is a true terrorizing evil. All of this is perfected by Heath Ledger who gives the best performance of this year so far and I would compare his performance as the Joker to last year's best performance of Daniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood. Day Lewis won an Oscar this year, so I see no reason why Heath Ledger couldn't get nominated, or even win the award in his memory seeing as he tragically passed away earlier in the spring. His performance was one of the best parts of the film. What was also so good about the film besides the top notch acting, direction and cinematography was it's story. Instead of being filled by non stop explosions, high tech gadgets and over blown self indulgent special effects, this film instead mostly focused on the characters and for each one involved we are driven deep into their minds to see the madness of the villains and the good and also troubled lives of the others including Batman himself. The character study here is so fascinating that anyone taking a sociology or psychology course couldn't help, but be interested. The story in the film had me drawn in from start to finish and I liked the menacing and dark tone to the film which I found all the more interesting and I liked how this film did not use formulas, or clichés and instead gave us a straight out story that you would not know how it ended till the end credits rolled. The Dark Knight really hit me and made an impression on me. Even days after leaving the theatre I 'am still thinking about the film and certain scenes and characters in it. This is what I call a powerful, thought provoking and stay with you film that is so good that it has almost a power to remain in your mind like this. The Dark Knight is a brilliant achievement and I will go as far to say that it is the best superhero film I have ever seen simply because it is not like other superhero movies and this is also the best mainstream film of the year so far and I hope it is not shunned come Oscar time.","

"The Dark Knight","cafesmitty","20 July 2008","This is the first movie sense The Lord of the Rings movies that had mad, crazy, super hype and surpassed it. I thought it was getting hyped up for the wrong reasons (the tragedy). I had my doubts going into this film because everyone was talking about the Ledger. After seeing so many previews, after seeing the film and knowing what other films the actor was in, he NAILED the Joker.I was happy that the film had more to offer than the preview had shown. It had some unexpected moments (which was good) and everyone one, and I do mean, everyone to include the bit players were wonderful in this movie. Nolan commanded and got some of the best work out of these people. Christian Bale just cemented that he is either better but no less than at the same level as Keaton's Batman and in the way, director Nolan film is better because it's more raw than Tim Burton's Batman. It doesn't seem like some faraway city. Kudos also goes to the City of Chicago for allowing Nolan to do whatever he wanted, so we have a lot less blue screen (cgi) effects and more realistic action sequences.But the man of the hour, is Heath Ledger. Like in so many movies where the villain steals the movie, this is no exception. You can see and sense the insanity in Ledger's Joker. I mean Jack Nicholson played Jack in the first Batman, but who would have expected this demented performance out of Ledger. And it was a great performance without the over the top, maniacal campiness that actors tend to do when playing villains.Now the only thing I wasn't crazy about was Batman's voice, it sounded a bit fake and it was hard to hear at times because it was so low. But that didn't take ANYTHING at all, away from the movie. This is a must to see on the big screen. I think its a must to see on the big screen twice and it's a must purchase on blu-ray when it's release. The movie runs about 2 hours and 45 minutes so be sure to take your bathroom break before the film start because you will not want to miss a minute.Director/Writer Christopher Nolan has that special film makers touch. He screwed with out Heads with Memento. He dazzled us with The Presitge (another movie with Bale in it). He reinvigorated us with Batman Begins and now he stuns us with the well-crafted ""Dark Knight"". We all seen what could happen to a franchise in the hands of a lesser director (Batman Returns, Batman and Robin) and its nice to see something that takes your breath away. The Dark Knight will win lots of awards, but I think it already won the biggest, audience approval. Thumbs up for the Dark Knight.","

"The Dark Knight","PWNYCNY","8 August 2008","Is it finally over? Did the movie finally end? This movie proves the following: NEVER make a movie with comic book characters that is longer than two hours. Even most Shakespearean plays aren't that long. NEVER make a movie that is somber, morose and convoluted. NEVER have the good guy act like a bad guy (here Batman is just as nasty as the guys he's going after). NEVER have the leading lady play a support role. NEVER have lead actors play support roles unless they are no longer leading actors (superstars Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are in support roles). NEVER have Batman without Robin. Christian Bale is no Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman is no Neil Hamilton. This movie needed ... cried out for ... Batwoman (remember Julie Newmar?) ... and Frank Gorshin, Burgess Meredith and Cesar Romero, and, yes, even Burt Ward and Adam West. This pretentious movie is not bad but it certainly is not great. The one bright spot in this otherwise somber production is the performance by the late Heath Ledger. His performance as the Joker almost carries this otherwise lackluster version of the Batman story. Batman is a hero and to portray him as being anything else does not work. Dark Knight is the Doctor Zhivago of Batman movies - long, pretentious, drawn out, somber, and above all, dull.A few words about Heath Ledger. Mr. Ledger was a great actor and proved it in Dark Knight. Despite the movie's flaws, his performance is practically flawless as he brings a unique interpretation of a sinister and complex character to the screen. Whenever Mr. Ledger was in a scene, the movie improved and became interesting. Mr. Ledger gave a great performance for which he deserves a BRAVO!Also, during the filming of Dark Knight, one of the stunt men, Conway Wickcliffe also passed away. Although not a movie star, the loss of Mr. Wickcliffe should be duly noted. From the extra in the crowd to the featured star, every member of the cast and crew play a critical role in bringing a story to the screen ... or the stage. The amount of planning and work involved in producing a movie or staging a play is almost indescribable and without the efforts of EVERY member of the cast and crew, the entertainment brought to public in the movie houses and theaters would not be possible.This movie reportedly is a box office smash hit, but when viewed today the theater was practically empty and after watching this movie, now I know why. After all, if you want to take a nap why pay good money to fall asleep while watching the Dark Knight?","

"The Dark Knight","deproduction","20 July 2008","Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend, the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so... this film is a step-above the standard summer blockbuster. However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from cliché, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good.","

"The Dark Knight","Zombie-Kermit","15 July 2008","And that word is Awefantaculous. I use that word because words like ""awesome"" and ""fantastic"" are thrown around way too much. This movie deserves better. Almost everything about it was perfect. I will try to give away as little about the plot as possible, because to take away anything from this experience would be disastrous. Let me just say that I was not in the least disappointed with the plot, it delivered in as many ways as seemingly possible. It improves on Begins in almost every way. What you have seen in the trailers doesn't compare to what the movie delivers. heard complaints about the run time, but that was absolutely no problem for me. Every minute of the movie was great, and I didn't think any of it was unnecessary at all. In fact the only real problem I had with the movie was the dread of knowing that the movie had to end some time. The movie was the perfect mix of the human side and the action side. It goes so much deeper than the battle against good and evil.The acting was at the top of the ranks. Christian Bale has once again proved that he is made for the role of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal served as a great replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both played their roles just as good as before, which is all anyone can really ask, is it not? I think Gary Oldman was even better as Gordan than he was in Batman Begins. Harvey Dent was played really well by Aaron Eckhart, as well. But I guess in the end what people want to know is about is how the late Heath Ledger played the Joker, easily my favourite Batman villain, and maybe my favourite villain of all. Well, he was perfect. I feel that the role will go down in history as one of the greatest villainous portrayals of all time. Give him the Academy Award and any other awards that he could possibly qualify for. Hell, invent a new category just for him. He was The Joker. May he rest in peace.I loved the way the film was shot, whether it was the hotel scenes, the scenes of Gotham City and especially the action scenes in the movie, which I felt was another improvement made on Batman Begins. I guess you could say it was a lot more fun, since a common complaint about Begins was the lack of that. I thought the blue colour scheme of Gotham was really great. The movie also had some great wit throughout it, which rarely seemed cheesy or out of place. The score was really something as well. It is probably one of my favourite ones around. One of the best things about the film, for me, was just how dark the movie was. If Batman Begins pushed Batman and Robin to the back of your mind, then The Dark Knight will be the movie that pushes it out. The film was made to really let The Joker be what he was truly meant to be, without restraint. I am amazed that it got away with the PG-13 rating (even though I'm an Aussie, and don't have that rating system). The costumes and make-up in the movie were, big surprise, just great. I thought The Joker's makeup was really cool, because it didn't just take the easy way out and make it perfect throughout the movie. They went into detail with it. Batman's new suit was also pretty cool.I guess in the end, all I can really say that I loved this movie, and I think it would be hard for someone to be disappointed with it. Christopher Nolan really came through big time, and made a massive improvement over the already great Batman Begins. This is clearly a franchise that fits him like a glove. It is suspenseful, emotional, action packed and really everything else I think people could hope for. A problem with the movie is that after seeing it, you may just be a little spoiled. Because it is at a level of awefantaculousness that is pretty rarely seen in movies. Believe the hype. This is way more than a Batman movie or a summer blockbuster, it is just incredible.","

Goyer - these guys are in their primes here. Not that the same isn't true of some of the actors involved in this film, Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart.It's hard for me to do a review on this film and certainly the character of the late Heath Ledger is one of the greatest villains in cinema history. He is played to perfection. Perfect would even be putting it mildly. Ledger is so great in this film that all the awards and recognition he has received from around the world are too little.Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Gary Oldman are all super, but the one who shines brightest out of the entire cast with the exception of Ledger is Aaron Eckhart and his character, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Christopher Nolan's hidden ace. A perfect addition to the film's story.The action scenes are OK, the sound is good, the film is generally very good technically and is far from the most successful in the genre, but the acting, the pacing and the story itself make The Dark Knight (2008) the giant that it is.I recommend it along with the other two installments in the series, ""Batman Begins"" (2005), and the not-so-good ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012).Final score: 9/10.","

"The Dark Knight","BA_Harrison","29 July 2012","8.9 out of 10—really? The Dark Knight is undeniably visually impressive, full of flashy special effects, stunning production design and spectacular action set-pieces, but the fans who have rated this film so highly clearly have as little grip on reality as its antagonist The Joker (Heath Ledger).152 minutes of relentlessly dark, dreary, depressing drama—the enjoyment factor turned down to the lowest possible setting—this overly complex and frequently logic-free sequel to Batman Begins sees director Christopher Nolan once again presenting the antics of a man dressed as a bat in a completely humourless fashion. And if Nolan is going to take matters so seriously, then so am I...Could a man with half his face burned off really get out of bed the next day to conduct a vendetta? Why does Batman talk to Fox in his 'gruff' voice when the man already knows his real identity? How do you get hundreds of barrels of explosives onto two ferries without being noticed? Likewise, how did The Joker wire up a hospital to blow-up without being spotted? Who built Batman's underground silo? Does anyone really know what the hell was going on during that scene with that cell phone sonar equipment and the building full of baddies? Where exactly do you hire a butler who can arrange for a skyhook in Hong Kong? These are just a few of the many questions that arise from Nolan's so-called masterpiece.Rabid Batman/Nolan fans might be all too happy to overlook these somewhat awkward posers, but I can't—not when such a blatantly flawed film currently sits at No.8 in the IMDb top 250.5.5 out of 10, but not good enough to be rounded up to a 6.","

"The Dark Knight","eric262003","16 June 2009","The main highlights of this dismal, dark isolated atmospheric superhero adventure movie is the Joker's (Heath Ledger) appearances the climactic special effects like the explosions and the believable dark clouds that surround this dreary, but riveting blockbuster. According to demographics, the majority of the audience who went to see ""The Dark Knight"" are 85% males between 18-35 who's minds are fixated on video games. And that is a non-surprising statistic.With the exception of Ledger's stunning performance, this movie fails to carry out its promise in gathering our interest in watching the good usurp the forces of evil, almost to the point where we take more sympathy for the evil Joker than the dark hero himself, Batman(Christian Bale).Bruce Wayne comes on to me as philandering playboy and his portrayal is thinner than a Ritz cracker. His envy and rage over the new female D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is more juvenile in personality without any sign of emotion at all. Even when they embrace in that fatal kiss, it's more manipulative than inspiring. Batman's robotic voice and stoic expressions convinces the audience into thinking, is that a man or a cyborg? This pedestrian performance may give the audience the impression that this movie was never meant for adults to watch. The anger and rage manifested in the Joker's soul has some spark of appeal and sorrow, but the schtick eventually become monotonous after a while that it becomes tiring after a while. The final scenes in the movie has very little excitement that afterwords people started to slowly trickle out of the cinema disappointed because of the set-up. It was just pure banal.Though it's not the worst movie in the world, it's still very over-rated in the end. The real standout was the Clown Prince of Evil himself the Joker. But even he couldn't save this movie himself. He wasn't getting any real help from his co-stars. But if you are those who just want to watch the movies just to see Heath Ledger one last time? Well the more power to you, but you really shouldn't do that on account of someone's unfortunate premature death.","

"The Dark Knight","OllieSuave-007","7 September 2012","I know there were a lot of hype and excitement about this film, but I think it's the weakest in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. Though it does have some strong movie elements such as good special effects, high drama and a haunting music score, this film is too dark even for Batman. The plot drags, action and violence are overkill and some of the cast performances were weak.As a fan of the comics, I was hoping that this trilogy would follow the comic continuity more than the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher series. But, it wasn't meant to be.We have a story about Batman trying to rid the city of the remaining mobs, but ended up facing a new villain, the Joker. Later on in the story, crime-fighting Harvey Dent flips a nerve and turn into Two-Face. While pretty good acting, Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was too manic and sadistic. I didn't care for the make-up and costume as well. Aaron Eckhart's performance of Harvey Dent/Two-Face drove me off the wall - bland as Harvey Dent and much too angry as Two-Face. I know Director Nolan wanted to avoid camp at all cost after what we've went through with Schumacher's films, but the story is too serious and dark. I would highly recommend ""Batman Begins"" or ""The Dark Knight Rises"" over this. While also dark, those two films had much better character development, compelling plots and a better balance of humor.Grade D+","

"The Dark Knight","crustysaltmerchant","7 October 2008","Forget all the hype of it being the best film ever and it being the best film of 2008 and Heath Ledger being fantastic. None of these things are true. Yes the film is good, bordering on very good. But that's it, no way is it as great as everyone is making out. Let's start at the beginning the story, the story is just not involving enough, there's a power struggle between gangsters and Batman/the police, the Joker offers to kill Batman in exchange for half the gangsters money. The end. That's it? that's the whole story? Yeah, OK we have the relationship angle with Rachel and Harvey and Bruce but seriously what a ridiculously dull storyline. The action is good without ever being exciting or involving, personally I didn't care how many anonymous henchmen Batman fought with or how many faceless extras were put in danger by the Joker. This film needed a major face off between the two and that just didn't happen. As for Heath Ledger's performance, the characters name is called the Joker, clue is in the title, he just wasn't funny. I can't remember a single wisecrack in the whole film. Joe Pesci in Goodfellas is the perfect template of how to play the Joker - likable, hilarious with a serious threat of explosive violence. Heath just wandered about looking like a mad goth grumbling in a Richard Nixon voice. As for Harvey two face what really was the point in introducing him right at the very end of the film? a total waste of a character. Overall I feel slightly cheated by this film. It's not the fantastic movie I was expecting, it's an above average sequel. Nor is it up there with THE great superhero films Superman - The Movie and Superman 2, Spiderman and Spiderman 2. These are great superhero films, these set the benchmark way above whatever this can reach. An enjoyable film but not worthy of it's overblown status.","

"The Dark Knight","ezzeldin-z7","26 September 2019","The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time. From its exhilarating first frame to it's bittersweet last, among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil.
Nolan's constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight, then, isn't a message but a sensation, which comes from the deliberately twisted form, you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down.
To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas.
It's not just the best Batman film ever. It's not just the best superhero movie ever. It's more than a money-spinner, a franchise, a comic-book cash-in. The Dark Knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it.","

"The Dark Knight","k_g_barreto","7 January 2020","It surprises me that 12 years has passed since this film was released, and no other film of the super-hero genre have surpassed this one in terms of quality. Not one of the MCU, neither of the DCEU. Of course, we had great super-heroes films, but the Dark Knight have something else. I think it's the philosophical part. Not trying to be 'deep' or play the smart one, it's just the part that captivated me the most. The idea of Batman being the 'ugly hero', the monologue of Gordon in the ending of the film is outstanding and one of the reason I love Batman. Joker, that is heavily based on the version of the graphic novel Killing Joke of Alan Moore. The agent of chaos and anarchy that have a twisted vision of the world. The 'madness is like gravity' phrase have the same concept of this quote of The Killing Joke ""All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day."" Of course there's more than that, I loved Harvey Dent, Joker's 'social experiment' moment is just so powerful. The concept of a hero defeating the villain not with punchs and kicks, but proving that his view of world and ideology are both wrong, is just fantastic and I knew Christopher Nolan wouldn't gave us less than that.About the rest, that makes this film even more interesting. Of course Nolan's directing, he's not that good at action sequences, but nothing you can't ignore. The amazing soundtrack of Hans Zimmer, his music brings the build-up necessary to increase the tension and adds more emotions to the film's most memorable moments. There's much more things that makes this film so great, but the charm is without doubt Heath Ledger's acting, a groundbreaking perfomance, he steals every scene he's in, he's charismatic, even portraying a sociopath, his laugh, the mannerisms, everything about his character is great. One of the few comic book films that are a masterpiece, but if they all were this good, gems like this film wouldn't as relevant as it is.","

OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Can't see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be.You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. It's a better film than this. I'm not saying it's not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....This may be the best Batman film we've seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesn't move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasn't a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather. The direction - better than Sergio Leone? The film hasn't been hyped that much, so where is this coming from?","

"The Dark Knight","skay_baltimore","8 October 2008","1. This movie at least attempted to be more than just a glorified cartoon -- by focusing on some exquisite moral choices/dilemmas, beauty/ugliness, loyalty/betrayal, etc. That is its main strength, IMO.2. This movie -- as others have pointed out already -- has SO MANY plot inconsistencies/totally unrealistic sequences (even for a fantasy flick), it falls BELOW cartoon-like in that regard. That is its main -- and most annoying -- weakness.As far as the acting goes -- the Joker clearly stole the show. But the problems weren't really with the acting -- they were with the totally unrealistic way the plot evolved. Way too many subplots; not enough glue holding the whole thing together.You have to give the director credit for trying to create something of epic proportions, but you also have to hold him accountable for failing to deliver on that potential.","

"The Dark Knight","agmoldham","14 August 2008","I think those media representatives from the film company can pat themselves on the back for the job they've done with the Dark Knight. The hype surrounding the film has been fever pitch for several months. The furore on IMDb to get the film to be number 1 is a prime example.This is the second instalment of the latest Batman franchise. The sad death of Heath Ledger has led to a clamour for an Oscar for his portrayal of the Joker. Whilst it may be the best acting performance of the film I personally think his previous work was much more rounded and deserving of Oscar recognition.The Dark Knight is a classic summer blockbuster ... all action, but not quite enough substance. I personally enjoyed the first instalment more, as this focused rather more on Bruce Wayne. It seems his Batman really needs to go and see the doctor this time because that voice sounds very bad.It would have been a much better film if one of the set pieces was dropped in place of adding some depth to the characters, but I'm sure a lot of the people who loved the film would violently disagree on that point. This is definitely a film for the adrenalin junkies.","

"The Dark Knight","brian_r_wright","13 August 2008","Back to the movie, clearly the actors are first rate and the dialog is entertaining. I particularly enjoy the incarnation of The Joker by Heath Ledger, which may bring Heath a posthumous Oscar nod; the writers give him some clever lines... like the ""you complete me"" phrase in the above quote (from Jerry MaGuire). But you know what I'm not buying? I'm not buying that this Batman flick, because of it's dark humor, is better than other comic-book-inspired movies; aside from the rare Joker line, nothing in this movie is humorous, dark or otherwise. In fact it's uncommonly depressing. I suppose Knight is similar to the later Spider Man films, in which we're to solemnly consider the deep emotional conflicts presented to a post-pubescent boy who has been given superhuman powers.My friends, these are movies (and movie advocates) that take themselves way too seriously. ...For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2008","

"The Dark Knight","dtucker86","19 July 2008","I don't think I have ever seen a movie that has gotten as much hype as this one. I don't think even the 1989 Batman got as much publicity. Too much pre-hype can really hurt a film, I give Snakes On A Plane as an example. I saw it today and wanted to set down my observations. Yes it is a good film with a lot of action. I grew up watching the Adam West Batman, light hearted and campy. The title of this movie is accurate, they do make him as a dark night who has almost as much inner torments and demons as the villains he pursues! He has just not let the darkness overwhelm him. Like everyone else, I was saddened by Heath Ledger's tragic death and I think that might be one of the reasons for the raves about his performance, people see it with their hearts instead of their heads. The truth of the matter is that yes he does give a good turn as the Joker. He brought his considerable talent to the role and truly made it his own. However, he did not for one moment make me forget Jack Nicholson! That was one part Jack was born to play and Ledger was real gutsy to even try, but he didn't come close. Ledger was good but there is only one Jack Nicholson and he is the best. Sorry Heath, have fun in Heaven though.","

"The Dark Knight","cosmorados","10 September 2008","Gotham is cleaning its act up, Batman is a successful crime fighting Legend, Jim Gordon is moving up the ranks and Harvey Dent is a tour-de-force for the city as its high flying District Attorney. Nothing can go wrong, can it? Well that it is except for a lunatic criminal called the Joker decides to bring chaos to Gotham, Batman is faced with a criminal who will stop at nothing to make a point and is seemingly always one step ahead of the Dark Knight, will he cross the line and kill to stop the madman and make Gotham safe, and will Bruce Wayne get to hang up his cape and get the happiness he deserves.After Batman Begins the scene was set for a bigger and better film to follow and after hearing all the hype I felt that this film could not fail ...I was very wrong. There are a number of issues that I had with the film that I have yet to hear a good defence for. The great films may not be liked by everyone for bizarre reasons but their criticisms are usually swept aside by the faithful. There are far too many errors in this film for it to pass such tests. I will address them one at a time, as one by one these spoilt the film for me.The first is that the film drags and drags and drags. Around the time of Batman's big decision of who he gets to save seems to be the perfect time to end it, on an Empire style ending, instead it goes on and on and we have about thirty to forty minutes extra to wrap everything up that the film simply doesn't need. End it with suspense, leave me on a high, but if I'm looking at my watch you've failed.Two, the performance of Heath Ledger is not all that. Yes, he is dead and this is sad, but the Joker we get in this film is sadly not the Joker of ""The Killing Joke"" or the Joker of ""The Dark Knight"", sadly it is somewhere in-between and this version is very mish-mashy, added to that the make-up changes from scene to scene when the jokers skin is supposed to be white all the time, also the make-up should make him look like he's smiling, DO YOU GET IT WRITERS, HE IS CALLED THE JOKER. Did he laugh that often in the film, I think not, he hardly smiled at all either, what's that for? For me, the big star turn in the film is by Aaron Eckhart who is magnificent as Harvey Dent and seems to steal every scene that he is in. Eckhart cranks the film up and makes it his own, and this is what increases the rating as it does.The action sequences that are so gripping in the first film are sadly lacking here as the editing to make it a lower rating and get more bums on seats have cut the films strongest feature to shreds.The last thing that really trashes the film for me is the end sequence with the Joker's final trap, as there is little explanation of how he has done this, are we expected to believe that the Joker is magic as that is what it feels like the director is saying. I'm all for big surprises but this was just too unbelievable, and I'm saying that about a film that has a man dressing up as a giant bat! Many of the people I have spoken to claim to love the film yet so few have any defence of the errors I speak of here, many of them Jump in and agree, and sometimes even add to the list, which annoys me for two reasons, because it will mean that more rubbish will get churned out that is supposed to be good and also because people's standards by accepting sub-standard films as good are lowering and we should always, as viewers, expect more, and pace, performance, writing and even make-up should all be first rate when $170 million dollars have been spent. Maybe many people feel that because there is so much hype for a film, and so much critical acclaim that they must be wrong for not liking it, when the truth is that the people who don't like it all that much are the ones who are right and those that just suck up to the critics view are very wrong. Thankfully I have been here before and faced exactly the same backlash 14 years ago for saying I didn't enjoy ""Jurassic Park"" which had similar levels of hype and got similar levels of public favour at the time of release. I find it interesting that it is now so very far down the rankings as, upon release, it was supposed to be the best film ever, according to the critics.No film could get a reaction like this on these boards without some element of over-reaction, and in this case it's to Ledger's death, the best time to judge this film will be in a year's time when the hype has died down, and for those who can admit they made a mistake to rethink their over-hyped ratings. Disappointing.","

"The Dark Knight","pninson","3 January 2009","This movie was so wildly praised by critics and fans alike that it was hard not to have somewhat diminished expectations. It can't be *that* great, right? Right.I can't say this is a bad movie, just not a very interesting one. It begins promisingly with a superbly executed set piece, with the Joker staging a daring bank robbery. This is a very nicely done action sequence, and Heath Ledger's Joker does indeed live up to the hype. It's a genuinely strange characterization, and the story built around it should work.After that, the movie starts to drag. There are far too many long, talky sequences, followed by the usual slam-bang action scenes that are shot from a distance so you can't see what's really going on. What's really missing from the action is any sense of a story; there's just more of the same that you usually see in a superhero picture. Been there, done that.Another fatal mistake is one that happens far too often: too many villains. This was a major problem with the 90s Batman films: you have to squeeze the Penguin and Catwoman and Christopher Walken into one film, with no time left for anything like character development. In this movie, the focus is on the Joker, but that's not enough: we have Two-Face into the mix (who only becomes Two-Face at the two-hour mark, leaving only a short time for him to be dispatched by our hero).Two-Face was my favorite of the old Batman Rogues Gallery, and he deserved a story all his own. Throwing him in as an afterthought to the Joker (particularly when Ledger's scenery chewing overshadows everything else in the picture, including Batman) both makes the film far too long, and blunts its impact.Lost somewhere in all this is Batman, who almost seems absent from the picture. Although he has to make a tragic choice, there seems to be no character development, and Bale's performance is practically phoned in. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman contribute their customary gravitas, but again this just adds to the extreme length of the picture.Batman Begins was a strong picture, and I'm puzzled as to what I'm missing here. I saw this on Blu-Ray and found myself reaching for the remote every ten minutes or so, to see how much longer I was going to have to watch this. I finally hit Stop by accident at 2 hrs., but decided to just let it go. This movie failed to engage my interest on any level and I just wanted it to end.","

"The Dark Knight","CuriosityKilledShawn","4 January 2012","Three and a half years after the hype, sycophantic reviews, and mass hysteria have died down I am now ready to review this film with a level-headed opinion. Is it good. Yes, quite. Is it the icon of intelligent summer movie perfect that the fanboys proclaim it to be? No, certainly not. The Dark Knight has faults, not the least of which is the unjustifiably bloated running time.With criminals in Gotham now looking over their shoulders (or should I say to the sky) for Batman, the crime-rate is gradually falling. But when anarchic, nihilistic Joker appears to stir things up between the cops and crooks the fight against crime is cranked up to the max. The Joker is out to create as much chaos as possible, not caring for himself or others. Meanwhile District Attorney Harvey Dent tackles the criminals as honestly as he can with Rachel Dawes glassy-eyed and Bruce Wayne competing for her affections. This is spread out over 153 minutes, and in long stretches you'll begin to feel every second of it.Much of this film's running time could have been trimmed and many scenes jettisoned. I know I am not alone in admitting that a sequence midway through the film involving dead bodies in an apartment and the re-building of a shattered bullet just confuses me. The sequence seems to come out of nowhere. I know Batman is supposed to be a detective but this was just nonsense. Nolan could have come up with a better method of leading Bruce Wayne to the trap with the window and sunshade. Also, there is a moment near the end when Salvatore Marone tells Commissioner Gordon that he knows where the Joker's going to be. Nothing becomes of this.You'd have to be pretty stupid not to connect the dots when it comes to the corrupt cops who sell-out Gordon at every opportunity too. Real lazy writing there. I just couldn't get involved with Harvey Dent either. His story, struggle, and motivations did not interest me in the slightest and I found the character flat and boring. Gary Oldman as Gordon also bored me to tears. What exactly are we supposed to like about this character? With the exception of temporally faking his own death he never once proved himself to be competent. I longed for the Joker to show up and put them all out of my misery. Not much of the dialogue is memorable. It sounds as if the characters are talking out to the audience while none of the words actually gel and no eye-lines connect. Little of it feels like a realistic conversation. It's virtually all just perfectly rehearsed movie dialogue from over-written comic-book characters.I wish that Nolan would stop shying away from violence. When you watch the movie closely you'll notice you never actually see anything. The pencil trick happens fast (and off-screen), no blood effects follow gunfire, few of the punches are seen connecting. I understand the need to keep it a PG-13 but come on! Aside from a car and helicopter explosion there aren't many deaths seen occurring on screen, most of the time leaving you wondering what happened (as with Gambol's death).There are entertaining and breathtaking spectacles within The Dark Knight, but take away Bruce Wayne and the Joker and you're left with nothing at all that could identify this story or setting as something that truly belongs in the Batman universe.Like Batman Begins, it's all so straight and brick-faced. I really ought to ask Christopher Nolan ""Why so serious?""","

Over long, exceedingly tiresome and boring, one note performances, stale CGI stunts with a script that is more pretentious than portentous! Director Chris Nolan gets some marks for subtly taking the rise out of Bush and America, and convincing a very large audience they are watching Fellini, Tarantino, M. Mann and Carol Reed all rolled into one! Yes, folks, if it's dark, it must be a serious film!!!! I loved the holes in the plot(must be deliberate), when The Joker says he is an anarchist, who does not plan, but then produces several stunts that would have required Rand McNally precision and hundreds of accomplices! And please,I know he died under strange circumstances, but Heath Ledger, although not bad,is miles behind Jack Nicholson. As for the rating certificate, the British censor should be thoroughly ashamed of himself, or did he think it was just a Tom and Jerry comic cartoon?","

"The Dark Knight","Med-Jasta","28 May 2020","As a huge fan of Begins anda Batman fan in general I was very excited by this movie. I'm not really sure why this became as big a hit as it did but I was glad that everyone was onboard. The only things that initially disappointed me were things like Two Face dying and things like that because he's so important to Batman's future. But as we know now they weren't creating a Batman series, they were telling a 3 part story. That's what they did so well in these movies, take the established characters and make it their own. I was also disappointed that the heart of Begins was kinda missing. Of course Rises makes up for this making this middle chapter the action movie.Heath Ledger was a strange choice initially and everybody was mad. I trusted Nolan after Begins and of course Ledger was great. I love their take on the Joker as the criminal and the smart guy. And of course the paint and scars and doing away with the acid. Also not knowing his background is much stronger. People always act like he's this really deep and complex character and it's not. I do think his performance is a little much at times, good but could be dialed down in places.Harvey Dent was also done brilliantly. His whole story/impact on Batman is done here and in Rises. He wants to do the right thing and looses it. If there was more time I'm sure he could have come back to the good side.The story puts Batman to the test in every way. When you look back on the series he's really only Batman for 6 months. He comes back for the events in Rises but even then he's at war and not fighting crime.These movies are focused on grounding Batman. Like how the bad guy is mob/corruption and not super villains. Batman is created from Gotham needing him not his declaration that Gotham needs him. Then The Joker wears paint because of him. He would have always been a criminal but the fact that a masked man is around causes him to escalate his own look. In the movies this stuff is unprecedented, no one thinks it's normal at all.I'm not really sure how this movie became the end all be all of movies. It's my least favorite of the trilogy for sure. And while it's good I don't think it's a bench mark. I think Rises took what this movie started and did much more with it.","

"The Dark Knight","tieman64","4 August 2008","""Work in the shadows. A lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly, without any discussion, using any means at our disposal to achieve our objective."" – Dick Cheney""The more powerful the class, the more it claims not to exist, and its power is employed above all to enforce this claim."" - Guy DebordChris Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" stars Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne, a millionaire weapons contractor who moonlights as Batman, a powerful superhero who beats up terrorists. Politically, some critics believe the film to be advocating the suspension of democracy in a time of terror. Others see it as endorsing scepticism of a leader's claims to free reign during a ""state of emergency"" (which is often the leader's own creation).The truth is, the film presents the usual two-party, false binary present year after election year. Batman and politician Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) represent the opposite poles of so-called democratic politics. Batman, operating outside the law to protect the defenceless people of Gotham City, represents your typical Bush/Cheney/Nixon cryptofascist, rationalising what he does (torture, law breaking etc) for the ""good of the homeland"". Kipling called this the ""white man's burden""; men rationalise their evil as a noble and necessary burden which must be righteously carried so as to spare others the load. Dent, meanwhile, along with one Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), are idealistic, by-the-books types. Both learn to be ""pragmatic"" and collaborate with vigilantes (Batman), if only to take down bad guys. Batman, Dent thinks, has become a necessity.The film really tips its ideological hand during its Greek-tragedy final hour. Dawes, the most liberal of all the ""good guys"", dies at the hands of a terrorist called Joker (Heath Ledger), whilst the pragmatist Dent, scarred in war, abandons his ideals and embraces the Joker's ethos of chaos. In other words, we must accept the cold embrace of Batman if we want to be secure. Dent's law abiding idealism doesn't work. It's two faced and is merely a mask for chaos and disorder.The Joker, with his Al-Qaeda like video recordings, his constant attacks on ""women and children"" and his advocacy of terrorism and chaos, is a figure who stands propagandistically for ""America's enemies"". IE- America's enemies are not an oppressed and exploited, diverse and divided group trying with futility to resist in various ways, but rather, they are a fundamentally irrational, monstrous, chaotic and lawless cult of death. Thus, the Joker offers only the wild, amoral, killing life beyond the protective (and expansionist) borders of ""democracy"" (aka corporatist imperialism).The moral is as old, and as conservative, as Hobbes. The film says we can live in a wild, murderous wasteland OR a lawless, authoritarian police state. It doesn't matter which of these options the film presents as more appealing or fun, all that matters is that no other options present themselves. This false binary, rife with straw-men, is the complete opposite to something like ""Hellboy 2"", where our superheroes retire once they realise that the government for which they've been working ultimately opposes the difference and diversity they represent. Compared to ""Dark Knight"", this is genuinely radical.Late in the film, Joker places a massive bet on the assumption that most people are as viciously indifferent to other human beings as he is. The Batman's counter-bet is that people are devoted to morals, order and authority. Batman wins, an act which serves not to celebrate Gothan's morality, but to legitimise the Dark Knight.The bad guys themselves are an assortment of freaks and ethnic minorities while the good guys are, with the exception of slave boy Morgan Freeman, uptight bourgeois white Americans. The most virtuous of them is the ""Great White Hope"", Harvey Dent. Harvey, though his crusade against crime is on the legal side, secretly loves Batman's underground campaign of terror and Guantanamo Bay styled ""free reign"". In fact, Gotham police relies on Batman to break legs, smash faces, interrogate and torture on their behalf. And Batman, with enormous resources at his disposal, doesn't shirk from breaking international law to abduct a Chinese target or from erecting a colossal surveillance machine which makes Bush's extensive illegal wiretapping and water-boardings look lame. This subplot of the film is particularly insidious in light of the NSA's illegal PRISM, ECHELON and MUSCULAR surveillance programmes, ostensibly to ""stop terrorists"", but really to aid big business, spying on financial ministers, charities, leftists etc. In short, Batman is bad simply because the state can't afford to be seen being bad. What's odd is that Batman's struggle is not a collective one. The few members of the public who do try to ""copycat"" Batman's antics end up being butchered.To protect Gotham, Batman and the police eventually create serial lies and myths for public consumption. It's the ""noble lie"" which the masses need to sustain their morale. In other words, leaders (Bush, Nixon etc) are self-righteously willing to be seen as immoral, under the understanding that you understand that what they do they do, Christ-like, for you. They protect us from Joker. Of course in the real world the nature of Joker is covered up, and Batman does nothing but enhance his own material wealth and power by way of the Joker's shocks to Gotham's system. And so the ""Knight"" boils down to age old authoritarian motives: in order to have social stability you need a lie. The real hero of the film is actually the Joker, but the film's PG13 rating prevents it from dealing with this seriously. I'll take the Joker's anarchistic chaos over Batman's archaic commitment to corrupt systems of law and order any day. Not only that, Joker's psycho ramblings and burning towers of cash are infinitely more entertaining than Batman's Multi-million Dollar Extreme Warfare Batmobile.6/10 - Popcorn fascism. Despite a strong first half, ""Knight's"" second half drowns in messily shot action and needless subplots. See ""Die Hard 3"".","

"The Dark Knight","dcw-12","1 September 2008","Ledger is irresistibly interesting in his portrayal of the Joker despite the somewhat hackneyed plot, and his performance saves the film from disaster. Without his performance I would have walked out as the rest of the film was trite, melodramatic, garbage.Christian Bale gives wood a bad name as he soullessly meanders through the role. The guttural growling he performs as Batman may make sense to the plot but its almost unbearable to listen to .The previous film with Bale a beaten down outcast and a man struggling for an identity was infinitely more interesting from an acting perspective than this film. Bale feels trapped in the role in this film going through the motions and he seems bored and unchallenged almost not knowing what to do with it. The plot also doesn't have the structure of the previous film. There was a appreciable beginning, middle, and end of the previous film that let things percolate, the action build, the plot be exposed.This film is too evenly paced and like an unstructured watercolor the plot runs together and gets lost somewhere along the line.(or maybe I just lost interest) I remember seeing a scene with the Joker in a nurses costume, and while the character was interesting not knowing or caring at that point why the Joker was blowing the place up. The Two-Face character was fairly weak, the emotions in the wronged Harvey Dent seemed forced and the plot explanation of his 'do-gooder' gone wrong personality seemed ham-fisted. Maggie Gyllenhaal was not a particularly interesting character and there were no fireworks between her and either Bale or Eckhart. Michael Caine almost seemed to be biting his lips to spit out the lines in the film. He seems to be almost embarrassed to be in the film. Acting wise the highlights are Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and of course Heath Ledger who you never doubt 100% inhabit their parts and actually add something positive to the film.Unfortunately they are fighting an uneven script, a hackneyed story, and bad acting from Bale and others the whole way.The result is an uneven, and eventually uninteresting film that relies on constant action and superficial delights to offset the uneven acting and flat out bad plot. Certainly inferior to its predecessor and without Ledger would have been an outright disaster. I feel a bit alone on this analysis and I am surprised as anyone about this as I was expecting greatness when I went into the theater. But thats the way the cookie crumbles.","

"The Dark Knight","maddmaxx46","13 February 2024","This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time. Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine. It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger (RIP) was outstanding. I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker. As always, the score, the settings, and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it. I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time. 5/5 stars.","

"The Dark Knight","Faena","22 July 2008","I settled on a 5/10 for The Dark Knight. I appreciated the story structure and all the notes they hit... I just don't think they played them loudly. I don't like re-casting, and the replacement of Katie Holmes/Rachel and the original Barbara Gordon actress (yes, her too, didya notice?) is awkward and distracting. The lack of ANY blood in the film to complement the multitude of beatings and killings (to sustain a PG-13 rating) nullifies the tension that should be present in some brilliantly conceived scenarios. I didn't believe for a second that the victims of several hostage situations (mass or otherwise) would actually lose their lives, because it's blisteringly apparent from the onset that this film is a PG-13, and would never disturb its audience beyond the minimum necessary plot points. The Joker is actually underwritten. Ledger was game and his performance solid, but honestly: Throw the makeup and stringy hair on 75% of capable actors out there, and you have the same product. I think Jack Nicholson's output is ultimately more interesting, and I think that Tim Burton's original film, although imperfect, is still the most entertaining in the pantheon.I realize that to hardcore Batman fans, this is a wet dream having the grittiness of the graphic novels transposed to the big screen (if they say so; I say it came close), but riddle me this: If the same script was fashioned into a non-superhero flick, let's say Heat II, and had the same strong performances and production values, would the lack of Batman fan loyalty still rocket it to its current position on the IMDb Top 250?","

"The Dark Knight","pk-2","31 July 2008","The buzz from the entire media, and the general public made it sound like this was the second coming of Star Wars. Well it wasn't. A matter of fact, this way over hyped pile of garbage is one of the worse movies i have seen in years. Where to begin. Lets start with the so called great acting. You must be kidding me. Ledger does not deserve an Oscar nomination for this. If anything, Jack Nicholson does a far better job playing the Joker. Christian Bale basically mumbles through most of his Bat man parts, and isn't much better when he isn't. Plot is stupid as heck. They make the Joker sound like some super human beast from another world. A dozen officers with machine guns would of killed him off in 2 seconds. But i guess that would of ruined the story line. Any way you analyze this movie. Its just plain old bad.","

"The Dark Knight","mattrochman","22 March 2010","This was a pretty good film. The production quality was magnificent and Ledger's performance as the joker was magnificent.Overall, it opened strongly and for the most part, it was an engaging film with plenty of action and plot twists. However, there was something a bit ""overdone"" about the film. As another reviewer said, the ending felt as if it was built on as it was not born out of the main storyline.Second, there were too many sub-plots that distracted from the over-arching plot of the film. Similarly, there were abnormalities and things we feel are important seem to drop in and out of the storyline.Was Wayne still in love with Rachel? Was she still in love with him? Why did this fade in and out of importance? Was the joker trying to catch the batman for a share of the crime syndicate's money? Yes, no, but yes.... but ultimately no. Is Batman retiring? Yes!.... no! But why would he? Seemed the reason given was vague and confusing.What happened to the Lau? The crooked accountant snatched out of Hong Kong? The transformation of Dent's character was a bit odd and the dialogue at the end about Batman being the ""dark knight"" was a bit dumb! I did like it, but the screenplay and plotting was overdone and not enough focus was given to the primary plots. So in the end, it came off a bit scrambled. Excellent performances all round, I must say.","

"The Dark Knight","Stamp-3","12 August 2008","Anyway, I finally got round to seeing The Dark Knight and, given the overwhelming and fanatical praise the movie has engendered, a rather negative critical evaluation which pours cold water on the mass hysteria seems a bit pointless. Because what do I know? But here goes anyway!So let's confine ourselves to a couple of observations that might give the adoring fans some food for thought.The plot, whilst completely linear, and in fact, rather banal, was confusingly laid out, and not because Nolan was trying for anything enigmatic or even thought provoking; simply it was a tale not very well told. Muddying up a plot, especially one so basic, is not the mark of a clever movie, simply a poor one.The fight scenes were likewise confused and consequently rather uninvolving. And somebody must have been on a bonus to see how many shots of the back end of the ""Batcycle"" could be included in the final cut.POSSIBLE SPOILER ELEMENTPOSSIBLE SPOILER ELEMENTBut the real surprise for me was the misuse - and I think it is misuse, however deliberately it was conceived - of the central character of Batman.Batman was essentially a bystander in his own movie. He didn't really seem to do anything, other than swan off to Hong Kong, a sub plot that seemed to be taken from a another movie altogether.Harvey Dent was the protagonist of this film and The Joker the antagonist.Batman was seemingly cast adrift, totally peripheral and rather ineffective. It seemed to me that everyone's destiny was settled without much help from Batman, and even the Joker achieved pretty much what he wanted to do.I'd almost go as far to say that if the movie had done away with Batman and had been rewritten as a straight crime procedural, it would have been a better movie. Now Nolan and his buddies obviously know what they wanted to achieve, which is fair enough. I am just surprised with the impression I was left with.Still as I said at the beginning, I am really the wrong person to critique this film. I was cajoled into going and I thought, well it will probably be OK. And, being kind, that is just about what it was.","

"The Dark Knight","helmutty","19 July 2008","Actually, first of all, I can't compare Batman Begins with the Dark Knight. They have different plot. Begins shows the introduction of Batman, the origin of Batman. The Dark Knight has a more darker plus interesting plot. It is commendable. Plus bigger action pieces, the movie goes in deep with humans' feelings. It is quite good and I understand it receives a lot of positive reviews. Christopher Nolan did a good job in everything in the movie, making the story deep and dark but engrossing.The story: The Joker is trying to destroy Gotham and wants to kill Batman at first. With his trick plans, nobody even Batman can find him or predict his next move. Batman must stop the Joker from further destruction of Gotham. From there, humans' emotions slowly rise. There are some big action pieces, plot that you want to know and electronic music. I am somewhat disappointed with Two-face aka Harvey Dent, considered the white knight. I wished that Two-face will be given a bigger role. Other from that, it is hard to see any faults with the movie. Acting is good, Heath ledger makes a good joker.Overall: It is good to watch this in cinema. The runtime although long seems to pass quickly. You won't be disappointed. The first scene features bank robbing to hype the audience. It, not only shows you that it has the big action, shows the bad and good of a human which is one of the thing in the movie.","

"The Dark Knight","barberoux","5 August 2008","It is a good movie. It is not a great movie. After all of the hype I was a bit disappointed. I enjoyed the movie but thought it was just a run of the mill superhero action flick. The performances were good. All of the actors were believable and Heath Ledger's Joker was a great character but it was a one note performance. There was no real depth to the character for me. Each time he appeared he acted in the same psychotic manner but there wasn't an exploration as to why he was doing what he was doing or where he planned to take the story. The story was just a simplistic hatred of Batman and a want to unmask him. Sorry, same old, same old. Superhero movies suffer from clichéd story lines. Superman in each movie will be exposed to kryptonite. Profess his unfulfilled love for Lois Lane, (why I don't know. She is usually portrayed as some skinny, ambitious harpy), and is eventually saved from the bad guy by some babe. Spiderman yearns with unfulfilled love for his girlfriend and fights off some bad guy while reminiscing again about his Uncle, who we get to see die again. Batman will struggle with his demons while fighting off another bad guy punctuated by corrupt cops and double crosses. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a fine actress and is attractive but she is not an outstanding beauty who would attract the Joker to her in lieu of all of the other babes in the room. It is not helpful when the script has to tell you that the character is beautiful. The character's looks should tell you she is beautiful. Monique Curnen was there to provide the corrupt cop. One of many. She was wasted. Give me something new and fresh. Not a new gadget but a new story line. Explore more than the obvious. This movie was a series of vignettes of action scenes and simplistic twists. There were way too many deus ex machina moments and the twists did nothing but provide excuses for more action scenes. SPOILER ALERT. The scene with the cop being goaded by the joker to beat him up was clumsily telegraphed. Gordan appearing again at the exact opportune moment rang false. Aaron Eckhart's accident and metamorphosis into Two-face was rushed and hardly used. It became more of a distraction from the main story of the Joker. The Joker's character could have been examined in more depth. As it was the ending felt like it was there only to provide grist for the sequel. Heath Ledger's unfortunate death, which added hype to the movie, also destroyed the ending of the movie. There was no closure. It seems more like coming attractions for the next movie. Don't get me wrong it was a fun movie but it is just a summer popcorn movie and not a wondrous masterpiece it is being touted as. See it, enjoy it and then forget it until the next installment.","

"The Dark Knight","alexkolokotronis","20 July 2008","Wow. How else could I describe this movie? I was wondering how this could possibly better than Batman Begins, but the truth is it was a different type of a movie. Yet it still held those morals of righteousness, faith, ethics, responsibility and so on, it was just presented in a different way.The acting was amazing overall. Maybe not every individual performance was first rate but as a whole the cast was among the best ever. Christian Bale, who is undoubtedly the best Batman ever and probably the best superhero ever, like in Batman Begins, provides a deep and thought provoking performance. One with authenticity, validity, purity and most of all originality. His performance is subtle yet compelling, it is not by what we as a culture would like to think of as heroic but in my thinking that is exactly what it is. Unlike every other superhero he does not have superpowers. He is an intellectual who needs to rely on his and his friends' intelligence in order to do what he does. He is not an actual ""superhero"" he is a man. A man with the audacity to do what is always right even when no one else would do so. Bale throughout is able to display the turbulent lifestyle he lives in and how at times he ""The Batman"" himself has to question his own morality.The best performance of the movie though was not Bale's its Heath Ledger's. Like Bale he brings originality to a comic book character. It seems though that in every comic book movie the villains are never quite as unusual or scary as they should be. Ledger in this movie is able to pull off what repeatedly other actors have failed to do as comic book villains, give you that bone chilling feeling. Entirely throughout he brings intensity beyond intensity. His performance is so capturing and disturbing that he makes you laugh out of sheer horror, something that you rarely feel while watching a movie. The most frightening part about the way he portrays his character is not his freakishness, it's that his performance is not the least bit cartoonish, it is in fact very real. His performance is just beyond words.Aaron Eckhart was quite a surprise to me. We basically saw the rise and fall of his character Harvey Dent. The way he transformed from an incorruptible district attorney to a vengeful bloodthirsty maniac was simply perfect. Gary Oldman I was not surprised by though. I have always thought of him as a talented actor and unlike Batman Begins he is able to give a more serious portrayal of James Gordon and did as well as I expected and more. Maggie Gyllenhaal was a godsend compared to Katie Holmes. She seemed more fitting in the role of a lawyer and was able to pull off many scenes Holmes probably could not. Michael Caine is perfect for the role of Alfred. Alfred is more than a butler of Batman he is a friend, a father figure and righteous man. Who better than for Michael Caine with his great voice to portray such a character? Another actor with an even better voice is Morgan Freeman. He may not have had a large amount of screen time but he was certainly never a forgotten figure at any point in this movie.The writing was very good. Christopher and Jonathan Nolan are among the best writers currently and once again show off their talent. What is so interesting in the way that the script was written was that it did not aim to make anyone the star of the show. This script brought the best or should I say the most intriguing traits out of every character and actor. Everyone in this film had their moment to shine which was very satisfying to see. Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman all deservingly so are allowed to not just be in this movie but a part of it. Not once have I thought ""oh I wish I could have seen more of this character and less of that one"". The writing was the glue to this movie and should be given more credit.I am now much more comfortable with saying that Christopher Nolan is currently the best director. He in the past has done great movies such as Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins and The Prestige. This movie was a perfectly crafted and is probably one of the best made movies ever. He is able to do something that most directors, including the great ones, cannot do. He can keep you well engaged into a movie and still provide some sort of a deep meaning at the same time. At no point in this movie did I ever wonder what time it was or how much longer is left. That something I could say I have never done. What other director in the past has brought out depth from a superhero? The answer is no other has. He maintains an authentic feeling that you would get from watching The Godfather and still excite you like your watching Die Hard. His direction in this movie is more than special it is a monumental achievement in film.Now what do I mean by a sign of hope? It not only has its hopeful and inspiring message saying that we have the power. It says that society doesn't have to determine who we are. That is not even it though. Over the years now summer blockbusters have become mostly shallow and superficial. This maybe one of the biggest blockbusters ever but it has something that the others did not have: true, deep meaning. Hopefully this movie can be an example to the rest of Hollywood. Maybe just maybe Hollywood can do something that it has not done for years; incorporating thought provoking, deep philosophical themes consistently back into their summer blockbuster commercial movies.","

"The Dark Knight","TaylorYee94","14 March 2020","I really do not get why this movie was so sensational and why The Joker character was so attractive.
The Joker contradicts himself in many ways. He said he is not a monster, but he is. I understand he is a chaotic evil and anarchist, so people are drawn for that; however, is it really enough justification for Joker to destroy the whole city? His explanation for wrongdoing everytime he does sounds like excuse. Just blow it. Don't explain it. That's way more attractive emphasizing his 'freak'ness and chaos.
He says he's not the one with the plan, just reacting to the ones fallen to him by the good side. Gosh, is it really true? He made the plans so complicated and well-organized that his mission was all success to the level of perfection. Even when the good side thinks they win, Perfect All Mighty Joker comes in and sweeps in.
I think the director deliberately made the Joker look more powerful, shrewd, and omnipotent to blur the line between the good and the evil. However, Batman and Gordon deserve much more because the real good pretending to be evil can be a great storyline as well.
To me, it was high quality movie with director's well-planned scenario but nothing more than that. I cannot call it a masterpiece as many critics do.","

"The Dark Knight","johcafra","3 August 2008","...for, simply put, this is to comic book/graphic novel adaptations what The Godfather, Part II is to gangster movies. Relentlessly dark, brooding, tangled, mythic, disturbing, none of that alternating, and then some. Long, too. It is neither uplifting nor a place to park the kids.I devoured my share of comic books when much younger, and felt obliged but not compelled to sample their motion picture adaptations. In particular, no fan of the Batman series am I. Tim Burton aimed for weird and hit the target. Joel Schumacher aimed for Ken Russell and missed oh so wide. Christopher Nolan and company got the keys to the franchise and did something certifiably different. Hat's off for that.In sum...About a half-hour too long, and that final half-hour was action-packed befuddlement capped by not one but two unnecessary speeches that were effectively blotted out by that packed action.Heath Ledger's performance will echo in your mind for some time to come. It had to have echoed in his own. Grant the man rest.So will, or should, the performances of everyone else, most notably Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman for their respectively surprising turns of character.With age Eric Roberts looks like Willem Dafoe, and Nestor Carbonell looks unnervingly like Peter Mark Richman.I believe we're close to breaking the sound barrier of digital FX, where you don't appreciate them 'til they're hurled at you and can't appreciate them when you do.I've heard my share of edited gunshots and explosions for the year and quite possibly the next two or three. But at least the violence wasn't stylized. If I wanted that I'd rent A Clockwork Orange.What awards this film will win will be well and truly earned. All the same I can't guess where the franchise will go next. I sincerely hope it's left where it is, with the goal of applying the same considerable attention and resources to finding, learning, articulating and displaying something novel. The participants in this film are surely capable of all of that...","

"The Dark Knight","j-lacerra","18 September 2010","I rented this movie to see Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance. I endured about an hour of this dreck, and, finding nothing compelling in Ledger's work (or anyone else's), turned it off before my mind turned to jelly. Admittedly, the film is well-produced, if somewhat dark and foreboding. I would have continued watching if the film was less stilted, and took itself a bit less seriously, campy and ridiculous as the material intrinsically is. But it does not go for laughs, and therefore becomes laughable.I found Christian Bale annoying, as usual, and was surprised at just how annoying Maggie Gyllenhaal (with whom I was not familiar) came across. One word kept pummeling my consciousness as I watched: STUPID! But I guess these kinds of flicks thrive on stupid. So, despite the big budget, big names, expensive CGI, positive reviews, and all-around high production values, there is still no remedy for stupid.Miss it and save your brain cells.","

"The Dark Knight","RIK-22","15 October 2008","For a film to be 10/10, it really has to be almost perfect. I know it's all about opinions, but to get that rating it must be technically well made, you know, entertaining, good plot, special FX, acting, realism, etc. Oh and when I say realism I don't mean you cannot have superheroes or fantasy, but within the framework of the movie you have to follow its own rules. For example the Matrix was still realistic even though people could fly (it was set in a computer so it's possible). I liked the fact TDK was serious and dark, but that is where the positives end. The plot is ludicrous, as the Joker, who is a human being, is omnipresent, clairvoyant, a great hypnotist, invincible and has no human needs. I know this is a ""comic book"" movie, but when you set up a film in a normal America city, with normal physics and all that goes with it, you cannot then just make up a completely implausible story of events.The joker is beaten up, involved in car crashes, doesn't seem to sleep, yet is perfectly fine at all timesHas a vast amount of mindless, kamikaze, henchmen, who inexplicably do everything he says.The joker is able to accurately predict where everyone in Gotham will be at any time and able to somehow be in 20 places at once.No one notices the huge amounts of explosives placed in the hospital or the boats or any building in town for that matter. A man with a bomb and phone inside him is conveniently in the right place at the right time, somehow avoiding the police metal detectors or dying from his surgery.In the end the story is too unbelievable and too long as well. You don't care about anyone, as everything is too unrealistic. Therefore this film cannot ever be considered a 10/10, almost regardless of opinion. I quite liked the filming and the mood of the film, but it has too many flaws to be considered that good.I gave it a 1/10, which is too harsh, but I felt obligated to bring down the overall rating.","

"The Dark Knight","ihatespike","18 July 2008","I have enjoyed batman for a long time and despite my rabid fanaticism this movie took me to a whole new level. This is barely a superhero movie; it's utterly devoted from start to finish as an action-drama and could stand alone by all means. I admit I was skeptical of what it would be like, what with the list of villains potentially bogging down the story, the change of actress for the character Rachel Dawes and of course Heath Ledger's death which I feared might make the movie a target for his fans to run wild. However I have never been so overjoyed to be so wrong; Maggie Gylennhal is a wonderful actress as Katie Holmes' replacement; her character was good enough to avoid the melodramatic angle and was rather sublime about any of the relationships, none of the villains took away from the movie or cluttered it in the least, and Heath Ledger was absolutely fantastic as the clown prince of crime; he deserves all the praise he gets for his performance which was scary and funny at the same time. Not once did it seem that the actor was tooting his own thespian horn (as I think jack Nicholson did when he played the joker) in fact I got the feeling Ledger was determined to have fun with it and I hope he did because he made a wonderful last impression with this skeptic. You don't have to be a fan to recognize what a thrill ride this movie is; my only warning to you is that you are not in for a mindless bubble-gum superhero flick that is short and simple; this is quality cinema and batman has never had so much solid footing in this area. My hats off to all who were involved. Go watch this movie now!","

"The Dark Knight","kvineet","11 December 2023","Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is not just a superhero film; it's a cinematic spectacle that redefines the genre, setting an unparalleled standard for storytelling, character development, and technical brilliance. Released in 2008, this second installment of Nolan's Batman trilogy is a brooding, intense masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of comic book adaptations.At the core of ""The Dark Knight"" is the late Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker, a performance that stands as one of the most mesmerizing in cinematic history. Ledger's Joker is a chaotic force of nature, an embodiment of anarchy that leaves an indelible mark on Gotham City. His nuanced and chilling performance posthumously earned him an Academy Award, a testament to his dedication and the depth he brought to the character.Christian Bale, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, delivers a compelling performance, grappling not only with the physical challenges of crime-fighting but also with the moral complexities of being a symbol for justice. The film introduces Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, Gotham's charismatic district attorney, whose tragic transformation into Two-Face adds a layer of moral ambiguity that elevates the narrative.Nolan's direction is nothing short of visionary. He creates a Gotham that is gritty, realistic, and morally complex. The film's practical effects, breathtaking cinematography by Wally Pfister, and Hans Zimmer's haunting score contribute to the immersive experience. The use of IMAX cameras for key sequences, including the legendary chase scene, sets ""The Dark Knight"" apart as a technical marvel.The screenplay, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, is a labyrinth of moral dilemmas and psychological depth. It explores themes of chaos, morality, and the thin line between hero and villain. The Joker's philosophy challenges Batman's very existence, pushing the Caped Crusader to confront the darkness within himself.""The Dark Knight"" is not just a superhero film; it's a crime drama, a character study, and a gripping exploration of the human psyche. The film's pacing is relentless, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats from start to finish. Nolan's commitment to practical effects and a gripping narrative sets a benchmark that subsequent superhero films aspire to reach.In conclusion, ""The Dark Knight"" is a triumph of storytelling and filmmaking. It transcends the superhero genre, leaving an enduring impact on both cinema and popular culture. Ledger's Joker is not just a villain; he's an enigma, a force of chaos that mirrors the complexities of the human condition. ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic gem that continues to resonate, proving that even in the realm of caped crusaders, artistry and depth can coexist.","

"The Dark Knight","anthony_retford","16 January 2009","I sat down with this movie after knowing that most people loved and seemed to venerate it. But I have a lot of perspective. I was reading Batman comics back in 1957, and I have seen all of the greatest movies ever made. This just isn't one of them. I did not care about anyone. The action was remorseless and unnecessary, one could even say gratuitous. I even turned it off by the 2-hour mark because it got so maudlin and disjointed. I did read something about people voting this into fifth position of the greatest 250 movies ever made, and clearly this shows the weight of current voters who have little experience with good movies. Why, they should be asked, does Citizen Kane, a 1941 movie always rank as the best movie ever? Because it had story, wonderful acting, human nature, and on and on, all things missing from Dark Knight.Movies today are thrown together with lots of action, preposterous stories, and computer effects. Characters survive falls and bangs that would put anyone, including a linebacker for the NFL, in hospital for a week or more. As with another reviewer, I am now finding it hard to remember to much about this movie, but I can remember every scene in a great movie, like The Maltese Falcon, etc.","

"The Dark Knight","EijnarAmadeus","17 December 2008","I've just re-watched 'The Dark Knight' on Blu-Ray at home, and before pressing play I was curious if whether I would find it as brilliant as back in the cinemas. Chris Nolan's masterpiece didn't need 10 seconds before I remembered all the stuff I loved about it. The opening Batman-logo sets the atmosphere to a dark, twisted and ghoulish film that's got more character-complexity and emotional depth than any other superhero-movie before it - then again, 'The Dark Knight' isn't really a superhero-movie, it doesn't deserve being compared to the likes of Fantastic Four, Iron Man or that ""incredible"" hulk. This is a crime-epic that shows both sides of right and wrong, it's an action-paced story featuring plot-twists that gives that twirled experience of Nolan's earlier movies, like Memento or the Prestige - always capable of doing the unexpected.The performances is an ensemble of great actors, and off course, I have to give Heath Ledger all the glory he deserves for turning the Joker character into something so frightening, compelling and dark that it's instantly one of the all-time-high villains in cinema history.'The Dark Knight' is simply a great, great crime-movie that showcases Nolan as truly one of the most brilliant directors around; this is his masterpiece as Soderbergh's 'Traffic', or P.T. Anderson's 'There Will Be Blood'. Hopefully, the Academy Awards will see just how great a movie this is - it's not just a knock-out punch in cinema entertainment, but it's as muscular and arty as any action movie made to date.","

"The Dark Knight","lucianomarzo92","23 August 2009","Soon after watching the Dark Knight, I decided that it does not belong in IMDb's top 250 greatest movies of all time. It's a problem with IMDb. The minute a popular film hits the box office, what does it do? It skyrockets to the top 250. Of course, this happens because, whenever a big blockbuster first comes out, people get all hyped up about it and rate it 10 stars. They hardly ever take the time to recognize any faults that may be in the film. They just jump to conclusions to call it ""a masterpiece"" and ""best movie of the year."" Now I too had looked forward to this movie for a while. I enjoyed Batman Begins, and saw all of the other Batman films.The Dark Knight takes what was originally a cheesy comic book concept and tries to turn it into a big-budget crime thriller. It doesn't exactly make the transition. Because of this, the whole film turns out to be contradictory. At no point does the atmosphere jibe with the source material. The Dark Knight is also much too long and it isn't even that engaging. I wanted to like it but found myself wanting it to be over already halfway through. The way it is structured is also very sloppy and disjointed. It's just one outrageous scene after another. The movie doesn't have a whole lot to offer apart from a great performance from Ledger. I feel that Batman is very weak in this film as a character, especially compared his portrayal in Batman Begins. The Joker really dominates the entire film, not leaving much room for Batman's character to be developed. Batman also speaks in a growl throughout this film. Yes, I know this was intended, but it is not very menacing, nor intimidating, but quite ridiculous. And it is made worse by the fact that The Joker is main character in the movie who poses much of a threat.Christian Bale is alright as Batman in this movie, but his performance is really dwarfed by that of Heath Ledger. Morgan Freeman is great as he almost always is--best acting in the whole film (besides Heath Ledger). Maggie Gyllenhaal is average in this movie, and I found myself not sympathizing with her character at all. She's just another wooden character. Gary Oldman is alright. Michael Caine is good, but I have seen him do better. Aaron Eckhart is very competent at playing his characters (Two-face and Harvey Dent). But it is pretty unbelievable how brutal he turns out to be, compared to his cordial personality in the beginning.The Dark Knight has one very good scene (the hospital scene), in which Two-face looks at his coin and finds it has half its side burned, just like his his face. I was very impressed with this scene. In my opinion, it is the one part of the movie that has any depth or symbolism. But I found many scenes in the movie to be poorly done, including the scenes with The Joker escaping from the prison, and the scenes with Batman on the motorcycle. These scenes rely on expensive special effects to compensate for a story that isn't very compelling.Also, the scene with the two ships at the end is way too long, far-fetched, and really just a poor scene overall. The movie flows somewhat until this point, but this scene is just intrusive and irrelevant to the movie. The whole scene is very anti-climatic and interrupting. Overall, I'd say The Dark Knight is ok as far as summer blockbusters go, but that's really not saying much. For many, the movie is made watchable by a great performance by Ledger, high-end special effects, and first-rate production value, but, for this viewer, the shoddy writing ruins its chances of ever becoming great. The Dark Knight isn't so disappointing that I would ask you not to watch it; it's probably worth watching if you really like Batman. I do not ask you to side with my negative opinion of the film, as I am of the minority. However, I do ask you to not blindly fall for the hype, as so many have done, and to acknowledge the faults present in the film. Thank you.","

"The Dark Knight","Puroo","2 April 2021","I know it sounds a bit too cliché when someone says this, but this is undoubtedly one of, if not the best superhero movie ever created! It excels in every field it touches - The visual effects are done perfectly, the acting is absolutely Oscar worthy, the multiple storylines that don't seem too complex in spite of being told at the same time and in spite of being just one movie of a trilogy it managed to win the hearts of everyone who saw it.The story picks up very well from where Batman Begins ended. The post credit scene in that movie had shown Joker, and I can very well imagine how excited the audience must have been seeing it. The Batman and Joker duo is used to describe the social aspects of the society, and explain how people might behave if they are left unhinged. A hero who has his moral codes and a lot to lose, compared to a villain without any moral codes and nothing to lose yet have so much in common than what meets the normal eye. Ultimately both are seen as freaks who must be eliminated by the law.Let's talk about the characters, starting from Christian Bale's Batman. His voice sounds horrible as Batman. Nowadays many people have begun criticising it, but they don't realise that if a real Batman has to change his voice, he only has two ways of doing it - either using a voice modulator like Ben Affleck's Batman does, or deal with trying to sound different, which isn't easy when he has to breathe heavily because of how hard he works. It's just fun to see the caped crusader doing something on the screen.Next let's address Michael Caine's Alfred. He's a good representation of Alfred. Just by looking at him you get the feeling of both a butler and a guardian, something we know Alfred to be. And it can be seen very nicely when he dresses Bruce's wounds or talks to him about his crimefighting.Then we have Aaron Eckhart's Two Face. Unlike the previous iteration that was seen in Batman Forever, this one seems a lot more serious. He went through a hefty character development, from the patriotic white Knight of Gotham, Harvey Dent, to the deranged psychopath who is ready to cross all limits if he wants to have his revenge.Jim Gordon is also a much, much better iteration from what we had seen in the 1989 Batman. He actually looks like someone who is invested in his job and can contact Batman whenever he needs help. He is the kind of Gordon I imagine when I think of the animated movies. When someone mentions Jim Gordon, this is the one who comes to my mind.And finally the elephant in the room, the show stealer - Heath Ledger's Joker. Just like Two Face, Joker here has also gone through a complete makeover from what he was portrayed as in the previous movie that came in 1989. It's kinda sad that Heath Ledger never got to know how famous he has become, but his legacy shall forever live in the DC universe.The Dark Knight is one movie I often come back to just to remember these kinds of superhero movies are also possible. Every DC character should be given such movies where their character is shown to develop as time moves on. This fire should not die out.","

"The Dark Knight","cedricdumler","3 December 2023",""" You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain""Opening with a cunning master-show; a blisteringly devious bank heist that gives us the most iconic villain ever to grace the screen. A creepy Glasgow smile that keeps us up at night, spooking, haunting and endlessly projecting in our psyches for years and years, echoing from generation through generation. Everything holds up so well, in fact too well. The Dark Knight is a monolithic milestone of vigilante epicness, a hard-boiled crime noir masquerading as a PG-13 superhero movie, and a heroic ode for the ages.Clap, Clap, Clap (in Joker's manner) for Nolan's ballistic nihilism, no holds barred mannerism and his spectacular vision has bequeathed us with multiple moral time-bombs, finely-tuned characterizations and dynamically explosive set-pieces: fake Batmans sequence, Harvey vs Rachel,
18-wheeler truck spinning and flipping upside down and Joker's brazenly blasting at the Batpod and so on. The villains have largely overpowered our hero in this one as darkness triumphantly cloaks up daylight, subverting the very foundation of comic-book genre, showing something we haven't seen before.Similar to that magic pencil, The Dark Knight is relentless with its freakishly brutal power, casting an Abracadabra that's capable of knocking you out, mind-blown and ice cold on the floor. Dark and somber but equally rich in aesthetics, rainy Gotham City is as beautiful as it is immersive. So bleak there's almost no hope left and tensions are boisterously fueled by atmospheric dangers looming near, mercilessly raising the stakes up to 10000 degrees Celsius blazing fire. With many maze-like twists possessing such unpredictable nature similar to its crazy antagonist(s), this showdown is twistedly deranged, exciting and tragic in equal measures.A film, so monumental, its impact cannot be understated. A film as bold and as ever-lasting as the immortal name it so tragically tells the story of.An untouchable piece of fiction that brings great life to decades of graphic novel story-telling in unfathomably ground-breaking fashion. This is the power of undisputed directing champ Christopher Nolan.He's Not Our Hero.He's A Silent Guardian.A Watchful Protector.A Dark Knight.","

"The Dark Knight","johnmschofield","28 September 2009","I noticed that a film I had not seen was riding high in the IMDb chart and being intrigued I bought my copy of The Dark Knight. I was fairly impressed with the special effects and the acting from the cast was good and it was clear that a certain amount of care, effort and attention had been put into the films production. Ultimately though I felt as if it was a case of a fairly good attempt but no cigar. The film could have been a classic but it simply isn't good enough. Personally I was glad I had watched it but will not be rushing to watch it again and its current position in the IMDb chart is way above where it should be. It is also clear that the film has numerous enthusiastic supporters and having watched the film I can see why. I think there are a lot of people out there who have got carried away with all the hype, marketing and advertising and also I think it may be a case of its cool to say how good it is and agree with the majority. Lets just see in say five years where this film figures in the various charts that are out there. This film is not bad but its not very good either. I am not in the slightest bit bothered about swimming against the tide where this film or any other film is concerned, if its not very good I will say so but what the hey as I have said before opinion is all and I would recommend that anybody watch it at least once.","

"The Dark Knight","Ark-Flash","17 July 2008","Heath Ledger's edgy portrayal of the Joker is a frightening and macabre vision of the Clown Prince of Crime. Sure his costume is the right colours, but shades of purple and green have never looked so muted like he's been dragged through the filth of alleys and gutters. His makeup is a halloween gone wrong: applied blood red over torture scars, smudged & cracked white wash, blacken sharks eyes of death, capped by a entangled toxic green weave of hair. While his lip smacks and tongue snakes, his many quotable psycho babble tirades on chaos and madness had this preview screening audience in silent shock and awe. As fans, we wait to finally hear the Joker's maniacal laughter...we are rewarded. But it is a chilling laugh that plays on our nerves with a subliminal shrilling echo that will haunt us long after the film. His facial twitches and deliberate gestures work to induce a hypnotic and mesmerizing hold on Gotham/audience. His weapon of choice (not the lint or veg peeler) is the knife, for both it's ability to inflict a visceral cold kill and likely because it was an instrument of his own twisted grinning origin. The lack of origin story is also effective as an open book for the imagination. The hand held cam scenes of Joker 1st POV filming his prey and the off cam torture is a stark reminder of the realty of terrorist footage. From the sick punch line of his disappearing pen trick to becoming a masochistic punching bag for The Batman, Joker can certainly dish out as well as he gets. The Joker casts pure fear into the minds of Gotham by testing the citizens beliefs and moral lines of good and evil. This Mad Dog of Chaos thrives in a world without rules, where even the Good of Gotham can succumb to corruption and conflict. Hence his handiwork in the transformation of Gotham's White Knight to Harvey Two Face Dent.The eerie background ""music"" is like a deaf tone barbed-wire noise that rings through Gotham's cityscapes as a harbinger of the Joker's evil to come.In all fairness Ledger cannot be compared to Nicholson. Its Apples and Oranges. Burton's 80's film delivered a comic book to screen, thug turned clown which was hammed up with the flair and suave that's stamped with Jack's vintage trademark. Ledger has redefined the role and delivered a nightmare Monster that won't let you awake or escape. All truly memorable screen villains are able to forever get into the mind of the protagonist and audience. It is with this performance that Ledger/Joker joins the ranks of the top three cerebral cinematic killers, namely Hopkins/Lecter, Spacey/Doe.This is a tour de force Oscar worthy performance that lives up to the hype (rare thing) and even raises the bar (even rarer). So kudos to Ledger/Nolan and TDK Team for unleashing the perfect villain for The Batman. And remember, the next time you're playing a card game your hand may come up with the Joker's signature calling card. RIP HL.","

"The Dark Knight","GNickL","2 January 2009","To think that this movie belongs in the top 100 movies of all time let alone the top five is ludicrous. You bet, it' quite a spectacle. But spectacle doesn't make a great movie. There's one truly great character and everyone knows it's Heath Ledger's Joker. That was a magical paring of great writing and great acting.But what happened to the rest of the movie? Besides The Joker the film is merely almost good. That is if you like exceedingly dark and depressing movies that have little if anything to feel good about. It's mildly suspenseful at times but much of the action is telegraphed. Let's see some more stupid police who can't see another Joker getaway coming from a mile away.I'm no wimp -- I can be engrossed by and accept wholesale carnage when it's in something like ""Saving Private Ryan"" -- but this is yet another movie in which it doesn't matter how many faceless civilians and police die just as long as there can be lots of shooting and car crashes and the stars are OK.And what of poor Batman? Christian Bale does a creditable job in the role, yet this is really a movie about The Joker. The hero and who he is isn't nearly as well explored as the villain.Besides Ledger the two old pros, Michael Cain and Morgan Freeman, play the most interesting characters. Gary Oldman does a decent job as James Gordon. The problem is we're never given any reason to doubt him yet there is this undercurrent to the character that maybe he's not really working for the good guys.The scene where Batman hunts The Joker as SWAT teams come crashing into the building is one of the most confusing messes I've seen. There's no clear idea what's happening and why and The Joker's final capture is anticlimactic. The turn to the dark side by character Harvey Dent is poorly developed and in the final scenes, lacking much logic. And the suspension of logic -- especially when it comes to the evil doing of The Joker -- just goes too far.In the end, despite Batman's expected saving of the child, the movie simply peters out with a muddled message and Batman zooming off on his motorcycle in the direction of -- we can only presume -- another sequel.If you want a dark, action-packed film then see ""Quantum of Solace."" It's not a great film -- not nearly as good as ""Casino Royal"" -- but it's a fair shot better than ""The Black Knight.""","

"The Dark Knight","themkody","1 May 2011","Let me start off by saying that I hated this film. However, I'm giving it a fair rating anyway. As an avid comic-book fan, I've had the pleasure of seeing almost all of the comic book adaptations that have seen the light of the day (so far). And almost all of the films have been at least a worthwhile trip. Ironically, the highest rated comic book adaptation of all time, the film I'm reviewing right now, is pretty damn far down on that list. Everything that Burton did right in ""Batman"", Nolan did wrong in ""TDK"". TDK takes itself way too serious. I think Nolan missed the point of ""comic""-book. Comic, as in, amusement and entertainment. TDK is neither. It tries so hard to be a smart crime film, but to me it's just a bloody mess. The hero-villain confrontations simply falls flat, like a gum that lost it's flavor.Then there was the action sequences, which was entertaining enough to watch. But you know there's something wrong with the movie when you're only enthralled by the action sequences. The car chase sequence felt totally out of place, reminded me more of a trailer for a Fast and the Furious reboot. Then there was the cell phone gag, which felt totally out of place as well. ""Gotham City"" in TDK did nothing to me. There was nothing Gothic about it. Just an ordinary Hollywood city. Burton's portrayal of Gotham City in ""Batman"" was simply priceless. The atmosphere was just so good, the cinematography and editing were spot on. His Gothic approach to this kind of material is probably the best ever, the only film coming close is Sin City. Burton did it all on a $48 million budget. Nolan had a $185 million budget and he failed to accomplish this task. Sadly, he didn't learn anything from his mistakes in Batman Begins, but I guess that didn't stop people from funding him.Early Batman films were so fun to watch, and the actors that portrayed the villains, such as Jim Carrey, Jack Nicholson and Tommy Lee Jones, had such a great time, and it showed. Let's discuss the actor portraying the Joker who people praised to the skies: Heath Ledger. I completely fail to see how his performance could have been better than Nicholson, let alone equally good. Some say they were in the same league. Some say that the late Ledger was better by far. But good 'ol Nicholson will always be the true Joker to me. His portrayal of the Joker is probably one of the most accurately portrayed comic-book villains translated to the big screen, ever (some plot lines regarding the Joker was changed but Burton kept the character pure and original). Every single movement he made reflected something of his character. Heath Ledger's Joker was just a mad dog, as stated so many times during the film. Nothing more. His motives are unknown. In the original film, we are fully aware of the Joker's motives, and through flashbacks, we learn how he became such a gruesome monster. He's so fun to watch, not to mention that he actually laughs. Heath Ledger never even smirks (wait, a Joker that doesn't even laugh?) He doesn't pull any rabbits out of his hat like Nicholson. He just blows things up. He's just a sadistic nihilist and not a complex, unpredictable villain formerly known as Jack Napier. I hated how Nolan changed this character completely, if it was at least half as accurate as the original Joker, it might had been more interesting.Two-Face was an OK villain, but suffers from the same faults that the Joker had: he doesn't have any real motives! At least Tommy Lee Jones was fun to watch. We're never let into his head; at one point he is the good guy, and at the next he's the new villain. Why? The relationship between Rachel and Two-Face was laughable, the fact that he wanted to die for her was ridiculous. The fact that he wanted to blame everyone for Rachel's death, and use ""chance"" as an excuse for killing people was laughable. I wanted to know what happened in between. The characters in this film are simply not developed enough, which makes them boring and uninteresting. This problem wouldn't be as big if the movie didn't solely rely on (failed) tension and atmosphere. Without adding a pinch of entertainment, which is what a true comic book adaptation should include, the movie falls flat. And it doesn't have to be ha-ha entertainment, Sin City had both atmosphere and action, and succeeded at both; The Dark Knight had failed atmosphere and little action. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman all provide great screen presence, as always. And then there's Christian Bale, an otherwise excellent actor, who lost a lot of credibility to me after taking on the role of ""Batman"". What an awful choice. What a cringe-worthy performance. Keaton is without a doubt, the best Batman so far, while the rest are circus clowns compared to him.As a final conclusion, I cannot recommend this film. Lacking elements that a real comic book adaptation should have, such as visual effects and accurately portrayed villains that are actually interesting to watch, the only redeeming values are some of the actors who did an OK job, and a few of the action scenes, notably the sequence at the beginning. Christopher Nolan is a great director, who still manages to show his skills in this film, but sadly, the benefits are for naught. The film succeeds a few times at creating, stylish, tension scenes, but those few tense scenes are far from enough from what this film could have (and should) have been. ""The Dark Knight"" was a huge disappointment to me, and should have been a huge improvement upon Batman Begins. I'm glad I didn't see this film with high expectations.Moose finds this film worthy of a 7.","

"The Dark Knight","warren-1976","14 April 2009","Where did it all go wrong? Unfortunately all the hype turned out to be exactly that. Just hype. This is a mediocre and highly repetitive film, perhaps marginally better than average action movie. It certainly is a major improvement over the recent mess that was The Hulk, but that's not saying much. Then again, even The Hulk managed a little better in the character department for its first third, before devolving into mindless dross.They seem to have forgotten the things that made the first of the new Christian Bale Batman movies a success (In more than just box office). Dark Knight is a bloated misshapen mess of a film, with little coherent structure. From it's rather lacklustre opening to it's weak finale, we are just treated to a variety of scenes that just seem to have been lumped together. At 152 minutes, someone needed to seriously take the editing scissors to the negative. Then again, if the fat had been trimmed from this film, there wouldn't be much left. The first film worked, because we had different locations, an interesting back story, and some genuine character moments, that all came together to make the 'action' parts enjoyable. Because they had a reason for being, and we became invested in what happened to the characters.Dark Knight is simply a collection of action scenes, and 'Joker' scenes for the sake of it. Heath Ledger is serviceable as the Joker, but it's by no means an Oscar worthy performance. Jack Nicholson at least had a certain level of theatricality to make the character work, in Burton's Batman. Though in Heath Ledger's defence, he had very little to work with, character-wise. I think he did the best he could with it, despite lots of pointless 'Joker-giggling' and 'oh, look, I'm insane' expressions. There are virtually no meaningful character moments in the film, no real structure to the story, and so there is no emotional involvement in the action. The fight scenes seemed to lack any genuine sense of threat or risk, because it never felt like Batman was ever in danger. In the previous film, he was fighting people of equal training and skill, so you felt he was having to struggle to defeat his enemy. In Dark Knight, he's simply going through the motions. And any genuine threat in the violence is shied away from. Don't believe the other reviews. There's plenty of 'action' in this film, but not a lot of 'violence' as such. Which isn't always a good thing. It may keep it child-friendly (in a way) for the most part, but leaves us with no real sense of consequence or risk.In terms of setting, this time around they decided to film mostly on real city locations. The idea being, that this will make the atmosphere more realistic. Unfortunately this works against it. The ever so slight fantasy feel of Gotham in the first film, helps us as the viewer, to dwell in their reality and accept the fantastical parts. By bringing this new film more into the world of everyday reality, the more outlandish elements become less believable than they might have otherwise been, thereby resulting in a detachment from events, rather than drawing us in.Morgan Freeman is poorly used, with little to get his teeth into. While perhaps he did not have a large part in the previous film either, he was at least imbued with some sense of personality and a genuine feeling of necessity to the plot. Michael Caine fairs a little better, and is one of the few characters to maintain a reasonable level of personality and purpose, that is on a par with his character in Batman Begins.As for the Harvey Dent character, Aaron Eckhart is simply adequate, but apart from his general role as the District Attorney, his evolution into the 'Two Face' villain feels utterly superfluous and tacked-on for the sake of cramming in another temporary antagonist. Though admittedly, he has stunningly well executed CGI enhanced make-up. (unfortunately the un-shrivelled eye ruins the effect, since it simply would not have likely survived the wounds, and even if it had, would dry up and wither, without its surrounding tissue, eyelids and moisture.) He is supposed to be some sort of example about how evil can change and affect even the best of people, but it all feels clumsily executed and poorly resolved.So what's good? Maggie Gyllenhall as Rachel Dawes, brings her character some much needed depth. She's a more mature actress, both in style and looks, than Katie Holmes was (As the same character in the previous film). She also has a rather sad and tired appearance, which keeps her from looking like the typical overly-pretty female love-interest. She felt like a character that you could imagine he had grown up with and loved for herself, rather than simply an attractive face.To be honest, that's about the best that can be said, in comparison to the previous film. And in it's own right, it is a movie that can best be described as an enjoyable distraction, with virtually nothing to remember once you walk out. Sadly, this is very much another forgettable summer blockbuster. What makes it so disappointing is not that it is actually that bad, but simply that it should have been so much better, and certainly does not live up to the hype.","

"The Dark Knight","tubby1","1 January 2009","Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' is a big and bold production. The great special-effects, sharp editing and affecting score sweep the film into a high-entertainment package. It is a vast improvement on Batman Begins reaching a higher level of storytelling. Although there are self-evident inadequacies in the script this is a breakthrough film. The Dark Knight is a long film, and in this respect it surprisingly fails somewhat to provide enough depth. Instead we do get scenes where the obvious ineptitude of the police enable the plot to continue as it wishes. For example, why is a police officer in the same cell as The Joker when it was entirely unnecessary? It therefore sometimes falls more into a comic book experience conflicting unfortunately with the superior film elements. However,if this can be forgiven (as I have) Nolan has produced a successful cross-over from his somewhat comic book feature of Batman Begins. Heath Ledger is stunning as The Joker providing the emotional context and thrills. The set-pieces are as grand as they are gripping.A minor point, which I could not get away from was a particular moment when Bale is discussing gadgets with Freeman, was this just me or did anyone else feel like we were watching a James Bond and Q moment?The Dark Knight is a breakthrough film it is more majestic and gripping than any of its Batman predecessors. It is a superior film of entertainment only hampered by its over long-running time but ultimately it is a triumph.","

"The Dark Knight","st-shot","7 August 2008","One has to sit through a lot of idiocy in this sado masochistic wet dream in order to glean some exciting moments as this loud bombastic endless piece of highly polished garbage bashes it's way to a sequel. Given the running time there are plenty of thrills and chills that more or less simply repeat themselves for the last hour by which time it becomes a race between losing interest or your hearing.Gotham City is in danger of being picked clean by the mob. Only crusading DA Harvey Dent and Inspector Gordon stand between them. Enter the Joker, a sadistic yukster who can't get or deliver enough mayhem to all concerned. Even Batman has his hands full with the cruel overly optimistic and principled (it ain't about the money) bad Bozo. Now the stage is set to destruct much of the city, kill and injure much of the populace and give the Joker every opportunity to escape.Batman has always walked a fine line between fantasy and gritty realism (sci fi meets noir) that I felt succeeded when the tone was light. But this follow-up to Batman Begins allows even more darkness to seep in. The caped crusader is even more conflicted this time around since he's still sweet on his ex, now the DA's girlfriend. Then there is the impervious Joker. Still the energizer bunny to punishment he bounces back like a Joe Palooka doll no matter how bad the beating. After all if you kill him, you maim the sequel. The mirthful maniac, so crucial to keeping the train running is simply replaced by another less resilient villain.As Bruce Wayne, Christian Bale displays an ambiguous menace. As Batman he exchanges boiler plate philosophies (sprinkled with Bush administration policy) with cops and crooks sounding as if he has severe emphysema. It's hard to say if it's Heath Ledger or the make-up that makes him so ominous. Certainly the most sadistic Joker to date he lack's Nicholson's breezy take and better cosmetics as well as TV Joker Caesar Romero's boundless comic energy. But even with an Uncle Fester intonation he is a disturbing and convincing example of the fearless nihilist.Director Chris Nolan pours the chaos and carnage on like syrup with sensorial disregard. There's a well edited bank heist at the beginning of the film and Batman gets to tool around Gotham in a really cool motorcycle (Bat cycle?) but the biggest budget on earth (this may well have been) cannot disguise the fact it it is an inferior work to his gripping and imaginative Memento. Like another Indy phenom Steven Soderbergh he has chosen to sell out (Who can blame him, who wouldn't want a piece of the film gross?) to make bloated shiny movies that make a lot of noise and cash. The Hollywood moguls gain is the art house loss with this one time original filmmaker.The evolvement of Batman from the unique comic book crime fighter to the satirically brilliant TV show to the mega monster super film franchise has gone through many transformations to date. From the record breaking box office returns most would agree that it's for the better. Call me sentimental but it will never improve over the comic I would read twice while sitting under the maple tree in my yard and then trade even up with my friends for a Flash or a Green Lantern. Loud as this slick and crass masterpiece of marketing is it will never deliver the bang for the buck that the pages of the comic fed my imagination without all the noise.","

"The Dark Knight","Turfseer","15 April 2010","Unlike their first entry in their Batman series, the Nolan brothers juxtapose their comic book characters against a well-lit Chicago urban backdrop—they seem out of place in the real world and would have been much more at home in a make-believe noirish setting.The opening scene urges us not to take any of the antagonists seriously. As a bank robbery unfolds, the criminals end up double-crossing one another, shooting one another in the back. Only Health Ledger's Joker is left standing, collecting all the proceeds from the robbery. From the outset, the Joker faces no obstacles and appears almost omnipotent.The next thirty minutes consists of a series of very slow-moving expository scenes. There's a clash between mobsters and a few Batman wannabes show up (The leader of the wannabes is later captured by the Joker and in a repugnant scene is tortured in a video clip shown on the evening news). Cut to Bruce Wayne's 'Bat Cave' which looks more like a concrete bunker fitted with large high definition computer screens (so much for the neat old Bat Cave!). Michael Caine as Bruce Wayne's affable butler has little to do except impart pithy advice to his boss. Then there's the relationship between DA Harvey Dent and his girlfriend Rachel, who Bruce has an interest in (the love triangle never seems to develop). After Dent invokes RICO laws, the mobsters agree to allow one of their own, Lau, a Chinese Mafia accountant from Hong Kong to hold all their cash outside the US where the DA can't get his hands on it. Wayne then makes his way to Hong Kong where Batman manages to break into Lau's impenetrable skyscraper, kidnap him and return him to the DA where he's placed under arrest. Of course, this sideshow has nothing to do with the main plot which involves the Joker approaching the mobsters and agreeing to take half their cash in exchange for killing Batman. After the bosses refuse to go along with the Joker's proposal, one of the bosses, Gambol, puts a bounty on the Joker's head. The Joker then gains easy entry into Gambol's lair in a body bag, only to jump out and then kill the hapless criminal by slashing his throat with a knife (the point is made that the Joker is a sadist and the Nolans appear to congratulate themselves by emphasizing that fact over and over again without regard for good taste or an economical narrative).The rest of the film's extremely convoluted plot mainly concerns the Joker's efforts to eliminate his nemesis, The Dark Knight. The Joker declares if Batman doesn't reveal his identity, people will die each day until he decides to act. When the Police Commissioner and Judge presiding over the mob trials are assassinated, the public blames Batman. DA Dent concocts a plan to draw the Joker out by claiming that he's The Dark Knight. As Dent is transported in an armored car, the Joker attacks but is captured by Batman aided by Lt. Gordon who is soon promoted to police commissioner as a result of his heroic efforts in capturing the Joker.We never see how it happens but Dent and Rachel disappear and soon turn up as hostages at a warehouse. Batman gets a little rough with the Joker in jail and it's revealed that some corrupt police officials (they seem to be all over the place) were the one's who kidnapped the DA and his girlfriend. It turns out that one of the Joker's associates who he was imprisoned with has a cell phone implanted in his chest (don't know why he wasn't put through a metal detector) and when the phone rings, there's a huge explosion and the Joker and Lau both escape. Batman is able to save the DA but is unable to rescue Rachel. Despite surviving an explosion Dent's face is maimed and now he becomes the second villain of the movie, 'Two Face"".The unlikeable Joker proves even less charming when he declares he has no interest in money and torches Lau who is tied up in a warehouse on top of a giant pile of cash. Then in the most ludicrous part of the movie, the Joker visits Dent in the hospital and convinces him to take revenge on all the corrupt people responsible for Rachel's death. How the good guy DA could morph into a sinister criminal so easily just proves how silly the whole story is (instead of honoring his girlfriend's memory, he too conveniently becomes a bad guy!).The finale features a bunch of convicts and upstanding citizens held hostage on two separate ferry boats. The boats are rigged with explosives (how did they get on the boats undetected?). Each person on the ferries have the ability to set off the explosions but out of the goodness of everybody's hearts, no one can bring themselves to act.Finally, in the most distasteful scene in the movie, Dent attempts to kill Commissioner Gordon's son by throwing him over the side of a building. The killing of a child is not something that should be shown in a story that's supposedly taken from a comic book.Despite the absurd, overlong plot, The Dark Knight wouldn't have been so bad if the filmmakers didn't take themselves so seriously. Did they really have to rehash their point ad infinitum—that criminals are sadistic? Somehow a little humor could have humanized all the comic book characters and made the film a lot more enjoyable. Instead, the Dark Knight is an example of lazy screen writing where there is no interest in explaining one implausible event after another.","

"The Dark Knight","regular8","24 August 2008","This movie is too long by about 30 minutes. I was happy when the screen finally went dark. A filmmaker should be able to get his point across in under 2 hours or before the collective audience ass starts hurting.It's a comic book and the effects and makeup are really great, but still, some of it is too inexplicable and so beyond the possible that it undermines the characters. The Joker is deliciously strange and evil but if he can arrange those events that are so very complex, he starts to look more like a circus ringleader whose dancing dogs and fireworks are the real characters.The story was very hard for me to follow. I don't appreciate having to try so hard to figure out what and why things happen in a movie. I am still not sure why Mr. ""Two Face"" went sour and frankly I didn't care that he did.There is a very heavy thematic effort here; much of film is trying to clearly define good vs. evil and the shifting ambiguity of that, to end with Batman becoming rather dark and isolated. I applaud this kind of effort in an action film, but here the authors take just too long to get there. I was itching to get out of my seat and had to force myself to sit through to the very end, and that's not good for any movie.","

"The Dark Knight","Doctor_Mongoose","1 August 2008","Obviously Christopher Nolan was trying to touch on one of the prominent issues of recent times. That of the environment. He did this by recycling tired old jokes and set pieces from many action films before, and the rest of the plot was salvaged from toilets and rubbish bins. He also comes up with the perfect formula to make a profound sentence, by taking two words that mean complete opposites and shoving them together.Joking aside, after almost nodding off for the first hour and a half the second half of the movie actually was pretty good, albeit drawn out until the ending which was very frustrating. They literally left the joker hanging while dealing with the completely pointless and irrational side-story of two-face. I'd have thought that a man of dent's resolve would have been made stronger by the events that took place, to get back at the joker and stop such events from happening to other people, instead of deteriorating into the monster of similar calibre to the joker.I really don't think the film got the best out of the actors involved, probably due to the script. Christian Bale is a fantastic actor, but he is completely wasted as batman where he spends most of his time jumping about in a bat-suit using a silly voice, instead of displaying his incredible character acting skills in movies such as American Psycho and the Machinist. Heath Ledger's performance was the only real solid one in the entire cast, however at plenty of times he guilty of completely over-acting. His introduction to the members of the mob was farcical and the laughter in the cinemas was due to the awkwardness and stupidity of the situation.The main reason I think the film totally fails is Christopher Nolans approach of trying to make the film really realistic with an explanation for everything. A man running around in a bat costume and a man dressed up in clown make-up is just to surreal to try and be addressed in this manner. This is why I think the original Batman is a lot better because it didn't try to be ultra-realistic and took the comics and had a fairly serious tone with a very comedic undercurrent. Christopher Nolan undoubtedly has talent as a director, memento, the prestige and even insomnia are all great films but I feel his attempts at the batman franchise are far outshone by Tim Burton.Obviously the film is already a hit and there is nothing anyone can write to stop it from being so, however I must implore you to actually watch the film critically and realise its shortcomings, than get swept away in the hype.","

"The Dark Knight","hughman55","29 July 2008","I saw this movie on a Monday afternoon in hopes of avoiding a long wait and big crowds at the theater. Good plan. It worked. The movie didn't. Many reviewers have already commented on the gross mediocrity of this film so I'll skip that part. There were some very good, though isolated, moments in the story: a lesson about how torture is wrong and doesn't work, the equal value of all lives regardless of how they have been lived, ""abridged"" civil rights are neither civil nor right, etc. I like all those concepts and they are certainly worthy of exploration given our current political state.To me, however, the most prominent feature of this film was neither Heath Ledger, (whom I greatly respect as an actor), Christian Bale, nor the script, directing, story line, performances, or suspense, but rather the gorrific violence that punctuated almost every moment of the more than two and a half hours this thing went on. Everything in this movie explodes!!! And the cut aways in the editing do nothing to mitigate the impact of all the slashing, stabbing, pounding, bludgeoning, shooting, and impaling that becomes ridiculous about halfway through. And though I have enormous respect for him, Ledger's Joker was basically Ted Bundy with face paint. I think the inspiration for this film came more from Oliver Stone's ""Natuarl Born Killers"" than from anything that was ever written in a comic book.All you need to know is this... In the last ten minutes of the film, with the body count hovering somewhere around 100, a scene begins to unfold where a young child is about to be murdered in cold blood, (those of you who have seen the movie know what I'm talking about). The scene goes on for what I thought was an excruciatingly long time, but even as it was just beginning I was thinking to myself, ""no, no, no, this is wrong. This should not be done this way in a movie"". Then somewhere in the theater, behind me, a child began sobbing uncontrollably. Yes, real terror, real horror, real fear, a real child, right there in the theater. The scene finally came to an end. The sobbing didn't. As the lights came up for us to leave I saw a couple escorting their approximately 12 year old son out of the theater, still sobbing, and hanging on to his parents' clothing as they walked out.I don't blame the parents. This movie's PG13 rating is unconscionable. This is a ""Batman"" movie! With a PG13 rating! ""Batman"" originated from a children's comic book series. One would think that this movie would be a safe experience for children. It's not. Given the grotesque thread of constant violence that runs from the opening credits to the closing credits it's not even suitable for adults. Several of the postings here at IMDb with the lowest ratings have noted that they are putting their rating as low as possible to balance out the overly generous perfect scores that have vaulted this movie into the position of being one of the greatest film ever,according to IMDb. Not me. I really didn't like this movie. And in the last ten minutes of it I came to hate it. It does not do service to the Batman franchise, or movies in general. There is not a shred of ""comic book"" appeal in it anywhere, and it will take it's place as one of the most uselessly violent movies ever made. That this offering has the broad appeal it has makes me a little sad, and sick inside. And if I could speak for the poor kid that was sitting behind me during this bloated gore fest I'd say this, ""thanks for the memories"".","

The movie is still powerfull and full of suprises. The story line is very good; it has multiple stories that are bend togheter in different stages of the movie. That makes the movie atrractive to watch even if you already have seen it.There is plenty of action with nice realistic combat scenes. The evil Joker is a solid opponent versus batman. I liked the psychological deepness that is showed in different stages inside the story. That makes the movie als interesting for more intelligent people.Besides batman and the joker, there are three other major roles. You can almost choose witch character you like the most. But watch out; it can be devastating for you in the end!All by all a solid 10. You wont see movies like this much these days.","

"The Dark Knight","krzysiektom","21 July 2008","I wanted to love this film. I hoped it would live up to the hype. I feel it does not. It is a solid film, ambitious and serious. Maybe too serious. Most of it are chaotic chases and fights or serious, somber talk about politics and commitment. Almost entire film is in the urban dark surroundings, literally dark, which is a lot to take in a very long movie. And too much Republican agenda for my liking, characters say it has to be worse before it gets better, u should endure a period of unpopularity, u stand for more important things than the public image, there are guys who do not follow logic, they just want to see the world burn, vigilantism is a price of freedom etc. One might think this Batman is, ehm, George W., Joker is Bin Laden and Gotham is America. Too much in a film about a guy in a plastic suit with two protruding ears who can fly, chasing a megalomaniac made up like a clown. A maniac that defies realism too, being able to be in many places at will, move around secretly tons of explosives etc. For a movie that takes itself that serious the transition of Dent into TwoFace is simplistic and shallow. Of course he fails to shoot the little blond boy because Batman intervenes at the last moment. It was a scene like from Peter Pan movie. And Batman has to beat Joker up to get the whereabouts of kidnapped Dent and his girlfriend but on two other occasions he knows where Dent is, just to intervene in time. For me the music was the only stand out, on its own keeping the adrenaline up.","

I saw this first in the theater, and to be honest, probably would've given it a bit higher rating...if I would've reviewed it then. But........I just watched it again on cable and it doesn't hold up as well outside of the movie theater with it's huge screen, dark room and loud speakers. First off...what I liked. Heath Leadger was fantastic as the Joker and could've done so much more with it if the writing and plot had been better. The movie should've focused on a battle of wits and balls between Batman and Joker. That would've been more interesting. I liked Morgan Freeman. I enjoy his character. I like that there wasn't some big distracting relationship for Batman/Bruce. I even enjoyed some of the explosions. I hate Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce. He just doesn't emote anything. Also...HE HAS THE WORST BATMAN VOICE EVER....EVER....EVER!!!! The movie was way too long and had way too many subplots going. I could've lived without the whole Harvey Dent thing. Why introduce Two Face just to kill him off? It made no sense. Then again, a lot of the subplots made no sense. The movie takes itself too seriously. There's really no humor either. I realize the whole idea was to make it dark, but sheesh, c'mon. There were too many just shoved in there explosions going on. It felt like two movies being rammed into one. It's just too much. Too many things going on that don't really gel together. I guess I'm tired of movies that offer more in explosions and chases than solid story telling and characters you can give a damn about. I honestly could not sit through this movie again. If I do anything, I'll watch it free on demand and fast forward to the Heath Leadger scenes. He did so much with what he was given to work with.....which wasn't any where near what it could have been. All in all...this movie doesn't live up to the hype.","

"The Dark Knight","jmaycock","25 August 2008","I know I am going against the tide here. And I am happy that so many people had a good experience watching this film. I didn't. Maybe I just don't get it? I'm not sure, because I am a fan of superhero films in general. I think perhaps what I don't like is a superhero film that tries to be so serious as to make us believe in it. Batman, and previously I would say Unbreakable, fall into this category. If you want me to take you seriously then tell me this. How the hell does a guy with his face painted run around a city causing mayhem without getting caught? How does a guy who kills his accomplices continue to have support? I mean he even burns the loot so money isn't the answer. How does a guy who claims he doesn't like planning (because he's too crazy to care about planning) manage to get so many barrels of oil and dynamite positioned all around the city with ease. How does he get said equipment on to the two very important ships? A city that is on high alert? Was there nobody to check? The list goes on and on. If the film wants to be taken seriously, I think it has to fill these holes. If it doesn't, then no problem. There can be as many holes as you like.Another bad point was the length of the film. Far too long.On the plus side the acting was very good, although I didn't like the overly put on voice of Batman. However, Ledger deserves all the praise he has been getting for this.","

"The Dark Knight","come2whereimfrom","25 July 2008","So much has been said on the latest instalment of the revitalised Batman franchise, dead stars, posthumous Oscars, arrests at premiers, will it lead to a rise in knife crime? Etc. but the only relevant question is it any good? Well Hamlet this is not so all those five star reviews and people intent on gushing all over it can calm down. Yes its dark, yes Batman is plagued by his demons, yes Heath is great, it's not comparable to Michael Mann's Heat, when all is said and done this is an OK superhero movie but considering it cost $185 million its hard to see where all that money has been spent. From a bank heist beginning that meanders to a pointless appearance of the Scarecrow to Bale flying on to the screen it seems to push all the right buttons and at the point that the Joker does his magic trick you could still be forgiven for thinking this is a five star visual feast. But unfortunately the set up doesn't really lead anywhere, there are no set pieces and at times it is even incoherent in its plot which could be from trying to cram too much information in an already overlong film. The twists, yes there are a few, are boringly obvious and I'm really not sure what happens to Bruce Wayne's voice when he dons the Batsuit but it changes to sound like a sort of vaudevillian heavy breather. That said Heath did make me laugh, he is not the most iconic screen bad guy since Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet, but he is good and the supporting cast all put in fine performances. The musical style has been borrowed from a Michael Mann film and the direction is brilliant in parts but as a whole it doesn't seem to gel together. Ironically the Jokers catch phrase is 'why so serious?' And if all involved had maybe listened to him and not be so serious, pretentious even then it may have been a much better film all round. Worth watching but not, as according to the IMDb, the greatest film of all time.","

"The Dark Knight","DreddMancunian","14 December 2009","Like most people, I am familiar with Batman. I read Frank Miller's gritty Dark Knight Returns comic in the 1980s, but also watched with glee the comic spoof of the 1960s TV series. I enjoyed the Tim Burton Gothic fairytale, and even the rather dour Batman Begins. But a few minutes into this movie, I thought to myself ""What is this? It isn't Batman!"" This was like a grumpy James Bond. And that feeling lingered throughout the film. This is just my opinion - but I didn't see Batman anywhere here. From Christian Bale's gargling caped spy to the Heath Ledger's raspy bank robber with make-up, I found myself longing for an actual Batman story. Batman would NOT do the things the does in this film - he does not let his lady love die to protect the career of an attorney. If the filmmakers wanted to see how to solve this problem, they should have watched Spider-Man. Yes, his motivations are complex, but in this film he positively revels in doing the wrong thing. He is a soulless instrument of the law - not a vigilante - not even someone interested in justice. And I for one am sick of people talking to him, turning away, then looking back to see he has disappeared! If he was that fast how come he couldn't dispose of both bombs at once?Many people have ruminated on the deep philosophical questions asked by this movie. Yet they don't make sense. The film is turgid, doesn't make it's points clearly, and contradicts itself. The message at one point is that people can make the right decisions. Yet Batman himself makes the wrong decision - as shown by what happens to Harvey Dent. And the final scene seems to contradict this point - people get the hero they need, not that they deserve. It seems the writers were going for as many profoundly deep points they could make, without bothering to string them together into a coherent drama. This is one of the few movies (and certainly the only superhero movie) that I ever felt like walking out of - especially during the Harvey Dent subplot that feels like an extra 30 minutes tacked on to the story for no good reason - and haven't we even seen this before in Batman Forever?In short, this over-hyped, bloated movie didn't - for me at least - live up to its expectations. It wasn't Batman, and I'm not sure I know what it is.","

"The Dark Knight","zarrod","11 September 2008","Well, this film is the most overrated movie I can remember but that doesn't mean it sucks at all. It's well made, with great shots and good acting (at least by Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Heath Ledger). The action scenes are filmed more coherently than Batman Begins and that pencil trick was awesome.Still, there are too many ridiculous scenes (like flying out of a window with a cable attached to a plane and cell phones turning into radar machines) and completely unnecessary plot lines. Do I really care if Commissioner Gordon plays dead for half the film and his wife gets mad at him or some Chinese guy is hording the criminal's cash? No. Give us more confrontation between the hero and villain. Lastly, the dark themes this film deals with are taken a little too seriously for a movie about a superhero of sorts. He wears a cape and a mask and fights crime as a symbol... don't try and get me emotionally involved in any THEME greater than that. Develop the characters and make me care about them. The animated ""Batman and the Mask of the Phantasm"" did a better job with that.Whatev, i've rambled long enough. It's still a very enjoyable movie and if I see it again i'll probably like it more but there's no way this deserves all the praise it gets. I'd really give it a 6.5 out of ten but we can't do .5s and this definitely does not belong in the top movies of all time. Too bad because it might be worthy of a 7 or 8 had it not been hyped up like it was the gift of Zeus.","

I can step back and objectively say it was a ""good"" movie on some levels, the performances, over-the-top entertainment, etc. But the bottom line is I hated it. Loud, obnoxious, pointless, and soulless. Who are these awful people? Heath Ledger immersed himself into the role of the Joker, and it was impressive. He's fascinating to watch. But what is the point of his character? At least Jack Nicholson was humorous in the role, Heath's joker is just a train wreck psychopath with absolutely no redeeming value. I don't get the point. Why do we find these despicable characters entertaining, are we that desperate?I was disappointed in Christian Bale too. He is one of the best actors working today, but this time he was kind of flat. I thought he was better in Batman Begins. This entire movie is just so over-the-top: explosions (wow an explosion, that's new), the cool looking but ridiculous motor-cycle, the millionth chase scene, repulsive characters like Two-Face, and on and on. We've seen it all so movie makers have to go to extreme lengths to entertain us jaded moviegoers, and this loud, obnoxious trash is the result. We really are getting desperate.I usually agree with IMDb more or less, the ratings are usually reliable. But right now this is #5, come on could we please settle down on the hyperbole with this movie? I'm not hating it on purpose because of the hype, I liked Iron Man and that got hyped, I liked the Wrestler and that got hyped. But this nightmare of a movie needs a backlash.","

"The Dark Knight","Benedict_Cumberbatch","28 July 2008","Naturally, ""The Dark Knight"" doesn't deserve a #1 spot on a Top 250 list (it's ranked #1 on IMDb with a 9.4/10 rating out of 156, 218 votes as of July 28, 2008), but that's a silly discussion since everyone has a different favourite film and you can't expect ""Citizen Kane"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (neither of these is my fave, by the way) to be more popular than (good or bad) summer blockbusters on a virtual world populated mostly by teenagers who dig Michael Bay's flicks (and I hate to sound so arrogant here, I'm not trying to imply young people have no taste, I barely left my teenage years myself... but that's the average public, right?), thus these lists shouldn't be taken too seriously.That said, ""The Dark Knight"" promises and delivers, more than living up to the hype. Christopher Nolan made something even bigger and better than his ""Batman Begins"" (2005), topping Tim Burton's first two installments of the series (and let's not even mention Joel Schumacher's name... he doesn't need to be humiliated any more than he's been - let's just forget he exists). The movie works in epic proportions as the possible greatest superhero movie ever made, and easily the most exciting action movie in many years (and this is coming from someone who doesn't dig action flicks that much). The cast (Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman) is also the best in the whole series, and Ledger is clearly the standout (and trust me, he's THAT good, and all that praise isn't because of sentimental reasons): his Joker is a blast, psychotic, scary, hilarious and darkly charismatic. And if the buzz makes it to the end of the year, I can definitely see him getting a well deserved posthumous Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. Whether you're a huge Batman fan or just want a perfect summer flick, ""The Dark Knight"" shall not let you down. Bravo, Mr. Nolan - there's still intelligent life in Hollywood! 10/10.","

"The Dark Knight","Danusha_Goska","25 July 2008","""Batman: The Dark Knight"" is a tacky, trashy, mindless, ultra violent piece of garbage. It will bore anyone with a mature mind. ""The Dark Knight"" consists of one sadistic, pointlessly violent scene after another. There is no point to these scenes except to extract money from the pockets of teenage boys who have had no experience of real life. ""The Dark Knight"" is a drug. It pushes violence and sadism. That's it. That's what you get for your ten bucks.""The Dark Knight"" is a sick product of a sick system. What's the difference between a blockbuster death-fest like this, and an act of actual terrorism? How many deaths do films like this contribute to? How much suffering? Pointless, ugly, violent, sadistic movies peddle violence as the drug of choice to mindless consumer hoards who lack discrimination, life experience, wisdom or balance.Teenage boys who spend all their time playing video games and having no experience of three-dimensional reality see a movie like this and conclude that the world is like this: cool criminals torture passive victims and meet no resistance. Hey, Thanks, Hollywood, for flushing your refuse into young male minds. Ka-ching. How much more violent and sadistic will such films have to be in the future to make that cash register sing? Let's up the ante.The Plot? Heath Ledger puts on a ridiculous series of ticks, costumes and make-up and tries really hard to get taken seriously as a master criminal / master actor. There is no real performance there because there is no real life there. In one scene, Ledger, a slight young man, murders a very large, muscular, professional criminal, and a black man  white supremacists will like that part  with a pencil. No. In real life that would not happen. Nor, in real life, would a man who shoots his every accomplice be able to do pull off any of the stunts ledger does in this film.The movie is utterly implausible. This won't matter to its fans, who talk only to other fans who worship films like this as they do. In their solipsistic, computer-generated echo chamber, ""The Dark Knight"" is the greatest film ever made. These fans have little contact with anyone not exactly like themselves, and can't see any flaws in their judgment. Though saturated in violence, these fans can't even see why a skinny guy like Ledger murdering a muscular, hardened criminal with a pencil is a silly, nasty, scene that exists only to up the sadism ante, not to have any relationship with reality. Though saturated in violence, these fans would panic at the merest contact with the real world, with the real violence occurring in places like Iraq, or federal prisons.Christian Bale is an interesting actor and was fun to watch in the previous batman. He's hardly on screen here. There is nothing interesting about the sets or costumes, and as for the special effects, how many chase scenes and big explosions have been on screen recently? Nothing new. Nothing interesting. The intelligent viewer will move along, or simply select a better film.","

"The Dark Knight","shiftyeyeddog","18 July 2008","Let's get this out of the way right off the top: Heath Ledger is nothing short of amazing in this film. ** Heath Ledger's Joker makes Jack Nicholson's Joker look like Cesar Romero's Joker. ** Less cartoony and far more menacing, this Joker actually feels dangerous. Every moment he's on screen your eyes are simply glued there, just soaking in this iconic performance. His look, his mannerisms, his voice... they all come together to make the perfect Joker, and probably the best villain ever seen on screen in a superhero movie... or any movie, for that matter. It's really quite a shame Ledger passed away, as I would love to have seen him portray that character again and again. Does the rest of the movie match this level of excellence? Well, not entirely... It's got plenty of action, just enough humor, and a good script for the most part, but there are a couple minor things that bothered me slightly: If they have to recast Rachel Dawes, fine, but Maggie Gyllenhal is a big step down; Bale's gruff ""Batman"" voice still sounds a little over-the-top and almost humorous at times; and the movie takes a few unnecessary turns, especially towards the end. Much off this is due to the involvement of ""Two-Face."" This film didn't need a second villain. His time on screen does nothing but make the audience wish they'd hurry up and get back to the REAL villain. I've never cared for the character, and I suppose it's good they didn't wait to try to use him as the sole foe in a future film, but he simply didn't do anything for me. Aside from those aspects, however, it's difficult to find much to criticize in this movie. I struggled greatly with the rating for this one, as without The Joker, the rest would only have made for another above-average film like Batman Begins. But Ledger's Joker is undeniably the star of this show, and based on that performance alone, I spot it the higher rating. Forget The Dark Knight - they should just call this The Joker. Ledger simply OWNS this film.","

"The Dark Knight","Horror-yo","15 October 2018","Batman. Pause and think about that character for a minute.
""The Batman"" is a guy in a spandex bat suit going around fighting crime, a superhero character from a comic book from the 1940's for young children looking for a bit of fun and a place for their juvenile imaginations to run free. His sworn enemy is ""the Joker"", a clown with clown tricks up his sleeve who's a villain.Where the earlier Tim Burton adaptations were fun and tongue in cheek, this here takes the Batman, the guy running around in spandex in a bat suit fighting off the bad guys... and makes an attempt at a disconcertingly, utterly serious film noir with an atmosphere about as dense as a horror movie, exceeding the 2hr30 mark. It's... like a joke, it's something akin to the concept for a comedy sketch one would have. To take something a bit ridiculous and light, and reverse its momentum in making it into this piece that takes itself completely, utterly seriously. It's a very common premise for many comedy sketches or concepts.The fact it was received so absurdly well by the greater public is, sadly, testament to how empty and strayed our current times are, that the common individual looks for a hero and ideals of greatness, epic drama, and meaning, in something like a 3 hour long horror movie/thriller version of Batman directed by Christopher Nolan. And this review doesn't even take into account the film from a technical perspective: too many characters, cringy silly scenes, way too long... etc","

"The Dark Knight","ldavis-2","14 June 2009","The Batsuit can deflect bullets, but it can't withstand a dog attack? Holy Wardrobe Malfunction! If I were Bruce Wayne, I would have kicked Morgan Freeman's backside back to The Electric Company, and sued the crap out of the firm that made the material that was supposed to protect my richer-than-God self from the likes of Cujo! But then, that would make way too much sense, and ""sense"" is something that the Batman franchise has never been accused of having!Say what you will about Tim Burton's and Joel Schumacher's Batman movies: at least they never pretended to be anything other than silly popcorn flicks. Christopher Nolan, on the other hand, wants to be Ingmar Bergman when he grows up -- which is why he rips off Burton! Don't tell me that ridiculous standoff was a happy accident, Ledger grunting ""Come on, come on, hit me"" à la Jack? Batman doesn't turn The Joker into roadkill because he has a moral code? Give me a break! And, for a self-proclaimed ""agent of chaos"", every one of The Joker's actions are oddly well-planned and executed. Memo to Nolan: look up ""chaos"" in the dictionary!Which leads me to Ledger. Since when does twitching like a coked-up Mexican jumping bean constitute acting? No disrespect, but let's be real: if he hadn't died, that truly morbid Oscar campaign wouldn't have sprung up, and he wouldn't have been nominated, much less, won. As I could never understand Ledger half the time because none of his directors had the balls to tell him to enunciate like a normal human being, he had to have been dubbed, because I actually understood every word he said!And it's ""close to the vest"", NOT ""close to the chest""!

"The Dark Knight","billcr12","2 April 2012","Other than Heath Ledger's magnificent, brooding and evil Joker, I am stunned by the rating here on IMDb. I found The Dark Knight noisy, overlong and annoying. Joker demands that Batman reveal his real identity or someone will die every day at random. A newly appointed district attorney claims to be Batman. He is abducted and placed in a building with explosives. Dent's face is badly burned in an explosion, but he survives. More bombs go off followed by chases on motorcycle and confrontation with the Joker, mobsters and various other villains. I completely lost interest in this endless, two and a half plus hour fiasco. Christopher Nolan needs serious counseling and to learn that some things need to be left out. Rest in peace, Mr. Ledger, it wasn't your fault.","

"The Dark Knight","vanessaluberti","14 November 2023","""The Dark Knight"" isn't just a movie; it's a cinematic success that transcends the superhero genre, leaving a lasting mark on the world of film. Nolan masterfully weaves a complex and morally ambiguous take of chaos and order, exploring the thin line between heroism and villainy. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is legendary! He is a force of nature and added layers of depth to the character. Heath Ledger steals every scene with a magnetic presence that is both terrifying and mesmerizing. Christopher Nolan's vision, coupled with Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance makes it an instant modern classic.","

"The Dark Knight","Michael_Elliott","23 December 2008","Dark Knight, The (2008) **** (out of 4) I'll be honest and admit that I'm not much of a fan of the so called ""comic book"" movies out there. I'll also be honest and admit that I didn't care for the previous series of Batman movies from Burton and Schumacher. Batman Begins on the other hand was a different story as it found it to be incredibly good but a rare occasion as occurred as this sequel is even better. I've always felt that comic book movies didn't contain enough elements of a dark nature nor did they contain very much adult-themed stuff but that's certainly not the case here as this movie contains enough character development and moral questions for three movies. The epic nature of this movie makes it a one of a kind even though I think the 151-minute running time is the only fault in the film. It's rather amazing at how dark this movie is yet movie crowds ate it up but perhaps they ate so much of it up simply because of how dark it is. This film works on so many levels but I think the biggest are its screenplay and actors. The darkness of the story is perfectly brought to the screen by Nolan with his masterful direction, which paints the perfect picture of corruption, greed and moral responsibility. All of the characters from The Joker to Harvey Dent to even Batman must face various moral issues and this type of stuff not only makes for great drama but it brings a lot of depth to this ""comic book"" movie. The performances are all quite remarkable and that includes the late Heath Ledger as The Joker. Before seeing the film I kept asking myself if his performance could top that of Jack Nicholson but I think that question shouldn't even be asked as both performances are so completely different that you can't compare them. Ledger certainly steals the show and leaves the viewer with goose bumps each time he's on the screen. It really seems as if he just floats through each scene as if he were a ghost roaming around. The walk that Ledger brings to the character is so refreshing and original that I couldn't take my eyes off of him. That wonderful talk and the brilliant line giving just adds to the fun and was it ever great to see such a dark villain. Christian Bale is also once again very good in the role of Bruce Wayne and Batman. Again, the screenplay benefits Bale greatly by having him just as dark as the villains. Aaron Eckhart is getting overshadowed by Ledger but he too really deserves a lot of credit as he probably gives the best performance of anyone dealing with the moral issues. His stint as Dent is perfect for a hero and his turn as Two-Face is perfect for a villain. Maggie Gyllenhaal also does a good job in the love interests role as does Michael Caine, Eric Roberts and Morgan Freeman. Gary Oldman also shines in his role of Gordon. What makes the special effects so great is that the movie isn't in their hand as far as entertainment goes. Yes, the effects and chase sequences look great but they work even better because the screenplay gives us characters to care about. I won't go as far as to call this one of the greatest films ever made but I do think it has to change the way comic book movies are made.","

"The Dark Knight","karydacunha","14 January 2009","This Batman installment isn't a bad one it's just been completely overrated since the passing of Heath Ledger. Secondly there was way too much material to be packed into the three hours alloted. If anyone knows anything about the back story of Harvey Dent/Two Face they are just left feeling empty and the character itself unjustified. I understand Nolan was trying to do something different with the Joker, but why disrespect Two Face? Also, there was really no Batman/Bruce Wayne complex which I enjoy and feel is important to every Batman film. Overall a good action film, but will not be adding to my Batman movie collection. Hopefully Nolan brings back Two Face in the next film and gives him a face.","

"The Dark Knight","Goodbye_Ruby_Tuesday","18 July 2008","It's an unwritten rule that in superhero movies, the sequels rarely to never live up to the standards of the original--how many of us were spellbound by THE MATRIX only to be jilted by its disastrous sequels? THE DARK KNIGHT squashes any presumptions that nothing could ever surpass the original, whose wholesome darkness, originality and excitement made it possible for comic book adaptations/blockbusters to become more than the sum of its genre. Christopher Nolan has outdone himself in every way possible. BATMAN BEGINS was about Bruce Wayne's roots and his journey to becoming Batman. Very interestingly, the emotional arc of THE DARK KNIGHT is not on Batman (though Christian Bale is still solid as both charming Bruce and his darker alter ego), but rather on Harvey Dent's (an excellent Aaron Eckhart) crusade against corruption and how own eventual dark journey that, by either chance or choice, will shape him into a hero or a villain. The love story between Dent and Rachel Dawes, who cannot wait for Bruce anymore, is also what supplies THE DARK KNIGHT with its human heart, and what makes the film's dark turns all the more poignant and suspenseful. Everything about THE DARK KNIGHT is edgier, from the music (the screeching buildup is at times unbearable) to the violence (the Joker's disappearing pencil trick will shock you). A great deal of this is indebted to Heath Ledger. If Ledger hadn't died tragically young last January, the sold-out midnight/3 am/6 am showings probably wouldn't have been as momentous, but the kudos for his performance still would've been higher than the skies. To say that his performance is majestic isn't enough--it transcends Brando and Cagney and de Niro and Malcolm McDowell's astonishing performance as Alex de Large. A film critic for Entertainment Weekly once wrote about Christian Bale in RESCUE DAWN that ""I've never seen the actor look more at home with his own taut charisma."" That praise has to be passed on to Ledger, who seems so comfortable with his madness it's truly terrifying; When I was in the crowded theater I thought, ""this must've been what it was like back in 1955, when REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE came out, just after James Dean died."" Ledger will become a cult figure, there is no doubt. This will be his biggest hit, it is inevitable. But once you surrender yourself to his exquisite madness, you're able to forget the fact that Ledger is gone and that the ghost on-screen is the last of what will remain.The only quibble I have about THE DARK KNIGHT is the recasting of the Rachel Dawes character. Katie Holmes got a lot of unfair publicity during BATMAN BEGINS because of the media firestorm around her relationship with Tom Cruise. She even got a Razzie nomination. She is not this generation's answer to Bette Davis, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is actually the better actress of the two. But having already set up this character who is very crucial to Bruce's life, it's awkward to have another actress cast in that role. It's like trying to imagine anyone else but Ingrid Bergman falling in love with Humphrey Bogart during the Paris flashbacks of CASABLANCA. However, the role, already small and somewhat insubstantial, is a more diminished in this film than its predecessor, and it's only a minor annoyance to a practically perfect movie.This is the film we've all been waiting for, and it's the film we deserve. I hope you all take in the unforgettably exciting atmosphere of the crowded theater, and remember the greatness of Heath Ledger that is lost, but with this film, it'll never be forgotten.","

"The Dark Knight","e-1529","30 August 2008","It's hard to find what is wrong with a movie that seems so well crafted and put together. Well let's start by saying that the Dark Knight is very boring and messy.The plot is incoherent, with too many undeveloped subplots. The movie tries to be realistic but logic has no place anywhere. It tries to be dramatic but the drama is manufactured, out of place, and doesn't build up from anything. Lots of poor philosophical monologues going nowhere. The characters have nothing, nothing interesting about them. They're like puppets used to create some sort of politicised view of the world where everyone is miserable with no sense of humor, taking no pleasure from their actions whatever they are. And creating this dull vision of the world hidden behind a comic superhero, is what this movie is all about. All the rest comes as a consequence of this. Anything that happens has little or no effect. Batman is just as hollow as every one else. You could swap him with some other character and nothing would change. Action is just average. Random things happening out of nowhere, and no explanations is given on how they managed to do that. Some great effects here and there don't add much to the movie. I like violent movies but the violence in the DK is pretty much senseless as well as censored. Definitely not for young kids.The movie is not dark, is hollow. If you want a good dark movie then go to see the awesome 'The Crow'. You want to see a good batman movie then watch the Tim Burton's version. Flat with no substance, humor or soul, the Dark Knight doesn't leave you with any emotions whatsoever, no hope and not even hopelessness. Only a lame sense of depression.","

"The Dark Knight","intp","17 February 2013","Just re-watched ""Dark Knight"" (2008), from the purchased Blu-Ray trilogy. I had rented this once years ago but had not seen it since then. My opinion about this movie has not changed. Sure, it was well done, but I still am mystified by the incredible adulation this movie gets.The single thing that I hated the most was the incredibly ridiculous, over-the-top effectiveness of the Joker. Come on. Even if he was connected like, say, someone in the Trust from 100 Bullets (a comic book reference), he couldn't have pulled off the grandiose schemes that he executes flawlessly again and again. Then, add on top of that, he's supposed be a psychopathic mad dog, and it becomes utter nonsense. ""World's greatest detective"" is transformed into guy desperately trying to stop someone who's so much better than he is that it's not even funny.Some of the basic themes of the movie were interesting and well done, like the idea of the Joker that everyone is just one bad day from being like him (the same basic theme in ""Killing Joke""). But really, if the Joker could pull the stunts he did in this movie, he could have had the entire country on its knees in days. Sheesh. Sorry, I just couldn't suspend my disbelief that far. Not only would one need to have incredibly meticulous planning, one would also need inconceivable resources, of the sort that a derelict like the Joker would never even come close to having.This bothered me so much that I just couldn't enjoy the movie.I agree, though, that Ledger's performance was quite amazing. He stole the show.I thought Batman Begins was very much the better movie. I haven't yet seen ""Dark Knight Rises"" so I'm hoping it's more in the vein of the first movie than the second.","

"The Dark Knight","bexandbarn","2 January 2009","What is going on with all of these maximum ratings for a barely average film? According to IMDb, this is the best film of the decade so far. Not one sane person could argue that this is justified. Have the studios finally managed to get the masses to 'believe the hype'? I was a bit skeptical about this film, due to the hype, and especially because I wasn't impressed with Batman Begins, but I must admit, the heist in the first five minutes was excellent, and I thought my skepticism was unwarranted. But then Batman turned up and began speaking like a wrestler with throat cancer, and it continued to go down hill from there. What I didn't expect this film to be was tedious. But it was. It was far too long and bored my pants off me. There was no character development, the story was convoluted and over-complex and it was far too long. But my my main problem, and this goes against nearly every reviewer here, even those who weren't impressed, I thought Heath Ledger was absolutely awful! Who are these people calling for a posthumous Oscar? There is nothing I despise more than a 'look at me' performance. Ledger did all the tricks required to portray a 'crazy guy', including shifting his eyes up, down, left and right at every opportunity, and ingeniously, due to having his mouth cut as a child, he keeps licking around the inside of his mouth, which rather than being an impressive feat of method acting is actually as irritating as watching a fat man eat chips with his mouth open. His performance was utterly self-indulgent and it seems like all you sycophants fell for it. The only decent acting performance in this film is Eckhart. Caine and Morgan bore, and Bale, with his 'employ me for movie trailers' voice barely has one dimension. I would have rated this film higher if it hadn't taken itself so seriously, but as it stands it is a pretentious hyped-up and tedious movie. At last, the dark truth.","

I mean I've always been a big Batman fan and I love Batman Begins and The Dark Knight Rises but The Dark Knight just didn't work for me even though it's often considered one of the greatest superhero movies ever. But I think people are giving it FAR too much credit. I mean IMDb users put it higher than such classics as The Lord of the Rings, Psycho, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Casablanca, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Rear Window and many more on the Top 250 list. That's just going too far!Okay, I'll admit that there are some really good things about the film such as Heath Ledger's performance. Of course, everyone thinks he was the best Joker. I mean before I saw The Dark Knight, I had never even heard of him, I didn't even know he had died even though he was a rising star with such films as Brokeback Mountain and I'm Not There. But I have to say he totally deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor even though some people make controversy about it. And the action scenes are really good too.But what I really don't like about this movie is that the plot isn't very subtle or coherent. I found some parts confusing and I'm surprised how overlooked the plot holes are. Also I was disappointed with Two- Face. I mean he wasn't in it for very long and it felt like he didn't really add anything to the story. He was just angry that his girlfriend Rachel died, he wasn't really suffering a mental illness, he just wanted to get revenge. Also I never liked Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel because she was weak and ugly and I think she didn't really fit the role. I preferred Katie Holmes. Also I think the film focused more on the Joker than Batman even though Ledger's Joker was excellent. But Batman is the main character. Maybe one of the reasons why this film gets so much hype and praise is because it was one of Heath Ledger's last films and they're being generous to it or he's the main reason why everyone loves it. But I personally think this film is very over-hyped and overrated. But even though I'm a huge Batman fan, I'll just stick to watching Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns and Nolan's Batman Begins and The Dark Knight Rises.","

How many conflicted characters, staring into the depths of their pompous souls? Visually - great. And the vfx crew have to be credited for some of the most seamless and impressive work ever done, on the city, the batmobile, the bat bike etc. Brilliant stuff.But the story, the script, the pacing - all pretty blaah.

Did I actually know what was going on half the time, what with the various criminals, their money, the money laundering guy, the Joker, the various Police Departments (what the hell is ""County""?). No, no, no. Boring. I was actually looking at my watch.The one intriguing episode in the film - with the ferries - is shoved in three quarters of the way through the film, and unceremoniously dumped once it has served its purpose in sticking other bits of the film together.So, all in all, I wish I'd spent the time some other way.","

"The Dark Knight","silentcheesedude","13 September 2008","From the desk of Warner Brothers Marketing department:Please note that the release of the new Batman movie we just completed already has plenty of fanfare behind it. Sadly, one of the actors can no longer partake in the new photo shoots and ads. Our job will be to catapult it above any other movie, and we have a plan for this, but first, let's discuss some things about the movie. I know not all of you have seen the movie in it's completion because, frankly, it's a mess. The editing department couldn't make heads or tails out of half the scenes before we had to involve the director to see what in the world was going on in his mind. So here it is in a nutshell:We all think it turned out to be an good action movie. It's story was fairly well constructed, with more going then just a simple superhero against the bad guy movie. Being better than 'Begins', you didn't have to go through the origins of Bruce Wayne, & instead focus on the meat of the story. And we like Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey. It all sounds great, but that's where the great ends.See, the movie just had to cluster another bad guy, Two-Face, into the movie an hour and 45 into it. It made for a tremendously long movie. In a movie like, say X-men, it's good to be long, since each character can share some interesting interaction for screen time. A movie like Batman should never clock more then 2 hours, yet at 152 minutes, Dark Knight over-stretches it's welcome. Scenes that just went on and on with conversations. Even during the movie, we knew editing could have been better, and some speeches between the characters were either redundant or overdone.The story even dwindles with the Joker, teasing us with past issues that could have been real but perhaps aren't. When Alfred said ""some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn."", he described Joker pretty well, and it was one of the best quotes in the movie. But the purpose of a good movie that has good vs. evil is that the bad guy has more depth then the good guy, in some cases, we fall in love with the bad guy and can almost seem to go along with him, if not his actions, then the ends to his means. Or perhaps the fallacies that we see in all of us, as scary as it seems to see that deep into ourselves how the 'evil' in some movies reflect that mean spirit in some of us represented with a social comment, like media or government. You can even compare a movie like V for Vendetta and you can begin to see what we mean.Batman may be the ultimate representation of a good guy with an 'attitude' that goes after criminals that seemingly have no agenda but to be out of their minds. He was grown and started as a creature during the depression, as a shining light against the evil corporations and government. We see it in the comic books. Dark Knight, however, will be a raging success, not because it makes a social commentary or deep character study, but because the general public eats up popular figures with action scenes that doesn't have to make us think, only try to fill in our desires of revenge with interesting technological gadgets.Here are some better movies: Better action: Matrix, Wanted, cheesy 80's sci fi movies, like Terminator Better story lines: Sin City, V for Vendetta, Seven Samurai Better Superheros with Attitudes: Wolverine, Hellboy, Conan, Lobo And of course, Better bad guys: Hannibal Lecter, Darth Vader, Anton Chigurh (from No Country For Old Men), hell we even like Kaiser Soze- Any of the above bad guys can have an entire book based on them. I can write a description of the Joker in one small paragraph.Another problem may be that Warner Brothers has put all their eggs into Batman, Superman notwithstanding. Marvel comics now owns the rights to superheroes on the screen, together with Iron Man, Hulk, & the upcoming Thor and Captain America. They have a vision for the big picture for the future of ""The Avengers"" in 2011 (?) That's a crap-load of heroes but if they play the cards easy, & it shouldn't be too hard, they will have a winning formula for future projects involving even more comic book heroes. But whereas Marvel was busy creating a production company to make business with many of the characters in the Marvel Universe, we.. well..Anyway, what we need you all to do... every single one of you, from the cameramen to the gaffer, is to sign up on places like IMDb and other movie sites, and give Batman a 10. Write up a review that shows none of the above, make sure you plug for emotional effect with the passing of our fine fellow actor, & make it seem like he deserves an Oscar.-WBMDPS: After the write ups and ratings boosts are done, come back to the premiere party next week for biscuits and coke!","

"The Dark Knight","RainDogJr","18 July 2008","When I was a kid I taped the first Tim Burton's Batman from TV and I have truly great memories with that film (and with that tape), a 1989 film that I haven't watch since long time ago. I felt and I still feel an enormous admiration for Jack Nicholson and I think his joker was great but since I saw for the very first time Heath Ledger with the joker makeup and suit, I just loved the new joker. Yesterday I read again (now in a newspaper) the declarations of Jack Nicholson about the ""new"" joker and his words are even kind of ridiculous, maybe he was joking when he said that he should have been playing this joker since he can be easily the father or even the grandfather of Bruce Wayne. Today I saw The Dark Knight, on a midnight ""special"" screening just for the record, and even I still have those great memories of Nicholson's joker, I really don't remember feeling in the same way that when I saw Ledger's joker on the screen; he is absolutely fantastic just like this second take on Christopher Nolan's Batman, the second take and definitely my favourite of all the Batman films. Ledger's joker is the kind of villain, or better, the kind of character that you are just waiting for his next appearance, just to enjoy his presence on the screen and to enjoy the great character that is the joker. Of course as the joker becomes a character that itself makes a film worthwhile, he becomes the puppeteer of Gotham City, playing with the mob as if they were little kids and making a brilliant movement after a brilliant movement (the opening sequence is more than fantastic). This time Batman is not the protagonist but he is for sure the only one in who the joker feels respect or at least some excitement and the joker knows that Batman changed forever Gotham City but at the same time he knows how to play with him by making that Gotham City itself put the pressure on the hero and in this way Harvey Dent (a terrific performance of Aaron Eckhart and for me it was a surprise to see him on this film since I only remember him from Thank You for Smoking) will play a very important role since he is the real and new hero of Gotham City but he will live a situation that will mark him forever and that makes the film works in another level. And the joker likes to play on that level and is intelligence is simply amazing. The are some situations that are memorable in the film; I loved that the joker's origin is never explain and it seems that he arrives just to pull the strings and maybe it was because of his father or maybe because of his wife (I loved at both dialogs), who knows and actually it is not very relevant. But all of this comes back when the joker tries to put on his level ""regular"" persons and he succeeded for example with a cop who is full of anger when the joker ask him how many of his friends have died because of his acts but his most important success is on Dent who will try to put James Gordon in his same previous situation. On this level The Dark Knight is great with a story involving the classic corruption, the hopeless madness, the honesty and the meaning of the word hero yet the action is also great and exciting, starting with a memorable sequence, as I write before, just to grab your attention and it takes Batman, in a strange move, even to Hong Kong! But as I write before too, the joker's movements are just to follow and even we you don't expect anything he puts to the civilians the clown masks, tied guns in their hands and leaves everything for a civilian massacre. To talk about Ledger himself is kind of unnecessary since just after his suicide his joker became a cult character and also because we can resume all the performances in this film with only one word: great (I didn't missed Holmes and I'm glad that Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman and, specially, Gary Oldman are here again).The hype was huge and actually this is the first and probably the unique summer film that has that mentioned special midnight screening, you know to start watching The Dark Knight in the first minute of the day of its release (for the record, this is the first time that I went to one of this midnight screenings and I found some curiosities like that people likes them, the cinema was full which was really awaited, and that there are no trailers, you know to start exactly at 00:00), and that was my strongest card for this 2008 summer. I'm more than glad to say that I really loved The Dark Knight and on a personal level, this is my favourite Batman film ever. Tim Burton gave us two great films but now, well actually back in 2005 Nolan re- bird Batman and that was truly fantastic but The Dark Knight is even more fantastic. Don't miss the chance to see this one on the big screen!","

"The Dark Knight","LouE15","12 May 2009","The last time I had to ask so many questions during a film was during incomprehensible existential timewaster ""Tron"" (so now you also know roughly how old I am!). Significant exceptions aside, this is the ""Tron"" of the modern-day blockbuster world. I emerged saying ""yeah, well"".I loved ""Batman Begins""; Christian Bale is my favourite Batman; and with this many great actors, it should have been a steal. Michael Caine in particular brings, with his briefest appearance on screen, a wonderful sense of comfort and pathos. But despite all this – despite a general tone suitable to a post-traumatic, mid-recession era – I was left entirely agreeing with a reviewer who described feeling unaccountably ""disconnected"" from the culture that spawned this film. The breathless adulation that some have heaped on the film has astonished me.I love dark things: I love film noir; and films of all sorts whose characters who struggle with their souls' messy urgings. But ""The Dark Knight"" is all dark looks and no urgings. Lots of reviewers have praised the 'dark Gotham' design: huh? It's modern-day New York in low light and with extra night thrown in! How is that brilliant? And the crime wave? You want a truly dark tone, watch ""Serpico"" or ""Blue Collar"". To make a really good action film about corruption, everyone – literally everyone – needs to be, or to seem, corrupt. How much more interesting would this film have been if Rachel, Alfred and Lucius Fox were under suspicion, or better still, actually corrupt and working against Batman? Or if Batman were found in his Penthouse by Rachel, curled up naked and whispering mad nothings like a Gotham Howard Hughes? Bale was half asleep, or may as well have been – what a waste of that intense face, his physicality! Ledger was very, very impressive, and this was his film – he would eventually have made the lists of the really great actors if he could have kept from doing rubbish films like ""Casanova"". The charismatic Maggie Gyllenhaal is a pleasant change but even she can't perform the magic trick of making a meaningful character from an underwritten part. I've seen the Batman back catalogue, but throughout this I kept asking: ""soshe knows that Bruce is Batman?"" ""soshe loves him but she's marrying someone else?"" ""so.she's known him all his life? Who IS she?"" I had no idea that this was the same girl Batman had brushed with in ""Begins"", so for me, there was no history, no connection, no tension. Everything got absorbed in the central, overstretched idea of Batman's inner darkness versus the Joker's chaos theory.Like the vision of purgatory that is Batman's temporary lair while Wayne Manor is being rebuilt, mostly I think this film is about nothing more or less than the state of being bored. Batman is bored of his dual lifestyles. The Joker is bored of playing all by himself, the only intelligent psychopath in Gotham. Harvey is bored of winning his not very interesting games of chance. Glass-and-steel Gotham is 1980s dull; crime, which is money, is boring – so boring that the Joker sets his money on fire. That party Bruce throws for Harvey – come on! – the most boring party on earth; Rachel's ""love"" triangle is the most boring love triangle ever. Maybe a different style altogether would have helped bring this spin on the story alive, such as comic animation in tune with the TV series, or hyper-stylised like ""Sin City"", which seems apt.It's absurd to imagine that this film – mere dark-toned spun sugar confection that it is – merits a place in any generation's top 100 list. Here's a revolutionary idea: how about NO more Batman, in this guise at least? Leave the superheroics in the capable hands of Iron Man and Hellboy and move on.","

"The Dark Knight","GoldmundX","4 August 2008","I'm pretty serious about this one because I love movies. And since this movie is being rated as the best movie of all time, I was expecting something that could measure itself with the great movies of all time. I expected a movie that grips you, crawls under your skin and leaves you breathless. It does none of that. It is pretentious and inconsistent. It pretends to dig deep and dark and explore themes like morality, fate, good versus evil, heart versus mind, madness versus reason, and at the same time it wants to be this big spectacular action movie. But it fails miserably. It's all just a big clumsy pretentious inconsistent mess.Yes, Ledger is good, but for his performance to really contribute to the movie, there should have been context. If the rest just doesn't feel right, it looses its potential. If you throw a diamond on a mountain of poop, it doesn't change much of the way it looks or smells. Love interest Maggie Gyllenhaal (great performance in Stranger than Fiction) produces no chemistry at all, so I wasn't really blown away when she was blown up. Editing feels weird. But most of all it was the inconsistencies that got to me. And then not just the 'practical' ones (like the inconsistent protective quality of the batman suit; or why leave an extremely dangerous criminal unrestrained with a tubby policeman in his cell ('hostage volunteer? you, tubby?'); a schoolbus is used twice to make a grand escape? - do they come with teleporter machines these days?; why would you want to ride your batmobile face down?; Batman lowers his voice to be unrecognizable, but how hard is it to follow a batmobile with a helicopter to its hiding place?), but more importantly it's crucial plot/ morality inconsistencies. Yes, the White Knight went through some traumatic experiences, but to turn to the dark side so wholeheartedly and sadistically? And then to just let the Joker (at least indirectly responsible for his trauma) walk when he only needs to pull the trigger? Oh yeah, forgot, he's Mr. Coin Toss now. But even if he is guided by blind fate now, he still determines himself who he goes after and whether it's OK to threaten to blow out the brains of little kids. And then the Big Bad criminal who throws the detonator out off the window. Ah! The Joke is on you Joker! People are not what you make them out to be. Even the baddest bad ass has a good heart. Never mind that just before when the Joker threatened to blow up a hospital unless an innocent lawyer was killed, there was a crowd with guns ready to shoot the guy within no time. Also, what with the vote on the 'good people boat'? They vote to blow up the 'bad people' (democracy at its finest) but then Nobody has the balls to do it? So they don't blow up the other boat because they think it's unjust, but because they're spineless hypocrites.I applaud movies that try and deal with complex issues like conflicting emotions or morals, but to just make a big soup of it all under the pretense of 'but that's how life works, it's conflicting ideas, feelings and actions' is just a weak excuse for the inability or laziness to produce a good consistent story. Believe me, I detest black and white thinking and applaud the exploration of the Grey area. But that's not what this movie does. Piling a bunch of random inconsistent ideas on top of each other is not equal to exploring the Grey area.The climax is the ending though (it usually is). Our dark knight has to sacrifice himself, has to live like a hunted animal in the shadow, because the People would not be able to cope with the idea of Denth doing bad things, despite his recent traumas. So it's better to LIE to the public, because they are too stupid to make up their own mind and their faith in goodness of man would be lost forever (despite the fact that they just tried to establish with the boat-thing that there's goodness even in big bad criminals). So Batman (whose enemies take advantage of the fact that he doesn't kill) takes the blame for a bunch of random killings that could have been linked to anyone - a Joker perhaps? (even if they wanted to absolve Denth from his crimes -I mean, evidence/motive would have been needed to link it to Batman too?) and goes off running ('run Forrest!') into the night to save us another day. Because you just can't trust people to make up their own mind, it's better to lie to them. It's for their own good. Great morale. Straight from the White House? But ey, why so serious?","

"The Dark Knight","Chiyonosake23","1 February 2010","First of all things i should say i am a comic-book fan. From Eastern Europe. Why is this important? Because here its something really different then in the USA. In the USA comic-books are part of the everyday life. Here it is not. Here it is an underrated genre, and most of the people still think it is something sissy for small children and contains only fighting and dialogue no higher level then Kapow and Boom-Boom. And it was even worse when i was little. It was always a little treasure hunt to get some. And most of them was bad rip-off, cheap junk from the above mentioned category, and it was only Batman, who continually represented quality and was available for a kid like me too. And i was amused and loved it. Not Batman in the first place, but the amazing villains. And especially Joker. He was the best of the best. Maybe the most complex, interesting and remarkable character ever created.And to tell the truth, i wasn't entirely satisfied with either one of the Batman films made up to the Dark Knight. Especially considering that there was an absolutely brilliant animated series: Batman the Animated Series, check it out if you like Batman, well worth it. They first 3 movies were okay, but the Batman and Robin and Batman Begins both sucked big time, but for different reasons. I lost hope i will ever see a really good and faithful adaptation of this comic. Then along came this one.Yes it has some overdone parts, some flaws here and there, a bit rushed and corny ending, but its good, meaningful, and Heath Ledger (who i disliked before i saw this) is the absolutely perfect Joker. When i saw the casting, i thought it is a disgrace. After i saw the movie i thought he was unearthly good. The film has suspense, great acting, emotions, and a very interesting and coherent plot which is very rare in Hollywood blockbusters. Well worth watching for anyone and everyone. Especially for people, who think comic-books are sissy things for little children...","

"The Dark Knight","bigben5","28 July 2008","C'mon folks, you call this movie a masterpiece? The greatest movie of all-time? Sheesh, I thought people had higher standards than this.The only reason why people went to see this movie is because it was Heath Ledger's last performance. And boy, does he deliver! But is it really worthy of an Oscar? Well, that depends on how you interpret The Joker.To be fair, there is no right way to interpret The Joker. His past is just as mysterious as his motivation. But how can you create a character with absolutely no history and expect him to be believable? In the comics, his name was Jack Napier, a thug/ comedian who fell into a bath of chemicals that bleached his skin as white as snow. He had only one motivation for all the mayham he caused -- to amuse himself. This back story, that I've just given you, makes the villain far more credible than he was in the film. Even Charles Manson, one of the greatest killers of all- time, had a motivation for killing that made sense to him, but in this film we are never given any insight as to what this might be.Okay, so I have no problem with Heath Ledger winning an Oscar here. Then why did this movie suck? Because it was created for shock value instead of for entertainment. This movie has no plot. ""The Joker wrecks havoc on Gotham,"" is pretty much the only storyline you get. There are cars blowing up, people blowing up, people screaming blue murder and other bits of mayhem that make as much a sense as people screaming for mercy in a Godzilla film. Did Batman really have to fly all the way to Hong Kong to capture a corrupt banker or was that a ploy from the Chinese government to showcase the area for the 2008 Olympics? Why can't Christian Bale fight after all this time? Do you think those people on the boat would have talked things out in a ""civilized"" manner with the bombs about to explode? Me thinks pandemonium would have ensued, and that in the real world they would have dead in 10 seconds flat. Can you really set 30 million cell phones off to find one person? I think the writers wrote themselves into a corner on that one.Another thing that bugs me about this film is Two-face. The movie doesn't give lip-service to his love for duality at all. He just wakes up and goes ""Gee, I have a burnt face. May as well use it for scaring kids,"" and runs off plugging people, serving up his own brand of justice. To say that he was a hero was laughable, as people serve up their own brand of justice all the time. All you need to do is walk down the wrong alley at the wrong time to see what I mean.Overall, this film was terrible. Christian Nolan's vision of creating a modern Batman kills the whimsical charm and poetic lyricism established in the earlier movies directed by Tim Burton. Besides, Danny Elfman's theme will always be the defining music of the Dark Knight. By the way, what ever happened to the Bat Cave? They should never have taken that out.","

"The Dark Knight","Dr_Coulardeau","15 August 2008","CHRISTOPHER NOLAN - CHRISTIAN BALE - THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY - BATMAN BEGINS - 2005 - THE DARK KNIGHT - 2008 - THE DARK KNIGHT RISES - 2012A trilogy is magical because the number three is the most dynamic and human number that concentrates our minds, in any culture whatsoever, on what the future is going to be, what's next in our life, and what fate, karma, and destiny is bringing to us. Any ternary structure is the pattern of life par excellence, by basic natural law, edict, and rule.But a trilogy has to bring the story to an end, and in this case, since we are dealing with a fictional character the trilogy has to bring him from the beginning to the end, and his end has to be his death in some heroic way, and his becoming a symbol of the community, here Gotham, and a celebration of his final courage that brought him death and eternal fame, hence a statue in some main square of Gotham.But I am not going to write a necrological note on this dark knight, Bruce Wayne to be clear. I am just going to make a couple of remarks. One thing is sure the Joker has been a difficult revisiting exercise. After the phenomenal interpretation of the Character the first or nearly first time he appeared because of the actor who played the part, I mean Jack Nicholson in the 1989 production, and that revisiting exercise was so difficult that it did not appear in the last film of the trilogy and was replaced by some more complex character, Bane, who is masked too but to cover some disfigurement of his lower face, and who brings back the origin of Batman, the training of the young man he was when hardly of age, the moral, mental, and physical transformation in the hands of some guru or mental super-human entity and ""essence"" that anyone can develop with a lot of will power and an enormous amount of blind faith. But that does not regenerate the theme, the story. That makes it different in the main evil character, the destroyer of Gotham. And what we know was to happen actually happens: the city is saved by the human sacrifice of Batman, the Dark Knight, like some new Jesus Christ. Banal and maybe unspectacular, definitely uncreative. The end is a rewriting of the crucifixion of Jesus, but a self-crucifixion imposed by the total rejection of his heroic dimension by the people of Gotham, at least the top brass of the police and political forces there.Can we get any positive conclusion there? I may say no, resolutely no, absolutely no. Nothing new that politics creates corruption and corruption is the fuel politics works on. And we all know that power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. I learned that when I was not yet of age, when I was a teenager and not a very well-advanced teenager in age. The idea that a private company can be the savior of the community because they have money and it all depends on who is responsible for its use, is a very naïve idea. Look at Twitter and Elon Musk, banning some journalists because they dared to follow his private jet, a great polluter that can be replaced today by simple videoconferences, and this very same Elon Musk then stepping back in front of the outrage and reinstating the journalists hardly two days later. Pathetic. Some of the rich can have some ethics, but the future of the world should not depend on the power and will of a dozen people who have corporate money or state money at their disposal. This goes against anything like democracy. But we need some leaders, don't we? Sure, we do, but not leaders who go around hiding their identities behind a mask. That's a caricature of anything human but it impresses in the minds of children for their whole life thereafter, such ideas that the best politician and the best rich man is someone who advances anonymously and masked. Life is not a masked ball in some Italian Renaissance corrupted and criminal noble families like the Borgias.But the special effects are fine, the battles are nice, and the action is fascinating enough, though we always know that the end will be the end of evil and the triumph of the masked Batman. So, we just follow the peripeteias and hope they will be surprising and creative. They are, more or less, though the atomic ending is extremely trite.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAUVERSION FRANÇAISEUne trilogie est magique parce que le chiffre trois est le chiffre le plus dynamique et le plus humain qui concentre nos esprits, dans quelque culture que ce soit, sur ce que sera l'avenir, sur ce que sera la suite de notre vie et sur ce que le sort, le karma et le destin nous réservent. Toute structure ternaire est le modèle de vie par excellence, par loi naturelle fondamentale, par édit et par règle.Mais une trilogie doit mettre fin à l'histoire, et dans ce cas, puisque nous avons affaire à un personnage de fiction, la trilogie doit le mener du début à la fin, et sa fin doit être sa mort d'une manière héroïque, et le fait qu'il devienne un symbole de la communauté, ici Gotham, et une célébration de son courage final qui lui a apporté la mort et la gloire éternelle, d'où une statue sur une place principale de Gotham.Mais je ne vais pas écrire une note nécrologique sur ce chevalier noir, Bruce Wayne pour être clair. Je vais juste faire quelques remarques. Une chose est sûre, le Joker a été un exercice de revisitation difficile. Après l'interprétation phénoménale du personnage lors de sa première ou presque première apparition grâce à l'acteur qui jouait le rôle, je veux dire Jack Nicholson dans la production de 1989, cet exercice de revisitation a été si difficile qu'il n'est pas apparu dans le dernier film de la trilogie et a été remplacé par un personnage plus complexe, Bane, qui est masqué lui aussi, mais pour couvrir une défiguration du bas de son visage, et qui nous ramène à l'origine de Batman, à la formation du jeune homme qui était à peine majeur, à la transformation morale, mentale et physique entre les mains d'un gourou ou d'une entité mentale surhumaine et d'une ""essence"" que n'importe qui peut développer avec beaucoup de volonté et une énorme quantité de foi aveugle. Mais cela ne régénère pas le thème, l'histoire. Cela rend différent le personnage principal maléfique, le destructeur de Gotham. Et ce que nous savions qui allait se passer se produit réellement : la ville est sauvée par le sacrifice humain de Batman, le Chevalier Noir, comme un nouveau Jésus-Christ. Banal et peut-être peu spectaculaire, définitivement peu créatif. La fin est une réécriture de la crucifixion de Jésus, mais une auto-crucifixion imposée par le rejet total de sa dimension héroïque par les habitants de Gotham, du moins les hauts gradés de la police et des forces politiques.Peut-on en tirer une conclusion positive ? Je ne peux dire que non, résolument non, absolument non. Il n'est pas nouveau que la politique crée la corruption et que la corruption soit le carburant de la politique. Et nous savons tous que le pouvoir corrompt, et que le pouvoir absolu corrompt absolument. J'ai appris cela alors que je n'étais pas encore majeure, que j'étais un adolescent et pas un adolescent très avancée en âge. L'idée qu'une entreprise privée puisse être le sauveur de la communauté parce qu'elle a de l'argent et que tout dépend de qui est responsable de son utilisation, est une idée très naïve. Regardez Twitter et Elon Musk, qui a banni certains journalistes parce qu'ils avaient osé suivre son jet privé, un grand pollueur qui peut être remplacé aujourd'hui par de simples vidéoconférences, et ce même Elon Musk a ensuite reculé devant l'indignation et réintégré les journalistes à peine deux jours plus tard. Pathétique. Certains riches peuvent avoir une certaine éthique, mais l'avenir du monde ne devrait pas dépendre du pouvoir et de la volonté d'une douzaine de personnes qui disposent de l'argent des entreprises ou de l'État. Cela va à l'encontre de tout ce qui ressemble à la démocratie. Mais nous avons besoin de leaders, n'est-il point ? Bien sûr que oui, mais pas de leaders qui paradent en cachant leur identité derrière un masque. C'est une caricature de toute chose humaine mais cela imprime dans l'esprit des enfants pour toute leur vie par la suite, de telles idées que le meilleur politicien et le meilleur homme riche est quelqu'un qui avance anonymement et masqué. La vie n'est pas un bal masqué dans certaines familles nobles corrompues et criminelles de la Renaissance italienne comme les Borgia.Mais les effets spéciaux sont bons, les batailles sont belles, et l'action est assez fascinante, bien que nous sachions toujours que la fin sera la fin du mal et le triomphe du Batman masqué. Alors, on se contente de suivre les péripéties en espérant qu'elles soient surprenantes et créatives. Elles le sont, plus ou moins, bien que la fin atomique soit extrêmement banale.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU.","

It didn't look like something created by a rich man like Bruce Wayne. I liked the performance of Eric Roberts as well as Heath Ledgers. I believe the last batman was better. 7/10as a followup on this day Aug 30th, 2011, I have watched the movie a few more times and YES it is a GREAT movie! If grew on me and even after I met Gary Oldman at a high-school football game and commented on how well this movie plays on repeated viewings because the acting is so good, he agreed. Heath was brilliant and the movie does work on many levels! I rescind my previous review!","

"The Dark Knight","HotToastyRag","23 November 2017","In Christopher Nolan's darker reboot of the Batman franchise, Christian Bale plays the masked hero. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine join the cast as regulars, with guest stars in each installment as villains or temporary females. I watched the previews for these films and never had any desire to watch them. To me, Michael Keaton is Batman, and no remake can ever compare. My brother practically forced me to watch The Dark Knight, after Heath Ledger won his posthumous Oscar, and even though he raved and raved, I remained unimpressed. To me, the Batman films aren't supposed to be that dark and disturbing. Batman originated in a comic book, and should therefore be accessible to children. Nolan's imagination of Gotham City does not keep in view of the original comic or previous adaptations. It has the same feel of the types of films that specialize in serial killers.My brother raved about Christian Bale's American accent. I'd heard him show his talent at accents in other films, so this gravelly-voiced performance didn't terribly impress me. The villains—Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face, Heath Ledger as The Joker, and Cillian Murphy as The Scarecrow—were needlessly frightening and relied on gimmicks rather than acting. Heath Ledger's untimely death was extremely tragic, but his performance in this film didn't warrant a nomination, let alone an Oscar win. He had a lot of makeup on, spoke in a different accent, and flicked his tongue in and out so audiences would think he's insane. The tongue flick is as old a trick in the book as it is to chew gum when playing a bimbo.There are extended action sequences that showcase vast special effects, so if you only watch movies based on how impressive the special effects are, you will probably want to rent this one. And, to be honest, younger audiences will probably really enjoy the reboot of the series. They didn't grow up watching it as originally intended, and today's audiences have short attention spans that need to be sensationalized every few minutes. Older folks who liked the Michael Keaton movies should stay far away from these.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to scary and upsetting images, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.","

"The Dark Knight","pinkliz41","5 August 2008","Films like these don't come along very often. Perfect acting, directing, music, characters, story, cinematography and so on. To me The Dark Knight is one of those examples that will be remembered for a very long time to come. Everything that has been said about how wonderful this film is is true.The action is massive and beyond epic. But in-between the high flying punches and explosions its the acting that sums up this mastery. All the actors prove their worth as masters of their profession.Christian Bale has characterised the greatest Batman ever. His portrayal as Batman is brilliant and we finally witness this characters struggles, ambitions and morales all onto screen for the first time.Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker is so chilling and monumental, menacing and pure that no other actor could had pulled that off. His presence on screen lights up and your left with, what i consider to be the greatest performance by any actor.To conclude, The Dark Knight is a perfect film. Perfect in a sense that i think has never been seen before and that wont ever be seen again.R.I.P Heath Ledger","

"The Dark Knight","The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","19 July 2008","In short, The Dark Knight is everything any Batfan could have dreamed of. It is the best of 2008, the best comic book film of all time, and one of the greatest action films ever made. It is carried by the titanic performances of Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart, and stands for more than it seems on the surface, much like its hero.To be honest, I really don't know where to begin. The film has NO flaw as far as I can see (although Bale's take on Batman's voice was noticeably more annoying here, maybe because he spent more time in the suit than he did last time). Christopher Nolan's craft and aptitude for understanding this story...the Batman archetype...is unparalleled. This is not just a comic book film. It's a story of what will happen when you leave the race of men no choice. It's a story of what will happen when desperation takes over the souls and minds of all. And lastly, it's a story of how a man's bond and love for his city affects him. This film is going to undoubtedly going to end up as my favorite film of 2008, and is the only film this year so far to receive a 10 out of 10 rating from me.I know you're all itching to see what I think of the acting, so without further ado, let's go there. Though this is a Batman film, the film is not about Batman...it's about Harvey Dent. It's about his struggle, his pain, his life...and there is no greater actor to play the part than Mr. Aaron Eckhart. An admirable performance saves the film from being too lopsided in the favor of a certain clownish psychopath. Eckhart's show is deep, riveting, and when he inevitably becomes Two Face, emotionally disturbing and destructive. Definitely the most surprising show of the film. Christian Bale's take on Batman...well, I never thought I'd say this, but he didn't actually improve on anything here. It's not in Bale's top 5 as far as performances go, and I got a bit of a wooden vibe from him occasionally. Overall, however he is good enough to the point where he isn't completely overshadowed. The next best show would be from Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. He really is the only truly good character in the movie, and Oldman's immediate warmth and likability make his show a great one. I enjoyed brief cameos from Cillian Murphy, Bill Fichtner, and Michael Jai White, as well as the performances of Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman (although, like Bale, it's more of the same).I think I'm forgetting someone...OH YEAH! Maggie Gyllenhaal totally erased the memory of Katie Holmes from my mind. Gyllenhaal was excellent as both the fierce and dedicated ADA Rachel Dawes, and the fragile love interest of Bruce and Harvey. Great all around.I still can't help but feel as if I've forgotten something...The action in this film...well, needless to say, it's jaw dropping. Though there was less emphasis on the hand to hand fighting and more on the big bang booms, it was more than understandable because the villains are not as skilled of fighters as our dear Batman is. The film refuses to relent, and borders on horror-like territory numerous times in the film. Despite the length, I never found myself bored or wanting it to end. On the contrary, I was sort of hoping that Heath Ledger would never leave the screen.Oh...THAT'S what I forgot...Ladies and gentlemen, here's the night's entertainment. Without the titanic, terrifying, riveting, and masterful performance of Heath Ledger as The Joker, this film sinks. The film rides on the shoulders of Batman's arch-nemesis, and Ledger takes it and runs away with it. I have trouble finding words to describe how Ledger's Joker made me feel both as I was watching and after. To put it simple, and I'm not lying, Ledger had me shaking for hours after the credits rolled. His voice, his posture, his delivery, his demeanor...all of it makes for the best villainous performance since Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs, and arguably the best villainous performance of all time. Though the viewer hates The Joker with every fiber of themselves, you can't help but be in awe of the mesmerizing show put on by Mr. Ledger. You won't be able to take your eyes off of him.A battle between good and evil doesn't describe the tension between Joker and Batman...it's more like a battle of completely opposite ideals. The Joker, who reigns and revels in anarchy, and Batman, who aims for order and planned course of action. I've never seen a better realization of the relationship between these two comic book titans. However, let us not forget that this movie is more about Harvey Dent than the others, and that most of Joker's actions revolve around Dent's actions, not Batman's. In fact, Joker reminds us that Batman is actually an obstacle to get to Dent.Really, I don't know where to end this review, so I think this is a good place. The Dark Knight is everything any cinemagoer could hope for, and more than anything a Batfan could ever dream of. Though the ending will certainly be controversial amongst Batfans, I don't think it could have ended any other way. Packed with extreme action, a bajillion plot twists, and the most terrifying performance in years make for the best film of 2008, and possibly one of the best of all time. The Dark Knight is perfect film-making, and I plan on seeing it at least 3 more times before it leaves theaters.Oh, and it goes without saying that Ledger deserves an Oscar win for this film.","

"The Dark Knight","zofos","22 August 2008","I thought ""Batman Begins"" was the best Batman movie of them all when I saw it and I still think that. It was the first Batman movie to fully explore how Bruce Wayne became Batman by showing his training by a mentor (Liam Neeson) and it made you fully appreciate what he was trying to achieve by turning fear back on the evil-doers. Even without the big Batman villains of The Joker, The Penguin and Catwoman, the makers of ""Batman Begins"" managed to do something new and different with an old character. It ended with a reference to the arrival of The Joker in Gotham City and it set the pulses racing with anticipation.Heath Ledger's casting as The Joker did raise some eyebrows, he wasn't an obvious choice and hadn't previously shown any of the manic energy necessary to play the Clown Prince of Gotham. While the calls (or demands more like) for an Oscar for Heath Ledger for his performance here are stretching things, he does bring an interesting energy to the performance. Jack Nicholson really nailed the character of The Joker, so it was going to be hard for anyone to live up to that. I guess Ledger did as good as anyone could have expected.The action scenes in ""The Dark Knight"" are spectacular and they are the best thing about the film. The real problem is the script. Christopher Nolan brought his brother on board as screenwriter, he hadn't been involved in the first film and it shows. The script is too long, we could have easily done without Harvey Dent/Two-Face in it (although the make-up effects on this character are excellent). If you cut his character out, you'd have a much more streamlined movie.Heath Ledger was never a comic actor and Christopher Nolan's movies aren't known for their humour either and that's another problem here. The Joker's funniest scenes are in the hospital when he goes to visit Harvey Dent. Dressed up as a nurse with a red wig, the only dialogue the writers can think of for The Joker to say is: ""Hi."" (Couldn't they have thought of something funnier than that?) Then, when the Joker blows up the hospital by remote control detonation, you keep waiting for the funny lines to come, but they never do. There are constant silences where there should be one-liners. Jack Nicholson had some tremendous quips as The Joker in Tim Burton's ""Batman,"" Heath Ledger never really gets the same service from the screenwriters. That's a pity.After 9/11, many new security measures were brought in and some of them lead to protests about invasion of people's privacy. There is a scene is this movie that mirrors that when Batman uses the cellular phones of the people of Gotham to track The Joker through sonar (it's also the visual equivalent of the hallucogenic scenes at the end of ""Batman Begins""). Morgan Freeman's character, Lucius Fox, proffers his resignation rather than ""spy on 30 million people."" It's a clever scene and it elevates The Joker's attacks on Gotham into a context we can all relate to, unfortunately it's only a brief moment in a very long movie and the rest of the film isn't as clever.Christian Bale seems to be growling his lines even more as Batman here than he did in the first film and it does get a little irritating at times. He's also not as buffed up as he was in the first one. The character development of Bruce Wayne that was so interesting in the first one grinds to a halt in this film. We find out precious little about him here, that goes for The Joker too and I feel the film suffers as result.Michael Caine returns as Alfred, but he doesn't have much to do this time around. The same goes for Morgan Freeman. The cast doesn't feel as special this time even though it's the same people all over again.Overall, this doesn't have the tight structure of ""Batman Begins"", it feels bloated and could have been fixed. It's just one robbery, kidnapping or car chase after another and it does start to get repetitive after a while. I hope the next Batman sequel is more in line with ""Batman Begins"" than this one.","

"The Dark Knight","funkyfry","24 July 2008","Batman (Christian Bale) hits the streets again with his most famous foe, the Joker (Heath Ledger) as his foe. Where the first film in Nolan's new series expressed basically the problems with Batman's double life, this new film focuses (to whatever it extent the film can be said to have focus) on the effect that he has on the criminals themselves and the culture of ""Gotham City."" The most successful and surprising aspect of the film is the way that it truly makes the audience believe by the end that anything could happen (i.e. one of Gordon's kids could really die), as opposed to most superhero movies where the outcome eventually becomes obvious if not tedious. Ledger's performance is also a huge factor in the film's quality. He's really scary, not over the top at all in a bad way.My problems with the film remain some of the same problems from ""Batman Begins."" I think Bale is sort of a dull Batman, primarily because he's not really convincing as Bruce Wayne. Specifically his version of Bruce Wayne is so cool and composed that it would seem obvious to everyone that he's Batman, whereas Michael Keaton for example seemed like such a doofus at times in the Bruce Wayne persona that you could believe that people would assume he was too much of a dilettante even if they did suspect him a bit. Believability is strained, even within the context of a superhero film, when Wayne slips away from his party and then moments later replaced by Batman, and yet nobody suspects.One thing I also liked about the Burton films was that Nicholson's Joker was both funny and terrifying, whereas I noticed all the jokes that Nolan tried to pull with Ledger's Joker came off flat. The dark atmosphere of the film is so unrelenting that the audience does not really feel inclined to laugh, and that produces an effect that dulls the overall edge of the action scenes. I tend to prefer superhero films that take themselves less seriously, yet this one was so well done in its own style that I would actually rate it higher than ""Iron Man"" for example despite the fact that the latter was actually more my type of movie. You just can't ask me to take crimefighters in capes and armored suits seriously for 2 plus hours, but this movie actually came amazingly close.Halfway through the movie I was thinking that it really wasn't any better than ""Batman Begins"" which I thought was somewhat mediocre, but then Ledger's performance really hits the high gear. I loved the dialog scene between Joker and Two-Face (Aaron Eckhart) in the hospital and the bit with him walking out. Also Batman and Joker in the interrogation room was a very strong scene. The really scary possibility that Ledger's performance raises is the possibility, perhaps only glimpsed, that the Joker might actually be more sane than Batman or even more sane than the average ""civilized"" person. ""I'm just ahead of the curve"" he says, and we almost want to believe him. These ""supervillains"" spring from essentially the fertile ground of Lon Chaney's performances in films such as ""The Penalty"" in 1919, where he was a legless criminal mastermind who wanted revenge on the entire city of San Francisco -- yet Ledger takes it to still another level by doing an irrational, anarchic take on the idea. He actually recites various versions of his invented ""backstory"" to his victims as if to mock their desire to contextualize his behavior through some rational explanation i.e. ""my father beat me"", ""my mother didn't love me."" The concept of revenge or even psychological compensation is just another joke to him. If indeed he is ""insane"", his ego will not allow him such a luxury and his very purpose seems to be to deny us the consolation of a rational or formulaic explanation for his brutality.I wasn't disappointed with the film at all -- this is basically as good as this type of thing gets. It wasn't a truly great film like Nolan's ""The Prestige"", but I didn't really expect it to be. I did notice some of Nolan's trademarks like the repetition of certain sounds and images in different contexts. I'm very excited by the possibilities for Nolan's next couple movies because this one is such a big hit that he basically has a blank check.","

"The Dark Knight","bradenmueller","10 February 2024","""The Dark Knight,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, stands as a towering achievement in the superhero genre, blending a compelling narrative with thematic complexity and technical mastery. The film's narrative structure is intricate and well-paced, intertwining multiple storylines without losing focus on its central theme: the battle between chaos and order. Nolan's direction, combined with Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer's screenplay, creates a Gotham City that feels real and fraught with moral ambiguity, a far cry from the typical black-and-white morality often seen in superhero films.Thematically, ""The Dark Knight"" delves deep into the psyche of its characters, particularly the juxtaposition between Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger's performance is a standout, bringing a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character. The film explores the cost of heroism and the fine line between hero and vigilante. It raises questions about justice, the nature of evil, and the sacrifices necessary to combat it, making the audience ponder long after the credits roll.Technically, the film is a marvel. Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grittiness of Gotham, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, and the use of practical effects over CGI adds to the film's realism.As the film progresses, one can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and their struggles. The moral dilemmas faced by Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and even Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) are portrayed with such depth that they resonate on a personal level. The ending, without revealing any spoilers, is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.In conclusion, ""The Dark Knight"" is not just a great superhero movie; it is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. It offers a complex narrative, deep thematic elements, and technical brilliance, coupled with stellar performances, especially by Heath Ledger. I rate it a solid 9.5 out of 10. It's a film that engages both the mind and the heart, providing an experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.","

"The Dark Knight","coldwaterpdh","21 January 2009","The excellent score, big money actors, impressive computer generated graphics and the death of Heath Ledger have obviously landed this film into a spot where, frankly in today's trendy, hype-loving, Hollywood-idealizing society, it squarely belongs. The fact that this film is number FIVE on the IMDb top 250...now that says a lot about who uses this website nowadays.Christian Bale's performance is unmemorable. His 'Batman' voice is over-produced and doubled-up to sound more superhero-ish. Maggie Gyllenhal is hardly acceptable as the film's 'belle' whom Aaron Eckhart and Mr. Bale both adore and long for. She isn't that great. (sorry Maggie!!!) Michael Caine seems bored with the whole project. The best actors are Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman who don't need a big budget mess like ""The Dark Knight"" to validate them as actors. Michael Keaton made a better Batman than Christian Bale. And now, I, The Lone Biker of the Apocalypse will spill the beans and skate on a sacrilegious razor blade: Jack Nicholson made a better Joker than Heath Ledger.By about an hour and a half in, I was looking at the clock, wondering when it would end. There are more twists and turns than a full season of ""General Hospital,"" so many it hurts your neck to watch it. It comes across as being a jumbled mess in the end. Harvey Dent's fall from grace is so predictable you'd have to be a middle school student not to see it coming. And why the hell did they keep referring to Batman as 'The Batman?' That was just annoying.After all, I guess it was middle schoolers who have been on here giving this movie TEN stars. To say it was bad would be silly, but let me be frank: I am taking away 4 points just because I'm irritated at how overrated this movie is! To all you guys who told me 'you have to see this in the theater, it's the greatest movie ever made!' be thankful I was too busy last summer because I'd be coming after you for my ten bucks.3 out of 10, kids.","

The obvious problems:* Too long!* Shallow stabs at moral seriousness.* Absurdly over-processed Batman voice.* The usual barely-there female characters.* Heath's Joker was just another lunatic villain, and we've seen plenty of similar quality over the years. *gasp*  heresy!Yes, in my opinion, Heath was merely okay.Making a villainous virtue out of the Joker having no purpose but to ""make the world burn"" is not ""deep."" It's not that hard to create a charismatic psycho character. Yes, he had some game. Yes, of course, I enjoyed lines like ""I wouldn't know what to do with it if I caught one."" This movie wasn't completely awful. I'm giving it five stars, after all (which guarantees no one will read my comment, but oh well).But neither Heath nor the film as a whole was ""amazing.""I'm not a superhero movie hater, and I've actually read plenty of Batman comics in my life (unlike at least half the people getting excited about this film, I think). But I have been bored and disappointed by the Batman franchise films every time, so this is no surprise. I can't even wrap my head around this one being fun, light entertainment (or any other kind of entertainment), let alone a ""classic"" as so many are calling it.A classic?

"The Dark Knight","corrinadylan","2 December 2008","Admittedly, Christopher Nolan has been incredibly successful at what I would consider a doomed endeavor. After all, what sane director would try to fashion a realistic, rational universe from a sophomoric fantasy about a self-indulgent playboy with a costume fetish and a penchant for stylized bedlam? Still, I find the Batman premise more palatable when overshadowed by the fun spectacle of carnival freaks, kitschy art, and psychedelically rendered pulp lore. Without such accoutrements, the story largely relies on the poignant characterization of caricaturesa difficult task, to be sure. At times, Nolan tries to circumvent the problem by turning The Dark Knight into a didactic meditation on terrorism or a vehicle for its catch phrase, ""You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain."" However, terrorism loses its contemporary salience when exploited for plot and entertainment purposes, and Nolan seems reluctant to subject his protagonist to the implications of a dubious aphorism or to explore adequately the transformation of his less fortunate foil, Harvey Dent. Because each character serves as a mouthpiece for Nolan's ideas rather than a living manifestation of his themes, even a cast of capable actors cannot save some of the more unconvincing scenes. In the film's best moments, the camera lingers over a face or a cityscape and allows the image to transcend the script. Sadly, such moments are few and far between. Nolan reminds us that the Batman legend will always fail as social commentary because it focuses on allegorical, larger-than-life individuals while relegating the masses to cowering factions of homogenized corruption, selfishness, or ineptitude. Such a perspective underestimates humanity, which is lost in the frenetic whirl of action sequences on screen.","

"The Dark Knight","Brawl_666","6 April 2009","A touch of reality is much-needed for those who of late have occupied themselves in tossing about bon-mots like ""masterpiece"" and ""crime-epic"". Perhaps never before have the expectations of rabid fanboys so completely bullied the critics into sheer lying. For lying it must be, since I refuse to believe that the critics did not see through this. It is just not possible. I feel that most of them simply cowed down before the staggering pre-release fanboy blitzkrieg, rather than provoke the inevitable backlash of acrimony from fans and thereby needlessly risk their careers. This is the only explanation I can conceive of as to why TDK has seemingly scored so well with the critics. I don't blame the critics, though. The blame lies in the fanboys' hysteria : their myopic refusal to see the obvious.I feel that Chris Nolan tried really really hard to make a good film, but ultimately even he with all his skill cant do much simply because of the limitations of the genre. If viewers truly want ""more realism"" as they say they do, then why turn to comics in the first place ?? Its just amazing how comic-book junkies pull the wool over their own eyes and deceive themselves into thinking that what they read is deep and sophisticated, when in fact (and there cannot be two opinions on this) reading comics beyond a certain age is a sign of neurotic behaviour. And before you shove it in my face that it is ME who is taking it too seriously, let me just say that this movie was nothing but lashes of violence : grim, sadistic violence. Once again, the so-called realism is simply a pretext for the usual action-movie gang-banging, i.e. violence and special effects. And its not even just because of the genre : Batman Begins rose above those limitations, right ? One could empathize with the young Bruce Wayne, tormented by his perceived culpability in his parents' murder, and struggling with his anger and loneliness. Not so in TDK : here there is neither plot nor motivation to speak of, and not a single character with whom one can even remotely identify. The acting, apart from one notable performance, is mediocre. To be fair, the film does take certain risks which I cant imagine the likes of, say, a Sam Raimi ever taking ; it isn't a McDonaldized blockbuster to the degree that the Spiderman films and the rest of the comic-book parade are. The problem is that those risks don't pay off : instead of an even progression of events that build up to a crescendo, what you get here is one absurdity after another until you are numb and it no longer matters who is doing what.I wonder if it is really so hard to tell the truth, even only to oneself. Apparently it is indeed SO difficult for all the fanboys to own up that the countless hours spent over the last several months, sitting up nights staring at their monitors and devouring every last bit of inconsequential trivia about TDK, have all amounted to a huge nothing. TDK is the prime example of how the advertising business works today, hyping up a product during pre-release to uncalled-for heights and ultimately forcing the gullible consumer to like the product against his better judgement. The marketing behind this film is very much THE phenomenal success story of this decade, and should serve as a de-facto case study for anyone who wants to understand just exactly how mob psychology works.EDIT : A more appropriate rating for this film is 4/10. But I so deeply despise Warner Bros. & the people lauding this film (i.e. everyone except me) that I must give it 1/10, just to balance things.","

"The Dark Knight","fung0","3 September 2008","The Dark Knight is a very good movie, and a very entertaining one. It's a film that leaves you feeling totally satisfied. But later, when you actually *think* about it, you may begin to wonder what you've actually seen.To be sure, the film has a number of major strengths. The sense of gritty realism is probably it's greatest asset. This is the superhero as a real-world phenomenon. The Batman of The Dark Knight is no more fantastic than, say, the James Bond of Casino Royale. (There's just one entirely needless bit of sci-fi - the whole thing with the cell-phone 'sonar' imaging. The film would be stronger without it.) Heath Ledger's performance is another big plus... though we shouldn't forget that Ledger is abetted by some very strong writing. It's a crowd-pleasing *part*, and we should be careful to spread the credit to all involved. I think Aaron Eckhart deserves mention as well; he's both likable and credible as the real square-jawed hero of the film.On the other hand, the film has some sizable (though not crippling) flaws.For starters, the story is relentlessly linear. In fact, there's barely a story at all. Nutjob Joker seeks to destroy crusading District Attorney Harvey Dent. That's about it. (Batman himself is almost incidental... which is not a bad thing.) Characterization is thin, to say the least. The Joker offers some hints at a back-story, but it's vague, self-contradictory and very, very limited. All the other roles are easily summed up in a single phrase. We've forgotten by now just why Bruce Wayne is so dedicated to fighting crime; it's taken for granted. And we never get much of a clue as to what makes Dent so fearlessly committed. Other characters simply go where the storyline demands. All this gives the film a breathless, streamlined velocity. But we need to admit that it ain't exactly Shakespeare... nor even Stan Lee.Scenically, the film is certainly impressive... especially if you see it in IMAX. (Although the constant shifts between IMAX and regular widescreen are a bit distracting.) One crucial visual element that really doesn't work, though, is Batman's costume. Despite an upgrade early in the film, it always seems stiff, cumbersome and unappealing. At one point, I was hauntingly reminded of Darth Vader. This Batman moves more like Iron Man than like Sam Raimi's spandex Spider-Man, or Ben Affleck's red-leather Daredevil.Finally, there's Christian Bale. He's much better here than in the dismal Batman Begins, and particularly good as the arrogant rich-boy Bruce Wayne. But he still doesn't bring much to the moderately important role of *Batman*. Physically, he gives off no feeling of strength; you never really believe he's a guy who could be punching it out with crowds of crooks every night. (Compare Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, or Matt Damon in the Bourne films; these guys have the Olympic physique a superhero would need.) When called upon to speak from behind the mask, Bale rasps unpleasantly, and his lips curl in a particularly ugly way. Admittedly, this Batman isn't intended to be *likable* (again, a good thing)... but a greater actor would have made him compellingly dark and brooding, rather than simply harsh and antisocial.All this may be nitpicking, but considering the hundreds of 10/10 ratings posted so far, I think a dose of reality is called for. The Dark Knight is an excellent film, no question... but not quite a work of diamond-like perfection. Let's appreciate it for what it is, rather than for what our enthusiasm would make it to be. Personally, I give it a solid 8/10, and reserve the perfect score for those perfect works of cinematic genius that do turn up every decade or so.","

"The Dark Knight","namashi_1","22 February 2009","Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' is one of the best film I've watched or ever will. A perfect film in each and every aspect. 'The Dark Knight' is a treat for a cinema lover, I was gripped, Stunned and Amused to see such a great film. Its the highest grossing film after Titanic, in my opinion it deserves to be at no.1.Performance Wise: Heath Ledger will live through his portrayal as The Joker. Giving him any award, can not be as high as his performance. He's fantastic. His performance ranks among the best in the History of Cinema. Bale as Batman is stupendous. Aaron is outstanding as Harvery Dent and even as the short-lived two-face. Maggie is good. Sir Michael Caine is amazing as Alfred. Gary Oldman is a legend, he's fab. Morgan Freeman is tremendous. Others also excel.'The Dark Knight' is one of the best film ever made. Cinema is proud to have a film like The Dark Knight. Two Thumbs Up!","

"The Dark Knight","alienstranger","21 December 2023","This movie is only great because of Joker and Nolan's direction. Otherwise its a childish movie to me with lots of weak characters. There are many flaws in it as a movie as well.like shawshank and godfather i saw it many times but couldnt appreciate it that much.its the 3rd best movie of all time. I mean really? Joker no doubt is absolutely brilliant and fairly deserved an oscar but what about the rest ? He alone carries this movie along and others look petty and naive characters before him. Symbolically there is a continuous fight between good and evil in this movie but its an old theme now..","

"The Dark Knight","matlefebvre20","7 August 2008","To be perfectly honest, I'm not the kind of moviegoer who waits to see the critics' reactions or to witness the box-office numbers in order to determine if I go watching a movie or not. Usually, my mind is made up several months before the release.I love Batman movies, but I expected to wait until the DVD release of ""The Dark Knight"" to get hold of it instead of going to the theater right away. But after hearing about the numerous laudatory reviews about the movie and witnessing the box-office records being beaten one after another in so little time, you'll understand that I couldn't resist. And now being able of talking about the movie in a retrospective way, I can tell you that I would have regretted my first choice.If ""The Dark Knight"" is that much praised and that much seen, it's because it's well deserved.. Whether a moviegoer is a fan of Batman or not, whether (s)he's curious about Heath Ledger's final role or (s)he doesn't give a damn, it'a movie that can satisfy anybody, independently of what's looked for.The story begins shortly after ""Batman Begins"" ends. How much time, exactly? The movie isn't very clear about that, but we quickly figure out that there hasn't a lot of time spent between the end of the first movie and the beginning of the second one. The Wayne Manor is still under re-construction, so Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) and his servant Alfred (Michael Caine) have to live in a penthouse for some little time.Meanwhile, criminals haven't been totally eradicated from Gotham City's map. And one of them, the manic and schizophrenic Joker (Heath Ledger, in the role of a lifetime and a death-time) appears and doesn't take much time before spreading even more chaos and terror in the streets of Gotham.Harvey Dent (a surprising Aaron Eckhart) is the new district attorney in the city and his energy, his ardor, his determination and his intelligence fascinate the inhabitants of Gotham. He has fallen in love with Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), Bruce's childhood sweetheart, and he works closely with the few honest cops of the city, all personified by scrupulously honest Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman).Obviously, when you think about the Joker, you can imagine that it won't be an easy game to win. But even if you're anticipating a lot from him and his performer Ledger, let me tell you that you'll be completely spellbound once you see it for real.Many journalists and professional critics imagine that Ledger could be granted a posthumous Oscar for his performance. Even if there are a lot of movies that will be released until the ceremony, and that many great roles will be unveiled before that date, I have to say that if Ledger receives a nomination, I wouldn't be surprised at all. I can imagine many of you having a suspicious look about the possibility of seeing a comic book villain awarded with an Oscar, but believe me, Ledger's performance is breathtaking and will silence many skeptics. It's simple: Ledger didn't play the Joker, he WAS the Joker. His appearance is very convincing (thank the make-up artists), but his voice, and especially his twitches with his tongue demonstrate the whole scale of his role. It's too bad that he's dead, because Ledger had everything he needed in order to become a new Brando or De Niro.But the biggest drawback about Ledger's performance, it's that he steals almost all the publicity, while another actor who deserves some recognition is almost completely overshadowed. I'm talking about Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, transformed at the end of the movie into Harvey Two-Face. Eckhart is astounding and he also delivers the performance of a lifetime. He is completely convincing as Harvey Dent and he is even more as Two-Face. As for his facial make-up, you can see it, but you can't believe it. It completely flabbergasted me for the rest of the movie. I think that ""The Dark Knight"" deserves a nomination for Best Make-up.The story is particularly complex and the movie, with its two and a half hours, may be a bit too long. Some would say that the movie is impossible to follow, that he contains a lot of useless characters and that some scenes could have been shortened up. I shall acquiesce to these complaints, but I also think that director Christopher Nolan deliberately created a film based upon the Joker's personality: manic, chaotic, merciless and full of surprises.Nolan proves once again his great mastery of mixing action scenes with the psychological side of his characters. The cinematography here is even more extraordinary than in ""Batman Begins"". Here's another man who should be awarded with an Oscar in a more-or-less distant future.Besides Ledger and Eckhart, the other actors play their own role with professionalism. My only complaint concerns Maggie Gyllenhaal, who I think is totally miscast, especially after that Katie Holmes played the role of Rachel Dawes in the first movie. If you compare both pictures, it looks like Rachel has aged of about fifteen years between both.This film makes us realize two things. First, Heath Ledger had a lot of potential and his premature death will earn him a place in the category of the stars dead too quickly, among with James Dean and River Phoenix. Second, Ledger's performance, paired with Jack Nicholson's one in the 1989 ""Batman"" proves that the Joker is the #1 villain in all of the comic book medium.""The Dark Knight"" will probably be venerated as Heath Ledger's swan song and as Aaron Eckhart's breakthrough. It will also be probably treated as cursed, considering Ledger's death, Bale's arrest and Freeman's accident. One thing is sure, it will forever be a great movie and the immutable testament of a legend gone too quickly. Hence the saying: ""Only the good die young.""","

"The Dark Knight","brownish33","23 November 2011","damn i cant believe the reviews for this film. I've only seen this twice and don't plan on seeing it again anytime soon, and this coming from a lifelong batman MOVIE fan (note the emphasis on MOVIE, not COMICS).I've seen the original film 200000 times and i loved all the sequels, even the ""campy"" Schumacher ones. but boy did they take this franchise in a reverse direction. JUST because batman & robin was terrible and silly doesn't make Christopher Nolan's films the comic book equivalent of the ""godfather"" or gone with the frigging wind. if anything, they only show how amazing Tim Burton's 2 original dual pictures are, and how utterly lame the Nolan ones are. not only is ""the dark knight"" worse then batman begins, its downright ridiculous! you feel like you need a degree in law to understand what the hell they are talking about. its like CSI meets Gotham city. you might as well call this movie GCPD or GCPD Blue, or any of those law and order-type shows that this movie seems to copy from. its even more silly when you look at the lengths the director went through to make this batman movie as boring as possible. they seem to think ""if the story is engaging enough, we don't have to make the movie visually appealing"". thats like saying ""if the story is good enough, we don't have to make batman look awesome in the comics"".lets get this review started shall we? first, the joker. we are all familiar I'm sure with jack Nicholson's classic portrayal from the original film. it was truly amazing, he made the character eerie, funny, and charming all at once. yet he seemed to understand that this character is based off cartoons and as such you cant take yourself all that seriously. this is the complete opposite of what heath ledger does with the same role. but i guess you cant really blame the actor entirely with Nolan wanting to change up batman and his world to the point that the characters aren't really who they should be. first off, joker doesn't fall in a vat of acid like the original, he puts on makeup and cuts his own smile and dyes his hair green. i would hate to see his joker in the rain, he would look rather pathetic as a joker. i can guarantee that if Nicholson didn't already do this classic comics origin 20 years ago in the awesome first film, fan boys would be crying that joker was turned into common serial killer done a million times over in other films and not the funny amusing comic book clown prince of crime that everyone is more familiar with. oh, but since Nicholson already played THAT version to perfection, Nolan was somehow able to get away with turning joker into a common killer that we've seen time and again. Heath didn't really even play the﻿ Joker, he played ""generic serial killer bad guy #13314"". for those who would defend ledger by saying he was ""really scary and terrifying"", sure ill give them that, but to say he was better than NICHOLSON?!? JACK FREAKING NICHOLSON?!? PLEEEEEEEEEEASE!!! The role was virtually MADE for the man when he was born.﻿ Nicholson captured the true essence of the Joker; a psychopathic man child out not to prove a good damn thing, but to kill and mess around with people all for the laughs. THESE are traits that define the Joker, not some cliché ideal of wanting people to accept that evil exists in all of us. and that brings me to another point, whats with this jokers anarchist pseudo-philosophic rambling monologues? boy Nolan LOVES these cardboard deep monologues he has his character spew out all the time, even in the last film. its laughable at how serious he takes the movie. did he forget this is based off of comic books and that there are supposed to be fun elements in the film? Tim Burton struck the perfect balance of comic book and reality. its somewhere right in the middle. Nolan puts a guy in a bat suit and places him right in middle of an unaltered real life city. it makes him look silly and out of place.I'm not gonna dwell much on bales batman. this guy cant save any movie hes in. people seem to love this guy, or think hes some brilliant actor, but hes obviously just a wooden actor and once again phoned in his ""performance"" in this film. to quote Christopher walken from Batman Returns, ""hes just a poor schmo, who got lucky"". his batman voice is ludicrous. ludicrous! i still don't understand why they decided to make batman sound like an engine turning over. every time he talks he makes me laugh. the only decently done things in this film is how Harvey dent is portrayed (pre-twoface) and the pretty nifty bat pod, that has ONE cool scene in which it bursts from the bat mobile. but again, the action scenes never pick up because of Nolan's hard on for realism, so nothing in the new Batman films ever makes you go ""OOH Awesome"" for too long. this movie just dragged and i remember looking at the clock as to when it would end. they make it feel like the new Batman's are ""smart"" but honestly, in a comic book movie who the heck wants to listen to all this law and order talk and long drawn out ""deep"" monologues? its so....meh. i'd rather watch jack Nicholson laugh like a maniac shooting his henchman and making me laugh. who can forget gems like ""bob, gun"". today you have ""why so serious?"". yeah thats what i want to know, why so serious Nolan?? why cant you make batman fun? nothing against having darkness, Burton's films were dark too but not so much to the point where they weren't fun or exciting. again, disappointed.","

"The Dark Knight","GeneSiskel","2 January 2009","In the old days, film-makers told stories. Now they create effects. That tells you pretty much all you need to know about ""The Dark Knight."" If you like car chases with flashy digitization and sonic booms, you'll love ""The Dark Knight."" Otherwise, stay home and read a book.Admittedly ""The Dark Knight"" looks spectacular on an Imax screen, and Heath Ledger has to be a hands down winner of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. There are also plenty of familiar faces passing through the production -- Michael Caine, once a leading man, doing his by now standard Gielgud imitation as a butler, Morgan Freeman doing his by now standard role as God/CEO/Chief Technology Officer, Maggie Gyllenhall as the prim sexless object of everyone's affections, Christian Bale as the trust fund guy himself, Aaron Eckhart as an untouchable prosecutor. They meander and lurch through a plot so turgid that it isn't even worth diagramming as they face assorted actual and threatened explosions, free falls, assaults with deadly weapons, shattered windows, fires, and the aforementioned vehicle chases. For 152 minutes or so until finally, at long last, the closing credits come up, and everyone can go home.There's no magic, no mystery, no glamor, no insight, no humanity in this movie. It's all ""BANG,"" ""POW,"" ZAP,"" ""CRASH,"" ""BOOM."" And it's all pointless.","

"The Dark Knight","Leofwine_draca","3 June 2016","Following on from BATMAN BEGINS comes Christopher Nolan's second entry in the revitalised Batman film series. I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie and looked forward to this one, aware that many principal cast members were returning. Add to this all the fuss surrounding Heath Ledger's untimely demise and his supposedly terrifying performance as the Joker, and I walked into the cinema ready for a great time. I wasn't disappointed.This is Hollywood blockbuster film-making at its finest: intelligent, well-scripted, with great effects, acting and choreography. This is a powerful, brooding film, even darker than its predecessor, that packs a whole lotta violence into a 12a certificate movie. Okay, so this film ain't gory, but it's certainly one of the most violent and disturbing flicks I've seen in a while. A lot of that is down to Ledger's performance, which has rightly been called brilliant. Blowing memories of Jack Nicholson out of the water, Ledger is a virtuoso in the role, a real freak of nature, a repulsive killer stealing every scene. It's the best performance this actor ever gave, and it's a shame he died when he was just realising his true potential as an actor and not as a wooden pretty boy.The film kicks off with action and follows it with more action. Car chases, fantastic technology (the sonar stuff breaks new boundaries), some martial arts fights and the biggest and best explosion seen on film...they're all here and they never let up. The bone-breaking blows that Batman rains down on the villains are incredibly powerful and I still can't work out how this achieved a kiddie-friendly rating. The script has plenty of twists and turns, including the deaths of some notable leading characters, and plenty of characterisation as well. Themes of good and evil and what it means to be a hero are explored well and the actors all do their roles justice. Special mention goes to Aaron Eckhart, an actor who I've previously found bland but who's excellent as DA Harvey Dent here.If I had any complaints, it would be that Bale hardly gets a look in as Batman takes a back seat to the villains on display. But when they're so good, who cares? Old-timers Caine and Freeman add sparkle, humour and warmth to their parts and there are lots of laughs along the way to go with the shocks and chills. I found Gyllenhaal to be a lacklustre replacement for Katie Holmes, but she's barely around so that doesn't matter. Special effects are top-notch, with one make-up/CGI job surpassing Arnie's ruined face in TERMINATOR 3. So THE DARK KNIGHT is a fantastic film – dark, bleak and uncompromising. It may be a little too much for some viewers, but I loved every second of it – and I look forward to watching it again. A great film.","

"The Dark Knight","Abusimble1","11 September 2008","I was expecting to see at least a semi-good movie but this film is not even up to par. This film gets a 1 rating from me because it tries to depict Batman and fails miserably at it. Even for an action movie if Batman hadn't been in it, it's not good. The plot is horrid and morbid, the amount of gore unhealthy and the fight sequences are badly done. Notable problems:A. What is this rock theme music that's constant in the movie? It comes whenever a suspense scene starts and sounds like an annoying electric guitar. What is this doing in a Batman film? Also, the plot seems to be totally disconnected in between scenes. The entire movie is like one big mishmash of 10 different stories that occur in succession. It is also unrealistic many times. In the beginning The Joker simply takes his schoolbus into the convoy to escape. And the way he avoids police in broad daylight and blows up the hospital is unbelievable.B. The Joker in this film is someone with a predilection for violence and violence alone. Traditionally, The Joker has been a nefarious, insane character. He does things that are out of kilter with normalcy. He then laughs at what he does and takes unexpected delight in it. This Joker is not like so. He's simply a disturbed psychopath who likes to blow up things and harm others. There's no depth to the character.C. Harvey Dent has been traditionally Black the last 2 decades. That and the way he's made into Two-Face in this movie is totally wrong. Two-Face traditionally goes on to become a crime boss but in this movie, he simply dies soon after coming into being. He also isn't a good Two-Face, overusing his coin flip to make decisions. For example, in the limousine scene he flips the coin again and kills the driver in order to eliminate a crime boss. The real Two-Face wouldn't have cheated like this once the coin makes a decision for him.D. Batman himself doesn't appear much in the movie. We are shown glimpses of him and the fight scenes are very darkly lit so it's hard to see who and how he's fighting. His over-reliance on technology is also not good because Batman usually uses wits as well as brawn. The voice of Batman is guttural sounding and Bruce Wayne himself doesn't seem to have any emotions. Micheal Keaton's portrayal of Batman in Batman (made in 1989) is by far the best in all movies.The Dark Knight is not just not a good Batman film. It's a poor film in any genre. I recommend watching Batman (1989) if one wants to see an excellent Batman film. Here's a small sample from this great movie that's better than the entire The Dark Knight:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC249jPbBDY","

"The Dark Knight","Quinoa1984","18 July 2008","I wasn't sure what to expect from The Dark Knight a sequel to Batman Begins and, by virtue of extended franchise, a remake of the Tim Burton 1989 Batman movie, which also featured Batman, the Joker, and Harvey Dent (though not Two-Face). The previews had all the action and excitement, and some cool-looking gadgets, but... despite the whole ""Heath Ledger is dead, this is final great performance"" hype, I didn't want to second guess myself. A Joker with no real ""origin"" story? Ledger playing him with slapped on, sloppy make-up and lots of facial tics? How will this work, and how could it be any better than Nicholson's Joker? Answers? It does work, very well, though it's dependent on the universe that director Christopher Nolan has set in place. Ledger's Joker wouldn't work in Burton's style, as his mix of camp and seriousness was perfect for an actor like Nicholson. But in Nolan's world, he fits in like a f***ing psychotic glove. To get it out of the way for this review, I'll say this: Ledger practically lives up to the hype. His presence is uncouth and strange, and not like one's used to (the slashes through his face are ""jokingly"" referenced that ""my dad did this, ""my wife did this""), and he's totally ambiguous. But it's also the unpredictable Joker seen yet on screen, and only topped probably in the craziest of the comics. He's an unpredictable force that is the twisted ying to Batman's protect-by-all-means-but-murder yang. It's basically an anarchic punk rocker taken to the lengths of a terrorist.While this should make the Joker boring, there's nothing that Nolan isn't willing to do to make the audience jump or second guess the plot, which makes it extra exciting as he heads on in the last half hour, leading to an incredible double-catharsis of sorts. But if Ledger's performance is being touted for an posthumous Oscar nomination (which I'm still not sure about though will probably happen), then the amount of attention being paid to Aaron Eckhardt is minuscule in comparison. On his own terms, Eckhart delivers a performance that's even better than Ledger's (or, rather, he has a lot more complexity than ""I'm gonna blow stuff up and go chaotic here""). He puts in everything that's needed for the perfect Harvey Dent, as a man who's the ""white knight"", someone who could be the one to take the place of Batman as the one to look after Gotham. His downfall, however, becomes the great, horrifying tragedy of this Batman. To say Eckhart blows all other interpretations (on film or TV) of Dent is putting it lightly, and the make-up given to his latter reincarnation is some of the best I've ever seen.In the interest of not coming off like a total crazy fan-boy for the Dark Knight, there are some likely criticisms to have. Despite Nolan's vision being epic and grand, and for the most part pulling off such a big story very well, the last section, however exciting and tense and posing moral questions, goes a little long. And, however staying true to the comics (which is great), the last section starts to pile on the exposition a bit much. But these are mostly mild quibbles. In the scope of delving into the Batman world as honestly (if not realistically) as possible, Nolan succeeds even further than in 'Begins'. The characters of Batman/Wayne, Gordon, Dent, and Rachel Dawson are all put into incredible circumstances throughout the film, and we're pulling for them and care about what happens all the way. It's all the more a credit to the storytelling power since we should know how things will turn out; a certain twist mid-way through had me thinking ""say it isn't so"", and when I knew I was had, I knew Nolan had done his job well.Another question: does Dark Knight live up to the hype? It depends on how you define it and how it pertains to the movie. A lot of the hype has been around Ledger's death, and the new characters, and some of the hype (i.e. box-office predictions) have become ludicrous. Yet, for what Nolan set out to do as filmmaker, delivering drama and action and pathos and a kick-ass-but-truly-conflicted Batman in his *very* dark city of Gotham, he succeeded admirably. It might not be the same amount of pure ""fun"" of Burton's films, but then again it doesn't need to be. It's an excellent, breathtaking experience, and one of the best pics of 08.","

"The Dark Knight","Kefka_8203","14 February 2009","And thus it has been watched; one of the most talked about movies of latter years. The crowning achievement of Nolas career and the apex of Heath ledgers movie history. So is it worth the praise? Does it live up to the expectations set? In short, no. In long: Noooooooooooooooo. The Dark Knight should, at heart, be about Batman and his eternal nemesis the Joker. But Nolans uneven film-making assures this is not the case; The movie has more subplots than three full seasons of ""Days of our Lives""; and most of the subplots feels as relevant as that show. To put it simply: This movie tried to put too much into too short a time. To move on to more specific details: The story has enough plot holes to sink Titanic; How does the Joker finance his operations when he seems unwilling to use cash? How does he get an army of loons to work as a cohesive and highly fanatical religious unit? How does he smuggle vast amounts of explosives onto two boats and one hospital? Another weak point is bad acting and just stupid plot movement; Bale is excellent as Bruce Wayne, he is however horrible as Batman. His completely hilarious attempt at distorting his voice sounds like a severe case of throat cancer. It is of little consequence however as he's delegated to the role of sidekick anyway. The actor who played Harvey Dent is in the long run pointless; He is of TV-quality and can't handle his role .Then again, he does it better than Tommy Lee Jones did. Gary Oldman has something of a broken look over him; he seems to wish out of the movie as soon as possible. Michael Caine as Alfred isn't that good compared to the old Alfred, but he suffices. Morgan Freeman does what he does best; Speaks with an authoritative voice.And now..To the name of the movie: Heath Ledger, who's untimely death has elevated him to the sort of cult status only death celebrities gets. WHich is unfortunate for while he was a good actor his role here is NOT that good. His version of the Joker is decent, but looses itself in some sort of misguided attempt at realism. In the end the only thing it manages to come across as is boring. The Joker is realistic, and yet gifted with overwhelming superpowers which allows him to do pretty much everything he sets his mind too. And I mean anything; Build up a criminal empire strictly on IOU notes? Check. Smuggle several tons of explosives into what one can be assumed is heavily guarded ferries? Check. Do the same to a major hospital? Check. Convince the man who's wife to be he just murdered brutally that he isn't responsible because he's just ""A dog""? Check. Damnit, this guy could probably convince Batman that he really does have feelings for Robin.Overall TDK is a uneven movie: It is hampered by poor acting, lousy effects and a horrible script. But it has some bright spots in mood and overall theme. In the end, it isn't enough and I cannot for the life of me understand why this movies is hailed as the second coming of Christ.","

"The Dark Knight","Paul-271","3 August 2008","Unlike many others, I'm not going to rate this a one star to counterbalance the lunacy shown by many IMDb'ers in giving this mediocre outing a 10. I will instead rate it fairly by my estimates.Pretty much all the adverse criticism you'll find by reading the one or two star reviews are accurate. The issue isn't if this movie fails continuity time and time again, but if it matters. After all, isn't this a cartoon? Yet it isn't. I'm not a fan or cartoons or the previous Batman offerings. I consider the 'dark Gothic look' of Gotham City which some so love to be puerile. At the start of this, I enjoyed that instead of fakey doo dark city infested with grotesque characters, we were in Chicago - a reasonably lighted place with humans as the dominant residents.However, if you are going to change the ground rules so you are in normal human space, then you need to adhere by these rules. Having some guy in silly makeup able to appear anywhere even in the company of his continually refreshed gang is jarring to say the least. Where did he get his superhuman cameo powers from? If you wish to posit at the start that the villain isn't human,or has supernatural powers or is an alien like Predator, then OK, but don't make him a human driven by human needs, cut off any back story and then give him powers which could easily defeat both Alien and Pedator.Also for gosh sakes, do a little homework. At one point a fellow removes a pistol from a criminal in court. Like criminals can just waltz into court with handguns so he can then later attempt to shoot the prosecutor. Worse, when the fellow is disarmed the guy doing the disarm move claims it to be a .28 caliber....Good grief. Was that supposed to be a joke or is Hollywood that lazy not to even note that there is no such thing in a modern Glock like pistol.In the end, this is a movie with no bright spots. It's despair all the way. There is no hope for goodness. Instead, we're given the choice between anarchy or oppression. Worse, the oppressive ones are the government who lack the will to deal with the anarchists.","

It was so dimly lit, they could have had any of the thousands of out-of-work actors in Southern California in it with no perceptible difference. I guess a couple more explosions would have helped (not really). I only watched it cause of Heath Ledger's excellent performance in Brokeback Mountain. Boy, was I disappointed. I didn't care about anyone while watching except for myself who was waiting for it to end. At times the dialog was difficult to understand with the volume way up but the loud soundtrack made every sound effect rattle the furniture.I just don't get what passes for great entertainment nowadays. I had to watch some old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons afterward as an intelligent antidote to this cartoonish movie that tries for so much significance, an odd combination. It's like looking for significance and the meaning of life in an infomercial. Don't bother.","

"The Dark Knight","didi-5","17 August 2008","The hype has been OTT, but for once it is justified. 'The Dark Knight' is all you've been led to believe, and more. Christian Bale returns as the caped crusader, the vigilante looking after the streets of Gotham by night, and this time he has a new and dangerous foe, The Joker (played by Heath Ledger, of more later). This nemesis takes the Batman series into chilling territory, far beyond the bam! bang! of the old 60s series with Adam West. It's never been quite this dark before.Is this a film for under-twelves, as the British certification suggests? Absolutely not. For a start, it is wordy, with an intelligent script and involving characters, which might get little ones fidgeting. Then there is the violence - mostly implied, but unpleasant and set to give shivers down the spine nonetheless. You see some gore and through jarring music, sound effects and shaky video footage you can imagine a lot more. The worst thing in marketing this film to a young audience is glorifying knife killing, if you view a psychopath as a hero.Bale is OK, a little dry as Bruce Wayne, but more than adequate. Michael Caine reprises his role as Alfred and is not bad at all, although someone prepared to do another accent might have been interesting. Maggie Gyllenhaal is slightly annoying as Rachel, but since her character isn't there to do much, it doesn't really matter. And Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman are solid in support as Harvey and Gordon.Back to Heath Ledger. The publicity surrounding his performance in this has reached ridiculous heights due to his early death at the beginning of the year, but he really does steal the film and pull off an amazing performance as a truly nasty villain who manages to be comic in the blackest of ways as well. Whether walking away from a blazing hospital in a nurse's uniform with a detonator that keeps jamming, or taunting police officers from the floor of a jail, or standing in the path of a motorbike bellowing 'Hit me' his performance is absolutely electric and by far the best thing about this film.Could another actor have made the same impact? I doubt it. And that's what gives 'The Dark Knight', for me, the edge over other blockbusters this year. Seen on IMAX screens, it is also mind-blowing in its effects and scope.","

"The Dark Knight","M4XB0X","9 November 2023","Almost never does a sequel surpass the hugely successful prequel, well not for Nolan, the Dark Knight surpasses its predecessor in narrative intensity thanks to the majestic interpretation of the masked hero's number one enemy, Heath Ledger aka Joker. Good versus evil, moral personality versus person-made immorality, both at the limit in pursuing their purpose, so distant yet so close. Pure action, spectacle, special effects, narration, practically a perfect film, a milestone to be left for future memory. No Batman will ever be the same again and no Batman will ever be like this. Truly sublime!","

"The Dark Knight","emilygingergina","13 August 2020","The movie is pretty boring and bad, however the joker scenes are amazing. If the whole movie was like his scenes, I would've given it 9 stars. However, sadly, the movie is depriving us of Joker because there are only like 5 scenes with him. Batman is pretty comedic in this movie. Which is not a good thing. He is always acting serious but his voice is just, how do I say this, cringe worthy. Batman sounds like one of those kids YouTubers that make videos of Batman and Elsa hooking up (yes those videos exist, please monitor what your kids are doing/watching online). The movie ends pretty abruptly, and left me confused. (I recommend watching Joker instead).","

"The Dark Knight","dee.reid","5 August 2008","""The Dark Knight"" may or may not get the title for the greatest superhero film of all time (questionable, but I still hold that 2004's ""Spider-Man 2"" is the greatest), but unquestionably what will forever make it memorable is that it features the much-talked-about final performance of Heath Ledger, who passed away tragically from an accidental drug overdose earlier this year, thus making ""The Dark Knight"" a must-see at the movies this summer. His performance here is the film's shining achievement, although strangely enough he doesn't get that much screen time in a movie that runs 152 minutes and he's only on screen maybe half that time. (In what is) Probably the most beloved adaptation of the DC Comics character created by Bob Kane and who first appeared in ""Detective Comics #27,"" Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) is again battling the forces of evil as the Dark Knight of grim Gotham City, aided in his endeavors by several loyal confidants including faithful butler Alfred (Michael Caine), Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman), and inventor Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). Things get underway when a bank robbery (a la 1995's ""Heat"") involving clown-faced goons yields a new and terrifying menace to law & order in Gotham City: The Joker (Ledger), a disfigured criminal mastermind looking to spread chaos and destruction and bring about the downfall of the Dark Knight. Meanwhile, Bruce (forever brooding) is vying for the affections of ADA Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Katie Holmes from 2005's ""Batman Begins"") against Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who's on his own personal crusade to rid Gotham City of crime and corruption. At a hefty 2 1/2-hour running time, director Christopher Nolan seemed to throw everything into ""The Dark Knight,"" even in one interview I read calling this film this series' ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Perhaps an accurate assertion, since a lot does happen here but occasionally this oft-brilliant and mesmerizing film is prone to stalling in its quieter moments (and believe me, there are some). I do find it quite odd that since we're talking about Gotham City, one of the darkest places in comic books, there is an amazing amount of light, since many of the action scenes take place in broad daylight rather than under a menacing cover of darkness. The sheer brilliance of ""The Dark Knight"" is the belated Heath Ledger. Like Brandon Lee in ""The Crow"" (1994), this film is a testament, it is the last great work of a truly great actor and he will be missed. As the Joker, Ledger is cold and calculating, and truly menacing. He's evil and madness incarnate, and who could forget his now-classic ""Why so serious?"" ""The Dark Knight"" is far from perfect, I already mentioned the overly long running time and the seeming tacked-on rise of a deadly new villain, but the performance of Heath Ledger as The Joker and some stellar acting from the leads definitely makes this Dark Knight, the Darkest Knight for comic book superhero movies.10/10","

"The Dark Knight","jmbellin","3 August 2008","Unfortunately, this is a movie that just didn't know where to go most of the time. We have an almost three hour movie that really feels longer and doesn't know where to go and when to stop.First of all, let's talk about Heath Ledger's performance. The hype is absolutely justified. He lights up the screen with his performance and the film is delightful when he is on the screen. Part of the problem is that no other characters are equally as interesting and that includes Christian Bale as Batman. There is not all that much charisma in Christian Bale's characterization as Bruce Wayne and none of the other characters grab the screen the way Heath Ledger does, so the movie doesn't really give Heath Ledger much to play off of most of the time. Eric Roberts, almost unrecognizable probably due to the work that has been done on his face, has some acting moments in a minor role that cause a stir. I always liked him and wish I saw more of him.Meanwhile, the film has so many twists and turns that do nothing more than confuse, I felt more like I was in a maze that I couldn't get out of rather than on a roller coaster ride. Just when I thought there might be a resolution to the film, yet another plot twist, a new discovery would occur. I found myself looking at my watch after about an hour and a half or so, and the movie was only half over! The first part of the film, that is to say, the first hour, was more character setup and that was far more interesting. The first part of the film relied more on dialogue and there was quite a bit of evident wit. But when the plot points started getting laid on thick and heavy, I got restless and continued to get more so. At film's end, I ended up thinking ""So what?"". I was glad to have seen Heath Ledger's performance, but not much more than that. I felt, other than for Ledger, the film wasted my time (and money).","

"The Dark Knight","abdelgulabkhan","27 February 2009","The worst film i have seen this year. Its so Boring. I think it got good reviews because heath ledger died and that was a tribute to him. Batman is crap, the joker is average. The first Batman with Jack Nicholas as the joker is 1000 times better, that was excellent, this was dire and boring. Beware, batman fans are just going over the top for this heap of rubbish. The film is so predictable because you know what happens. I think that gadgets were not that good and the actors were not that good. I was expecting this to be great but as with all films with far too much hype i was waiting for the good bit. After an hour i was still waiting. After 2 i thought this is so dull and it wasn't going anywhere. I love good films eg Iron Man, Lord Of Rings, Indianna Jones, Shawshank Redemption, Star Wars. This is a classic by no means.","

"The Dark Knight","mihaildosev","28 June 2023","First of all, no I don't think this movie is bad. But I don't think it should be thought of as the gold standart for comic book movies. Because honestly, this movie doesn't feel like a comic book.This is a very good action movie, that dresses it's main protagonist and antagonist as comic book characters. And here I think lies the problem.This is a movie about a billionaire, dressed as a bat, who beats an anarchist clown. And Christopher Nolan tries to make this look serious. I'm sorry, it doesn't work. It just takes away the comic book feeling. And therefore it becomes a little boring. If Heath Ledger isn't on the screen I find myself hardly invested in what's happening.To be honest, I never really liked this movie that much. Maybe because I first watched when I was 8 and it felt boring. But I watched it a few times in later years and I still remember only pieces of fractions of what's happening, outside of scenes that have the Joker. And to be fair, I probably wouldn't have remembered those pieces, if I didn't watch reviews out of boredom.I went online to see if there is anybody who feels the same way and they all said the same thing: Heath Ledger single handedly saves this movie. And while his performance is spectacular, I can't think of him as a definitive Joker. He is good for this movie, but I'm not sure if I can see him fit in other Batman movies. And a personal bias of mine is that no one is ever going to top Mark Hamill. However, Ledger did his own thing and he did good. Unlike other main charachters in the movie, this one won people over. But it's still in a movie that plays everything too serious.It feels like Nolan took the main charachters from a comic book and put them in this, just because otherwise it would have been just another action movie. It lacks a certain element. It lacks that comic book campiness, that even the most serious comic books have a pinch of in them. And therefore it fails to deliver as a comic book movie.That's not to say that being serious is a bad change. Too many comic book are corny as hell and very often it gets annoying. But if you get too serious, you get boring. One should not be at the expense of the other. One must find a balance between the comic book campiness and the seriousness of the real world.To quote a certain character: Why so serious?","

"The Dark Knight","CitizenCaine","17 August 2008","Christopher Nolan returns with The Dark Knight, his second entry in the post millennial Batman franchise. Christian Bale returns as a more anguished, morally ambiguous Batman than before. Morgan Freeman returns as Luscious Fox, Gary Oldman returns as Gordon, and Michael Caine once again is Alfred. All actors shine in their supportive roles, especially Oldman. Maggie Gyllenhaal is the new Rachel Dawes and is OK in the role but nothing more. Aaron Eckhart plays Harvey Dent/Two-face in a great visual parallel to the film's theme of moral ambiguity and the duality of man. Heath Ledger as the psychotic joker becomes the catalyst forcing each of the righteous men to act for good or ill: Batman, Harvey Dent, and Gordon. Ledger's performance is as good as advertised. The action, acting, art and set direction, cinematography, dialog, and direction are all first rate. The film builds to a different kind of climax, reminding us that fate plays a role in influencing our lives, and we must adjust to survive. This is a terrific action film for adults with several contemporary parallels that are a little uncomfortable at times. There are a few drawbacks, such as how the joker seems to pull everything off without a hitch off camera. The Bond-like moments and the obnoxious flip comments made by Nicky Katt in the S.W.A.T. van during the chase under the Chicago loop are serious detractors from an otherwise outstanding super hero movie. The brief appearance by scarecrow served what purpose? This appears in IMDb's top 5 of all time? I think that says more about today's audiences and less about the film. ***1/2 of 4 stars.","

"The Dark Knight","Stampsfightclub","17 August 2008","In the sequel to Batman Begins (2005), Batman and Gotham are under threat from a man known as the Joker, who is causing mayhem amongst the mob, and starts to focus his attention towards The Dark Knight, and Gotham City.In the most anticipated film of the year so far, Christian Bale and Christopher Nolan team up once again for a triumphant return to the Batman franchise and deliver a darker, more sophisticated and exciting film than their previous collaboration.The plot of Batman Begins was exciting to discover the origins of how Batman came about, and this follow up sees how Batman's personal life is affected, with multiple stories revolving around the Joker, Harvey Dent and Rachel, which gives the film excellent depth and interest and this is what makes it better than the previous, that and Heath Ledger (Brokeback Mountain).As The Dark Knight was released Heath Ledger stole the headlines for his performance as the menacing villain, and seeing the trailer I couldn't wait to see if he lived up to the hype and the truth was he excelled the hype and has made the best Batman villain ever.So dark and dangerous, the cunning and the general madness of the character was brought to such a marvellous light by Ledger, and has, in my opinion, outshone Jack Nicholson's (Batman) portrayal of the Joker. And though the plot and everything about this film is excellent, Ledger is the best part about it all.Though I was slightly confused with all the mob dealings at the beginning, the plot is consistent with a wonderful depth to it, covering a lot of character's personal situations brilliantly. The visual effects are stunning. The action sequences are kept to a minimum, which was brilliant in my opinion as it is so easy to over do action and escape from the realism, but it was all done inch perfect with accurate realism. The direction is excellent by Nolan again, really capturing the mood of the genre and is without question the best Batman film made to date","

"The Dark Knight","richard-hodges","29 July 2008","The Dark Knight is an extraordinary mish-mash lacking logic and cohesion.Technically, the film is well made. That is, it looks and feels like a blockbuster, though a solid score is sorely lacking.On the plus side, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman add gravitas to an otherwise ordinary ensemble.And sadly, a fine actor will be remembered, not for the likes of moving and sensitive performances seen in Brokeback Mountain and Candy, but rather an excellent make-up job, an over-active tongue and a silly voice. As farewell performances rate, Heath Ledger's Joker sits alongside Peter Sellers' Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu Manchu.To remind yourself how super hero movies should be made, dust off your copy of Spiderman II (from which it borrows) or Superman The Movie (from which it should've borrowed).","

"The Dark Knight","pgwhite95","7 January 2009","I went to see the ""dark knight"" on opening weekend with my girlfriend. Both of us are comic book junkies, and we absolutely loved ""batman begins."" We went into the theater with the anticipation that we were going to see a continuation of the first movie. Although, the story has evolved since the first film, I was not as moved by the screenplay as I was before. I guess the first and foremost problem is the use of Maggie Gyllenhaal as, Rachel Dawes. Yes, I know that Katie Holmes turned down the roll, (not very smart on her part), however that subtle difference made me think less of her roll and more on the fact that she wasn't Katie Holmes. The second part that I had a problem with is that the trailers of this film, and all the hype leading up to it made Heath Ledger's roll as ""the joker"" less appealing. Although he does pull of the job of being disturbed quite well, this is in no way what I had imagined him to be. It almost seemed like his character was subdued a bit, and should have been done with greater emphasis. I still contest that Jack Nicholson was the best joker. Anyway, it is still a great movie, I saw it twice in the theater, and own it now on DVD. Inspite of all the flaws of this film, I still recommend it to comic book junkies, like myself, and anyone else who likes a good story.","

"The Dark Knight","Roger_Sterling","18 July 2008","The Dark Knight was setting records even before its release. The hype was on since late 2007, and was only fueled by the sudden and tragic death of Heath Ledger in January. Did The Dark Knight live up to the massive expectations? Yes. Definitely.The story progresses very well, and the 2 and half hour running time flies by. Pay attention though, or you may get lost.The action is plentiful, and there is just the right amount. Not too much, not too little. There aren't too many explosions just for show, and the special effects look great.Performances Christian Bale is spot on as the tormented defender of Gotham. He gives a very believable performance in one scene of raw emotion that I won't spoil here.Michael Caine once again plays Alfred in a role that makes him a mentor/friend even more so than in Begins, or any of the older movies for that matter.Morgan Freeman also reprises his role as Lucius Fox, who once again supplies Bruce with the gadgets and cutting-edge technology he needs to combat crime.Maggie Gyllenhaal, who replaces Katie Holmes from Batman Begins, plays Rachel Dawes, a pivotal character in the movie, and in the lives of Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent. Even if you think Gyllenhaal may not be much of a looker, she certainly has far more charisma than Holmes in the role.Newcomer Aaron Eckhart debuts in the series as Harvey Dent, the new District Attorney, and a shining ray of hope on the corrupt Gotham City. Batman thinks he may be the man who may make Gotham no longer need Batman. However, fans of the comics know who he is destined to become.And last, but most certainly not least, Heath Ledger.From the trailers alone, I could tell he was going to give a commanding performance, but I was not expecting this. Ledger completely disappears into the role, and is virtually unrecognizable. He easily gives the best performance of the movie as the psychopathic, sadistic Joker. It is unfortunate and sad he will not be able to reprise his role in the third film, if there will be one.The Dark Knight is easily the best film of the year so far, and by far the darkest. I won't say much, but don't be surprised if you don't get a happy ending.In my opinion, the best film of the year, and the best Batman and superhero movie ever.","

"The Dark Knight","hyperbart","7 August 2008","Having had to wait for 2 weeks before I had a chance to watch The Dark Knight, I was thrilled when the time came. After the first week of IMDb votes I kinda guessed there was some hype going on. But after 200.000 votes the grade was still 9.4. Was this still a hype or was the movie genuinely good? Also reading very positive movie reviews and hearing people go on and on about how great Heath was as the Joker, this meant the movie just had to be great, right? Well it's NOT. It's a good movie, but people who compare it to history's best cinematic productions are just out of their mind.Let me get to the first point of the hype: the Joker. I read reviews of this character being the most evil, terrifying, psychotic and creepy villain they had ever seen. I must agree that Heath does a great job of playing the Joker. But this just isn't living up to what I read and heard. The biggest problem with the Joker is that this is still an action hero movie, not a thriller or horror for that matter. What the Joker does made me laugh most of the time. I mean his opening with jamming the pencil through a guys eye may sound creepy when you hear or read it, but in this movie it's just hysterical. The Joker isn't scary or creepy at any point. He is psychotic, he is unpredictable and he is played with great depth (for a character that is flat in the script). But he can never compete with the great villains like Hannibal Lecter or even Jigsaw. Those are just out of his league. I would love to have seen the Joker develop more. The screen time for Heath is just way too low for him to carry this movie (although lot's of critics claim he already caries the movie, which would be a sad conclusion if you ask me). It's a shame Heath died.With that hype out of the way, the rest of the movie is pretty plain. It has great special effects and make-up, for which it'll surely compete for awards. But the other actors really can't deliver, even great ones like Freeman. Characters are not developed. Which brings the viewer in an awkward situation when we have to feel the pain that both Dent and Wayne feel when the lose Rachel, but we just can't feel that pain. That's just a result of poor script and poor character development.Good film, entertaining, but surely not great or superb. Get real people, look past the hype!","

"The Dark Knight","yarborough","20 July 2008","****WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS HERE*** This movie is a monumental disappointment. I had seen all five of the previous Batman movies on the big screen, and I watched as they kept getting worse and worse and worse. I hoped that this one would break the trend (and with all the raves surrounding Heath Ledger's ""great"" performance, I really thought it would), but it did not. This movie is so trite and so absurd, and what is most reprehensible is that it suggests that there is no Good vs. Evil anymoreas a matter of fact the movie closes with Batman himself being chased by the Gotham Police(!). And constantly throughout the movie Batman (now suddenly called ""The Batman"") is seen as being the reason behind all the murders, robberies, and destruction the Joker is perpetrating in Gotham City. By the way, Gotham City here does NOT at all look like the Gotham City that we know; it is Chicago pretending to be Gotham City, which is very boring. What happened to the stunning production design that Gotham City is supposed to have?!! As for Heath Ledger, he makes a great impact in one of his first scenes in the movie (when his sudden killing of a gang member serves as the punch line to a joke), but after that scene the Joker's energy totally dwindles away and he becomes another smart-aleck, philosophical killerand even downright boring. In an attempt to keep things entertaining with the Joker, the movie resorts to dressing him in a nurse's outfit (a cheap laugh). To make a quick comparison, ""The Dark Knight"" is very much like ""Live Free or Die Hard"" (and a million other movies) in that everything is on the verge of complete destruction and chaos at the hands of a villain, and like Die Hard 4 (When are needless sequels going to stop?!!!!) it tries to replicate the feel of 9-11a real-life tragedy that should not be incorporated into comic-book stories like Batman. Batman himself makes a pathetic showing in this film, as he is much clumsier and more ineffective against the villains than ever before. But then again, why should he even try when everyone is calling him a ""vigilante killer""? When I was eight years old and saw the first Batman movie at the theater in 1989, seeing my favorite comic book character brought to life in such a stunning way was a dream-come-true. Had ""The Dark Knight"" been the movie that was released instead in 1989 (especially seeing Batman getting chased by the cops at the end), I would have been devastated. Now as an adult, I can honestly say I am disappointed.","

"The Dark Knight","baumer","1 August 2008","If there is anyone who is an anti-Batman fan, it would be me. While I thought Batman Begins was one of the best of 2005, I did not care all that much for the first four Batman films. I actually despised Batman Returns to the point that it is entrenched firmly on my top 50 worst films of all time. With that in mind, I began hearing all of the accolades this film was getting before it's release. How Heath Ledger had turned in a performance of a lifetime. How this was being called the Godfather of Comic Book films. How this film was being lauded as one of the best films in the last ten years and so on. By now, you've heard them all. And to be honest, I resented that and I believed that it was simply the scope of Heath's death that was causing this love fest with The Dark Knight. Never have I been so glad to be wrong. Not only is this film the best film I have seen since American Beauty, it is one that moved me and reminded me why I fell in love with the art of film in the first place. Christopher Nolan and Heath Ledger and everyone involved should be proud that this film transcends comic book films, and it transcends the summer popcorn genre. It is a larger than life experience and it is one of the best films ever made, in my opinion.As we all remember, the end of Batman Begins we were shown a new villain named the Joker that had been leaving his card at the scene of his crimes. This takes place shortly after that with the Joker and his henchmen robbing a bank that holds mob money. He steals a cool 68 million dollars in a well executed and highly improbable robbery. Soon he is crashing a mob meeting and introduces himself quite effectively with a disappearing pencil trick that gets everyone's attention. His thought process is that he knows the mob no longer has the respect they once did, and that is because of the Batman. He offers his services, to kill the Batman, but with a hefty price. When his prediction comes true later in the film, that the mobsters are not safe from Batman, they realize they do need him. Meanwhile, a new DA named Harvey Dent is keen on cleaning up the city in any way possible. When he realizes that Batman is actually good for the city, Bruce Wayne takes a liking to him and decides that Harvey will be his white knight. This may actually allow Bruce to live a normal life. But of course nothing goes as planned and when tragedy strikes Harvey and his loved one, all hell breaks loose in Gotham City and the Joker becomes more and more unstoppable. Soon of course we are headed down the inevitable mano a mano confrontation between Batman and The Joker, but in a way that has never been done before.The Dark Knight explores socio-political issues usually reserved for a Michael Mann film. Take one exchange between the Joker and Batman, on paper it sounds good, but to see it on screen is mesmerizing: ""Don't talk like one of them. You're not, even if you'd like to be. They need you right now. But when they don't, they'll cast you out...LIKE A LEPER. See their morals, their code...it's a bad joke...dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show ya, when the chips are down, these civilized people will EAT each other."" Batman and The Joker are separated by a fine line. But that line is often crossed in the film and when the Joker puts Batman to the test, I think they switch personalities. The film works because it has iconic characters and wonderful performances no doubt, but it also works brilliantly because it treats the audience like they are smart and perceptive. Spiderman 3 this is not.It has to be mentioned of course that Heath Ledger gives a performance that has no equal. When I think of some of the great performances in film, I think of Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, Val Kilmer in Tombstone, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood and Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, just to name a few. They have nothing on Heath. He is The Joker. You won't recognize him, you won't know that it is an actor, you will believe that there is a man named the Joker that is on screen and someone captured him on film. There is not a finer performance I can think of and if anyone wins best supporting actor this year besides him, it is their duty to thank the academy and then decline the award and give it to Heath. He is that good. The Joker is mesmerizing.The Dark Knight is a film for a generation of film lovers that has been begging for a better comic book film. This is that film. Even if you are not a big fan of these type of movies, it will win you over.10/10","

"The Dark Knight","Robsnide","5 September 2010","'The Dark Knight's box-office takings were recently overtaken by those of 'Toy Story 3'. Frankly, I'm not at all surprised. The Disney picture blows this away in terms of sheer entertainment. What Christopher Nolan does not seem to have grasped is the utter absurdity of the main character - 'Batman' is a nut who runs round Gotham City in a rubber suit solving crimes. The 1966 series/movie with Adam West and Burt Ward got him about right - it was played entirely for laughs. 'T.D.K.' takes him very seriously indeed - big mistake. Christian Bale is bland as 'Wayne/Batman', and Heath Ledger's 'Joker' cannot hold a bat-candle compared to Cesar Romero's and Jack Nicholson's earlier portrayals ( had Ledger not been foolish enough to die just before the film opened, I doubt whether anyone would have given it the time of day ). 'T.D.K.' also squanders the talents of the lovely Maggie Gyllenhaal ( brilliant in 'Secretary' ). The film as a whole is bleak, ugly and depressing - not my idea of a fun movie at all. I think I'll stick with the excellent Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher quartet of the '80's/90's. No more 'edgy' Batman pictures, okay?","

The other star goes to the bat-cycle, which is the only cool device/gadget in the film. Everything else is a disappointment.Christian Bale -- Could somebody please wake him up. Heath Ledger -- ""De mortuis, nihil nisi bonum."" He avoided the snarling giggles of Nicholson and Romero and is a bit funny now and again, but I do not remember the Joker being a sado-masochist. The character remains a cartoon villain. Michael Caine -- An eighty year old butler. Pathetic. Sorry to say, but they really needed a younger man for the part. Script. -- a half decent first draft. Three or four more drafts and it might have amounted to something. With the exception of Dent, none of the characters are worth caring about. That's its major flaw. Production -- Dazzlingly cruddy. All the sets and props underwhelm. No real style is established. Cinematography -- Only one nice shot in the movie, when the Joker blows up a hospital. It is nice, but not great and only marginally memorable. Every other shot looks like a cheesy CBS crime show.I'm glad I waited until the last week of its run in the $2 movie theaters to see it. I would have hated to think I wasted $10 on this. I won't be getting the DVD. Please, do not give it to me for Christmas.I once got fired from a newspaper for giving a bad review to Tim Burton's ""Batman"". In retrospect, every ""Batman"" has been worse since then. Burton's first ""Batman"" is looking better and better all the time. I should mention that the film fails to establish meaning in its narrative. It constantly strives to do this by having the characters speak in deep voices and intone such nonsensical lines as ""If you stay around long enough, either you die a hero or end up a villain."" By saying such trite nonsense in serious tones, you don't make the movie serious, only seriously trite and nonsensical.I was bored after the first half hour and the next two hours seemed like three or four, as I hoped, in vain, the movie would become interesting.","

"The Dark Knight","malikroberts16","13 June 2009","There's one thing about ""The Dark Knight"" that I just don't get... why? Why do so much people make it out to be something that it's not? I don't call it a masterpiece for enough reasons.1) I didn't find it gripping, and I thought it was schmaltzy as hell, just like all the movies I see these days 2) Sure, it was good, but it's not a masterpiece because I don't call it groundbreaking, despite the fact that it made a helluva lot of money and was the biggest-grossing movie of 2008. Honestly, even I've seen better and I'm almost 17! I don't think it's the kind of movie that leaves a mark on the worldwide consciousness and it doesn't mean much to me personally3) It was WAY, WAY, over-anticipated.I honestly don't know if there's any ground left to break, but sure, we can still show audiences that artistry and business shouldn't be two different things. I'd really like to see Hollywood do more stuff like that. Bottom line, what was good back in the Golden Age is still good now. I think both the American people and people all over the world can still handle craftsmanship. I gave the movie 6 stars out of 10 just to be generous.I'd love to see someone pull it off but I don't know if they'd have the guts.To call ""The Dark Knight"" a masterpiece is to say that the viewer clearly has not seen a wide range of films.You wanna know what a real masterpiece is? Give ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", the first two ""Star Wars"" films, ""Casablanca"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", or the first two Indiana Jones films a try and think about it.","

"The Dark Knight","VoiceOfEurope","2 September 2008","This is the biggest ridicule after George W. not being able to spell the word 'nuclear' right. It is simply beyond my understanding how hundreds of thousands of people could have rated this film even worthy of attention. Batman, The Dark Knight is a piece of cake. With capital letters.OK, a huge fat turkey of a movie is not a new kid on the block. But no piece of trash has ever been so over-rated as this one is. I know that Heath Ledger's death came unexpected, and the guy was a solid actor, but you cannot praise something to the skies out of commiseration and loyalty. 'Cause however hard I am trying I am not able to find any other substantial reason why you would give Christopher Nolan's new embarrassment of an action flick six, seven, eight or nine points, let alone ten.This movie is lacking a consequent plot, a cohesion of the myriad of action scenes it has been broken down into and a common sense to know when enough is enough. Besides, I really don't know which film those who said the acting was brilliant had watched, but what I see is that Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhal and Gary Oldman all lack conviction and had the end of the day - and probably the collection of money - in mind when they stood in position in front of the blue screen. Oh, and quite often I really got confused; from time to time I needed to be reminded I was not watching the new James Bond movie or Terminator CXXXVIII (the gadget scene, the plane escape scene are truly pathetic, as is the concept of (re)introducing the character of Two-Face, the guy who did not read the instructions manual of the microwave oven).Since we are talking about a comic book adaptation I don't bother to mention how unrealistic action sequences are (try wiring a town hospital with all that security and CCTV cameras they got installed, or try buying - unnoticed - the oil reserves of a medium sized country to blow half of the city into the sky), but let me ask why nobody out of the immense crew that put this film together could pay attention to small details. Like when police forces storm the Hong Kong building to catch the bat-suit guy: 'Arigato, arigato!'- they wave each other up the stairs. Does this mean China needs to hire law enforcement personnel from Japan? OK, I am stopping there. I know I might already have made some enemies among comic book and action film lovers. This forgettable encounter with Batman however, reminds me again I am not one of them.","

"The Dark Knight","sebpopcorn","27 February 2009","I've been a fan of Batman since I was a kid so I didn't need much persuading to see the latest movie especially with everyone saying how good it is. Shame I didn't read page two of the reviews before seeing it! The story is overly long, disjointed and goes nowhere. Seriously what was that whole Hong Kong thing about? The bombings are highly contrived and would have been more credible if the film was going for a cheeky jokey style but it tries to be serious and doesn't have any logic to it.I really can't believe the rave reviews this movie got, it's at best a three out of ten. I had no expectations but still came out feeling let down. I had to watch the original movie afterwards which has a plot, interesting characters and a Batman that doesn't sound ridiculous every time he opens his mouth. A crap effort all round, but people are loving it which explains why Hollywood puts zero effort into most movies and lots of effort into advertising.It's not even visually interesting except for the odd shot where it looks quite gritty. Compared to the wonderful scenes of Gotham from the first movie though this is nothing to get excited about. By the way at the time of writing people rate this movie 4 places higher than Casablanca, unbelievable.","

"The Dark Knight","Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews","18 July 2008","The best superhero movie ever. The whole movie i never lost interest and there were moments of almost unbearable suspense. I have never been more excited to see a movie.The Joker was excellent. The first time i went on to the Dark knight page i saw that The Joker was going to be played by Heath Ledger. I thought Heath Ledger? really. I thought he would suck. Then i saw the trailer then my 'Heath is gonna suck' thoughts were blown up in my face he looked awesome.When i left the movie i thought he was beyond awesome he was incredible. He had delivered the best performance from anyone that i have seen. It was like Hannibal Lector only better. If he doesn't win the awards then the awards are rigged. When i see characters being portrayed all i see is a actor. When i saw Ledger's Joker i saw a sadistic maniac. Sadly Heath Ledger died. This is a perfect performance to have on your final(completed)film.I highly recommend this. Nolan really knows how to make a movie. Every single thing in this movie was superb(except for Bale's Batman voice). Drop everything and go see it now. It was worth the wait. It is one of my favorites.10/10","

"The Dark Knight","john3-2","5 July 2009","I'm probably one of the last people in the world to see this movie, and I'm glad I didn't spend $10+ to see it in the theaters. Technically, the effects are amazing, and Heath Ledger does give a very good performance as The Joker (though crazy people are the easiest characters to portray IMHO). My issues with the film are: Batman resorts to physical torture in several scenes. The Batman I know would scare criminals, mostly through the fear of the mysterious ""bat man"". However, dropping a crime boss off a building to break his ankles is pretty extreme, and even his treatment of The Joker in the interrogation room is over the top.The film has too many plot lines...romance triangle, Two Face, both add extra baggage. The ""Two Face"" story line (coupled with a love triangle) could be a film on its own. And how about the Wayne Enterprises employee who was going to reveal Batman? Plot holes galore....I can suspend my disbelief and let Batman ""fly"", but how can the Joker sneak explosives into hospitals and ferry boats in MASSIVE quantities without anyone noticing? Too long by about 30 minutes. If they had trimmed a few plot lines it might have worked better.So enjoyable to watch, and probably a 7 rather than a 5, but I feel I need to vote down a bit to offset all the crazy 10 ratings.","

"The Dark Knight","lee_eisenberg","27 July 2008","Continuing on from ""Batman Begins"", Christopher Nolan has now given us ""The Dark Knight"", an equally brilliant achievement. Here we have the Caped Crusader (Christian Bale) battling The Joker (Heath Ledger in a blood-chilling final performance), while also trying to navigate the cesspool of crime and corruption that pervades Gotham City.I will say that I found the movie a little silly whenever Batman converses with someone. But what really impressed me was Harvey Dent's (Aaron Eckhart) role. As Gotham's hotshot DA, he represents hope for wiping out all crime; Batman is mostly known as a vigilante. And he can only be known as such, because...well, I'll let you find out what it means.You may have heard that this is a dark movie. Especially The Joker. Whereas Jack Nicholson's Joker was basically a live action Bugs Bunny, Heath Ledger's Joker is a maniacal, ruthless, vicious thug; he seeks only the creation, promotion and dissemination of pure chaos. And there are some REALLY intense scenes throughout the movie; not necessarily violent, but definitely not for the fainthearted.All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this one. While I could predict some of what was going to happen, much of it surprised me. It will probably surprise you too. Also starring Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and small appearances by Cillian Murphy and Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy.","

"The Dark Knight","kooleshwar","13 August 2008","Media Hype and Crowd Behaviour!!!! While lots of research has been done on this clearly its not enough, while there are lots of other points in this movie that merit study, it quite clearly this seemingly unrelated and external factors that determine the outcome of watching this movie.Well here are some dark truths, which after saying I expect the same vicious backlash that I would get after telling any other person something he doesn't want to hear.Truth No 1 - This is hardly a Batman film, as a person who grew up seeing the original TV series and cartoons and reading the original comics, and even the original movies, I can tell you that batman was always about humour even though i may not have been a fan of the almost comic TV series, even the comics had a sense of humour about them, besides as in any comic movie the comic is always about the man in the costume.What we have a here is multi-million modern urban social crime drama, with Batman only being used as the director to indulge in a socio-urban setting which a normal budget would not have allowed him, THE ACTION SCENES ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN.AND NO MATTER WHAT WHO SAYS WHAT THE F@#K HAPPENED TO THE NEO-Gothic LOOK OF GOTHAM DOWN TO THE OLD FASHIONED CARS AND PINSTRIPED SUITED CRIMINALS THAT WE HAVE ENJOYED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF BATMAN IN ALL MEDIUMS AND ACROSS ALL TIMES.Truth no 2 - This is not a movie to be watched by children even in they are accompanied by their parents, I've SPOKEN TO THE CHILDREN WHO I PLAY WITH IN THE PARK (i claim my mental age is 12 and i love children), AND EACH AND EVERYONE HATED IT, there was a time where comics were meant for children and teens,and if nothing else was at least fun for all age groups, but now its the medium for artistically inclined serious adults who want to see REAL PEOPLE WITH SUPERHUMAN POWERS.Oh please give me the superfantastical superhero of yore anyday.Truth no 3 - He may be dead but that does not mean that this is the best performance by any actor ever AND HELL EVEN IN IT IS A SINGLE STUPENDOUS PERFORMANCE Doesn't MAKE A MOVIE THE BEST MOVIE EVER at least have the common sense to the final result as the sum of all its factors.Just because the critics and the publicity managers tell you that it was the final greatest performance by a person who was disturbed enough to commit suicide doesn't mean we exhibit herd mentality and all go with the flow.It was a great performance NOT THE GREATEST EVER.truth no 4 - This movie had 2 climaxes, there were people in the theater who were ready to leave after a certain scene in the movie because they didn't know there was another character that was yet to be introduced, this movie was very very long, and that scene i waited for the movie to get over. In fact IT WAS THE LONG WAIT AFTER WHAT I THOUGHT WAS AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF THE MOVIE THAT RUINED MOST OF THE MOVIE FOR ME.truth no 5......................well what the hell i can go on rambling but im going to be judged anyway so im going to end here.Some truths that everyone will like.The performances from everyone were great.The background score was very good but it always sounded like the movie was climaxing instead of just moving forward.WHATEVER THE FACTS MAY BE THE END RESULT FOR ME WAS A GOOD MOVIE THAT WAS MADE LESS GOOD BY THE unnecessary hype and the coinciding herd mentality.Maybe this movie was less suited to my tastes, but at least i deserve to told what im getting into, im hoping this is like ang lees hulk that was loved by critics and their followers initially but later people realised that may be they didn't like this movie that much after all, BUT THEN AGAIN NOBODY DIED WHILE MAKING THAT MOVIE....-s WHY SO SERIOUS?? not like the batman i expected, very long, over-hyped.+/-s not a movie for all audiences....+s superb performances all around, good soundtrack, some memorable scenes.total 6/10 (THE PERFORMANCE (you know whose im talking about), was indeed very good but the overall product fell well below my expectations if i wanted to watch a crime drama (which i don't like much anyway since i get majorly put of by crime) i would re-watch godfather or any other such movie.GIVE THE BATMAN OF YORE ANYDAY (exlude batman and robin).ps i expect to be judged and ridiculed, so bring it on, i have my own opinions which im proud to say are based on my own tastes and not by those of drama-tragedy loving critics and crowds driven to a frenzy by media hype.","

"The Dark Knight","Zaffy-1","23 August 2008","I watched it yesterday. I came here to read user comments and I was :O, No 3 movie of all times?If it wasn't 3 hours LONG I would go and re-watch it just to see what did I miss that most of you loved so much. I honestly fail to see what all this hype-hysteria is about..First of all I think the film is way too long than it should be and got to be repetitive after one point. I mean how many times you need to see Joker doing the same things to understand that he is a very intelligent maniac/schizo/sociopath/whatever and can trick and manipulate everyone? Yes we got it, Joker is a schizophrenic genius or whatever, like Ledger's irritating acting wasn't enough. Oh yes, there are many horribly given Oscars out there you will soon can add one more for Heath for probably the worst performance of his career. If that wonderful and extremely talented actor was still alive he wouldn't even get an nomination. Except if you think that talking like crazy and overusing your tongue tick to show you are unstable is a first class acting. I thought Jack Nickolson typecasts but his Joker was a masterpiece comparing to Ledger's. Its really unfortunate that for this caricature acting he will be remembered and honored.The only performance worth of mentioning was Gary Oldman's. As for the rest of the movie, directing was first class, art direction not bad, cinematography was OK, the music was good, the script was.....What was the script about again? OK its a comic so that could justify the numerous plot holes (I can't even imagine how Joker with the help of mentally ill people can trap a whole city like this, not to mention the ridiculous two-face unreal makeup to name a few..). What else the script was about? That you can only beat chaotic terrorists by bending human rights (the mobiles sonar system) but its OK if you only do it once? hmmm dangerous! That good in people always beats evil? yeah! that! it 's like ethics for dummies...but maybe this is what young people need now-days, basic ethics and values teached by a rather boring Hollywood Movie. Which now makes me understand why it is rated so high.. doh.. hmmm dangerous.. learning values from Hollywood...","

"The Dark Knight","ddfcmp8","15 December 2008","There is nothing special about this movie. Period. Nothiing special. It tries on so many levels to be this big mega movie, and in financial terms, it was, but you know what? It's still not good, no matter how many fans it has, no matter how much money it pulls in. Those are just figures and numbers, and they're quite boring in the long run. Let's go over a few reasons why it was not good. First off, the story bites off way more than is necessary. We have Bruce Wayne in this ridiculous attempt to win back a woman he'll never have the chance to be with. The woman he is in love with prances around like a little school girl, and really has no business being in the story to begin with. She is just there to make both Batman and Harvey Dent rival each other. I'm so sure that the writers could have come up with a better plan to pit the two against each other than that. Then, there's the Joker...the most ridiculous part of the story. Ridiculous because of the lengths and the means that the filmmakers took to bring a new kind of villain. It's not entertaining, it's not disturbing, it's just sick. This movie was not fun. It was not entertaining. It was a product for the mindless audiences who were going to buy into it anyway, and especially because of the death of Heath edger. Let's talk a little about that. This film had success that rode the curtail of Ledgers death. The studio deliberately used the poor suffering of a human being to push a film into exhibition. That's really sad, and you know what else? It's all this film will ever be...the last film of Heath Ledger, and America went to see it because he died before it's release. sad. Really sad. I didn't like it, and I bet others will not like me for that very reason. Even more sad still.","

This movie is an undeniable profound masterwork that absolutely exceeds expectations and transcends the comic book genre into profound philosophical themes that are not only unexpected, but actually present a pristine depiction of their impacts and ramifications.

"The Dark Knight","mausar","8 August 2008","When I read the enthusiastic reviews in Italy and I saw this movie ranked 1st in the IMDb's Top 250, I thought: ""It's strange, the other Batman (Begins) was not so brilliant, what's happening with this sequel? Is it really this masterpiece? Is it really in the same league with movies like 'Clockwork Orange' or 'Apocalypse now'?"". No, it's not in the same league. Not at all. When I saw it, my delusion was strong. It's a good blockbuster action movie, but nothing more. Let's see.The following comments contain spoilers. Be careful.The script is not so original. There are tons of action sequences, but what can I say? I've seen it all. I've seen the robbery made by violent people, fighting against the guards and killing each others (in all pulp tradition, since ""Reservoir Dogs""). I've seen the ransom in China by plane (""Spy Games""). I've seen those action sequences with cars and armored vehicles in all American movies. (And this Batmobile is really awkward). I've seen the killer who kills by chance (""No Country for Old Men""). I've seen the super-mega-sadistic-mad-chaotic-evil-serial-killer in action who creates dilemmas and plays with his victims (in ""Seven"" and in the ""Saw"" saga). I've seen it all: ""The Dark Knight"" is nothing new. And it's very predictable: you really can predict any sequence before seeing it. There are a lot of absurdities. The heroes could kill The Joleker dozens of times, but they never do it. Why? Are they retarded? The ""two ships dilemma"" (I don't want to reveal more about that scene) is not realistic at all. There are only a couple of surprises, but the 2/3 of the movie doesn't create any suspense. What about the actors? The only two heroes of acting in this movie are Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart. Heath Ledger, with his Joker, bears quite the entire movie. All the other characters became secondary. Aaron Eckhart is really powerful and he confirms his talent shown in ""Thank You for Smoking"". What about the others? Christian Bale is one of the most talented actors of his generation, but in this movie he keeps only one expression all the time, with or without mask. His Batman has no personality. Maggie Gyllenhaal is one of the most interesting (and underrated) independent actresses of the New Hollywood, since ""The Secretary"". But in this movie she can act only in few sequences and she has no chance to show her real talent. Morgan Freeman and Michael Cane are giants, but in this movie they barely appear. Finally: I've never seen so many waste of talent! The good side of the coin in Christopher Nolan's work is: his philosophy. It's really positive and constructive and all his movie is coherent about it. It's just like the positive answer to ""No Country for Old Men"" and to modern nihilism: in the Cohen's movie, Evil is the absence of values and it's unstoppable. In ""The Dark Knight"", Evil is again the absence of values, but it's a minority, not the rule. So, we can fight Evil and defeat it, with or without super-heroes. But all those themes could be and should be explored better. ""The Dark Knight"" explores nothing.","

"The Dark Knight","JTMokko","19 April 2011","I gave this film a one just to pull down the overall score of the film - it doesn't deserve the 10th place on top 250 list. There is no way that this film deserves ten points! Heath Ledger was great in his role as a Joker - no doubt about that. His early departure from the land of the living makes his role stand out in many peoples minds and give a extra glitter to whole movie. Without Joker this film would have much less ten point votes.Story really was bloated with too many characters - most of them just showing their face in the movie without any significance to the main storyline. Scarecrow and batman-boys (or what they were called) were totally unnecessary bypassers in the first half of the movie. Story was all over the place and it didn't have the consistency or the red line that it could follow. Many scenes were just boring and ridiculous. This film really didn't give nothing good to the whole Batman saga.","

"The Dark Knight","bobsgrock","20 July 2008","It's pretty obvious now, here only three days after The Dark Knight premiered in theaters that this movie is one of the best of the year as well as the best Batman movie ever as well as the best superhero movie ever as well as one of the better crime epics over the last fifty years. Critics and fans all over the world universally agree with the above comments. I have to say, I agree as well.There are multiple reasons as to why this film is so successful. The first and most obvious one is that of the performance of Heath Ledger. Like everyone else, Ledger creeps the heck out of the audience whenever he comes on screen and completely dominates every scene he is in. The character of the Joker here is so different from Jack Nicholson, even from the cartoon version in the animated series, which was quite good. Here, there are some jokes, but none too funny. Whatever the Joker does, he does only for self-entertainment or to cause extreme havoc and chaos. His character his developed enough to show that he has no remorse and even no reason to feel the way he does. If you want to spend money on a good movie, go see this one if only for Ledger's terrifying, Oscar-worthy performance, which is better in its short time than most other characters in whole movies.Other reasons attributed to this film's success is that of Christian Bale, who is just becoming more and more perfect as Bruce Wayne, the arrogant and smugly rich billionaire who has his own dark side in his alter ego. Bale is so likable and looks so good in the suit, it's hard to think that anyone else, even George Clooney, could play Batman. The supporting cast is good, including Maggie Gyllenhaal who makes the character of Rachel Dawes even better than Katie Holmes did, as well as Aaron Eckhart, bringing a warm and comfortable sense to the character of Harvey Dent, yet can still match the powerful sense of pain and anger he expresses when he is Two-Face.Still, perhaps the biggest reason why this film is not just popular but great is because of director Christopher Nolan. Nolan, already a hit with Memento, Batman Begins and The Prestige completely outdoes himself with flawless direction and incredible pacing during this two and a half hour epic that covers everything needed. The action sequences are some of the best I have ever seen filmed. The script from Nolan and his brother is really good with some excellent dialogue discussing serious subjects such as crime and the moral weights that affect all decisions we make. Mostly, this is more than a superhero movie. It feels more like a crime drama epic more reminiscent of Michael Mann or Martin Scorsese. The cinematography is perfect and completes the whole mood of this film: dark, depressing, and gloomy. Yet, there is still good being done in Gotham City.The Dark Knight is there and he will never leave. And while I wasn't completely satisfied with the way things wrapped up, I am sure it was the right way to do it. So, save your money and don't bother getting popcorn or soda to have during the film. This is a completely engrossing and captivating picture that requires all attention. It may just win Best Picture in February, and what a treat that would be.","

"The Dark Knight","DKosty123","1 August 2008","This film is long at over 2 1/2 hours but that is because it does so much right that it takes that long to do the job. Everyone in the cast is terrific. The action is almost non-stop for this film too.Michael Caine is even better in this film than he was in Batman Begins. Morgan Freeman who has been busy this year (also in Wanted this summer) is fantastic. The film has times where the action is so intense that you almost get lost but it picks you up and doesn't let you get lost. Kudos to Christian Bale as he is even better here than in Batman Begins.Heath Ledger as the Joker is the big story. This is not a Joker like before, as this one is totally out there (and don't ask me where there is). His criminal activity is defined as unusually bizarre. He says it himself when he says in the movie that he just goes where he wants without any reason for what he is doing. The Joker actually starts the film robbing a bank. By the end of the movie, he has made that bank robbery seem and actually be pointless. The robbery is just a place to start the movie.The film starts dark & ends darker with very little light in the middle. It kills off people often and even one of the main roles is killed. It gives viewers a delightful UN-predictability not just too the Joker but to where the film is going.That is pretty much what makes this film go. I doubt than any film will top it this year. It even leaves Wanted in the dust grasping to catch up.","

"The Dark Knight","mihaly_bora","22 July 2008","I've never read any Batman comics, I only saw the films and few episodes from the excellent animated series when I was about 10. Batman '89 is still one of my favorite movies (mainly because of emotional reasons), along with Batman Begins which was a very good movie too. I was really hyped about The Dark Knight and like Batman Begins, it is a very, very good movie, though not the best. Let's start with the cons first.CONS Two and a half hours were a bit long for me, they could have done it in 2 hours and it still would have had this same resonance with the audiences IMO. Two unnecessary story lines: Mr. Reese and Hongkong, especially Hongkong. It was a nice little sequence, but not too important.Batman's voice: Too much, I almost laughed.Scarecrow: the character deserved so much more than what he finally got, I hope he'll be back for the third ride. He was a real threat to Batman in the first movie.Rachel: now I believe it was the character itself all along, not Katie Holmes. She simply didn't work, I'm kinda glad she's out.Music: most of the time it was excellent, but it annoyed the hell out of me in some places.PROS Greatly crafted story, full of twists and turns, though I felt a definite anti-climax during the ending sequences. A wanted a bigger showdown between the Batman and the Joker, I guess the writers wanted to save that for another movie.Christian Bale's Batman: apart from his growling voice, very, very good like in Batman Begins, though I think he should have got more screen time.Aaron Eckhart's Harvey/Two-Face: the real steal of the show, he was bloody brilliant. I hope he'll also be back for the third movie as the main baddie, his Two-Face was very threatening.Heath Ledger's Joker: I won't go into details, but I guess the greatest compliment I could give him is that I hated the Joker, I couldn't stand this psychopath.Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon: He was Gary Oldman. Enough said.:) Brilliant and the character was very well written.Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were superb as well, so the cast was top-notch.SUMMARY So, the film was very good, but not great (only in my opinion!!! Fans, don't shoot me!). The Dark Knight is NOT a comic book movie, perhaps that's the reason I'm not as thrilled about it as other people (which DOESN'T mean the film isn't excellent), for me the concept of Batman doesn't really work in the real world as it worked in Burton's fantastic Gotham. But comparisons with Batman '89 are kinda fruitless, the styles are so different, it's impossible for me to decide which is better. Like the Ledger vs. Nicholson debate. Nicholson's Joker worked perfectly in Burton's version as did Ledger's in Nolan's, the two universes could coexist together perfectly.7 and a half out of 10. I want a third movie right away with Scarecrown and Two-Face (I hope the latter didn't die).:)","

"The Dark Knight","puffball97","11 August 2008","Why is ""The Dark Knight"" so serious? For many good reasons. Christopher Nolan is a true auteur who can take a simplistic comic book story like ""Batman"" and turn it into a complex psychological movie with plethora of character study. He has directed Christian Bale into the most serious Batman character of all. He sure did direct the late Heath Ledger into performing as the best Joker of them all, and Ledger did not work to upstage Bale or the other actors in any way. Ledger should definitely win a posthumous Oscar for his scary performance of a clown who possesses deep wounds.If Christopher Nolan was old enough, he should have done Batman movies instead of Tim Burton or Joel Schumacher put together. Tim Burton's mood was dark as well, but as I'm looking at it now, Michael Keaton was a more sloppy Batman, Kim Basinger was a mousy Vicky Vale, and Jack Nicholson overdid his Joker performance. In ""Batman Returns,"" also directed by Burton and starring Keaton, the commercialism continues, adding Michelle Pfeiffer as a more idiotic Catwoman than the Catwomen on the 1960s TV series and Danny DeVito, who still was a wounded Penguin, but not enough that we feel sorry for him. Then in the mid 1990s, Keaton didn't want to play Batman anymore, feeling he was upstaged by all the villains. Looking for more actors often typecast as villains, director Schumacher got Tommy Lee Jones to parody his villain persona as Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent. Also, there was still that rubberface persona in Jim Carrey as the Riddler as well. 1997's ""Batman and Robin"" was a total washout. So Nolan came to rescue this moribund franchise and made his own franchise moody with dark colors, mature, less focus on the action and more on the story and detailed development of each character without exploiting them. In 2005, ""Batman Begins"" was just the beginning, but ""The Dark Knight"" is the real story. It would be sin that Christopher Nolan does not get nominated for an Oscar, just as well as Heath Ledger, for best director.Christian Bale is, and many people would agree with me, the best Batman of them all. With his rich performance, we do know him better than Adam West, Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, and George Clooney put together. We know Bruce Wayne's haunted past and demons, and why he becomes his alter ego Batman to fight crime in Gotham City. Unlike Cesar Romero and Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger is a much more complicated joker. He doesn't torture people just for pure torture. He doesn't laugh maliciously between every single sentence. He grew up with such an abusive upbringing that he wants to exploit Batman as a fraud for Gotham City, even bringing in Batman clones with the typical Caped Crusader outfit on the crime scenes just to tell Bruce Wayne ""Will the real Batman stand up?""All the other actors give excellent, detailed performances. Maggie Gyllenhal gives a stronger performance than Katie Holmes (Mrs. Tom Cruise) as Bruce Wayne's love interest Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes, but is smitten with D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) in the end. Gary Oldman, in one of his few good-guy roles, does a fine turn as the mustachioed Commissioner Gordon, more serious than the one we've seen on TV. Veteran thespians Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are always a treat to watch as the faithful butler Alfred and the gadget inventor Lucius Fox. These two men get better with age each time they make movies. And Aaron Eckhart plays Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent not as a torturous villain like Tommy Lee Jones did before, but as a victim wounded by the Joker's torture in a gas chamber out to seek revenge with his coin as his calling card for what could be good or what could better yet turn out for bad on his intended targets.The summer of 2008 had a lot of movies. I've seen ""Mamma Mia"" as a light feel-good musical comedy riddled with off-key singing, notably by Pierce Brosnan. I've seen ""Wall-E,"" which I thought was Pixar's blander efforts. Remy the rat from last year upstaged this robot on all costs. But ""The Dark Knight"" is the best movie of the summer. When it comes to comic book stories, as I said before, directors Burton and Schumacher got all caught up in themselves with too much action and seemed to forget their audiences. Nolan never does.","

"The Dark Knight","CineCritic2517","26 September 2008","A below average film which went on far too long. Heath Ledger didn't completely fail at portraying The Joker, but to compare him with Nicholson and favor him is insulting to both their careers. He's essentially just playing a rather generic psychotic role in the mantle of the joker and can't really dazzle anymore after a scene or four. Christian Bale is like a fossilized chunk of wood in his role as Bruce Wayne and as (the) Batman just seemed to be in the wrong movie and desperately in need of some antibiotics.Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were fortunately able to add credibility to it all and when they appeared on screen, the movie was actually pretty great. Pity though that they only got about 1 % of the movie's screen time. Aaron Eckhardt was given nada to work with and was equally wasted. But who can really be surprised watching a movie like this. Just too many inane plot turns which just pulls you further and further away from wanting to find out where it all was heading. I Walked out after the 100 minute mark to get a smoke and just couldn't bother to walk back into the theater.The evening was saved approaching a charming girl at the cinema bar serving ridiculously overpriced, yet abhorrently tasting cocktails. We ended up at her place and we danced to K&D until the first rays of morning sunlight found their way through the ragged drapes covering a cracked windowpane. As she peeled of my clothes as if I was an overripe tangerine, she whispered softly in my ear a mantra of passion.Film: 1/**** Night: 4/****","

"The Dark Knight","Chrysanthepop","31 July 2008","Finally the wait is over. Quite obviously, 'The Dark Knight' is THE most waited film of Summer 2008. It is indeed an exciting action film but, in addition, it does delve deeper than the common action movies. What really makes 'The Dark Knight' stand out is the writing (especially the dialogues which are clever, amusing and thought-provoking), performances and of course, it is the skilled Christopher Nolan's direction that puts it all together, telling an exciting story. It's got substance and the themes are well presented. This time Batman's character is a lot more complex as he's faced with contradicting situations of which he has to make a choices. The character is a good 'continuation' from the prequel (where he's just started with the new identity whereas now he faces the disadvantages and complexities of being Batman).While the writers deserve all the praise for brilliantly defining the characters, it is the actor's job to bring them to life and credit goes to Nolan for retaining most of the better actors of 'Batman Begins' (namely Bale, Freeman and the one and only Caine) and the new cast includes a host of great names like Eckhart, Gyllenhaal, Oldman and of course Ledger. Christian Bale excellently carries off Wayne/Batman. In my opinion, his Batman is much more convincing and intriguing than what Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney offered. Maggie Gyllenhaal is obviously a tremendous improvement over Katie Holmes (the worst thing in 'Batman Begins'). She maintains a great chemistry with Bale and Eckhart and is far from the typical damsel in distress. Aaron Eckhart is totally awesome and Gary Oldman, Eric Roberts and Michael Caine (always dependable) hold their own and do nothing short of a great job. A barely recognizable Heath Ledger delivers a memorable last performance. He reminded me of the late Brandon Lee in 'The Crow'. His Joker is menacing, wickedly funny, insane and cunning. I especially liked that he always said that he didn't plan anything (when this was clearly a lie).The energy-filled action scenes are plentiful and well executed. The dramatic sequences are well balanced and convincing. The cinematography and sound effects are very effective and the score works fantastically.The only downers for me were that the pace wasn't steady as it gets slightly slow towards the end. Bale's Batman voice was overdone. I can understand that the voice needed to sound different from Bruce Wayne's but this one sounded too awkward and too artificial. I would have liked to see how Rachel's death affected Batman. Nolan demonstrates well how it influences Harvey but not much of how Batman dealt with it (especially since it was the consequence of a choice he made). Yet, overall, it is a very well executed film that is darkly entertaining and exciting. I can understand why so many love it.","

"The Dark Knight","emdeewee","10 March 2010","A few arguments to show how mediocre this movie really is: two ships, having the choice of killing each other, or being killed. If every ship will be blown up at midnight anyway, what kind of choice is that? It is certain death, so pushing the button seems the only choice you have. The only way to survive is to push. It is no real dilemma. The weakest Batman in history. Being saved several times by humble earthlings. Carrying a suit that is not up for dog bites but yes for bullets? Further: the least interesting. Where is the psychology?Morgan Freeman's character: the whole city is burning, hospitals are exploding, people on ferries about to kill each other, and he's making a point of privacy? How can a joker have no sense of humor? Scary at times, he is as flat as a penny. A bit of humor, the dark one that is, would have made him really dangerous. Now he is but a nut. The whole point of a joker is that he is bad as hell, but charming too. He makes you fall in love with evil. Ledger did excellent with how little he was given.Harvey Dent: turns into a revengeful monster in seconds? Psychologically so empty: first all he wants is good, then all he wants is revenge. 'They took her away from me'. Such a stereotype.Chris Nolan seems to be: humorless, wanting to distract the viewer from a hollow story by means of flashes and effects.","

"The Dark Knight","g-bodyl","17 December 2008","This is the best movie of 2008 and possibly the best movie I have ever seen. This movie rivals the third Lord of the Rings movie for my favorite motion picture. After you see this, you will never view Batman in the same way even if you hate Batman. The new villain in this movie is no other than what Jack Nicholson played in the original Batman, the Joker. The only words to describe the Joker and the late Heath Ledger's performance is: shockingly amazing. If you do not feel anything like the chills when the Joker is on the screen, I regret to inform you that you must have something wrong. The Joker is not the normal, ruthless evil guy. He is much more than that. The other actors did a fine job in their respective parts: Christian Bale as Batman, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Michael Caine as Alfred, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel( a good improvement over Katie Holmes), Gary Oldman as Gordon, and Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face/Harvey Dent. The overall tone of the movie is way darker that Batman Begins. There is more action and even some humor(from the Joker.) The car chases are great, too. The music is appropriate for the tone. The score by Zimmer and Newton-Howard is deeper, darker than what you would expect. If this movie could win one Oscar, the award should go to Heath Ledger as Best Supporting Actor. We'll see what happens in February. Overall, this is a fantastic film that is more violent that Batman Begins. I rate this movie 10/10, should be 100/10.","

"The Dark Knight","Chris Knipp","21 July 2008","The new Batman film is out and it has triumphed as only a blockbuster can. It has made more money in less time than any other American mega-buck movie before it. It has brought the audience to its knees. Something approaching $200 million (enough to make 100 French art films) got spent on it, but soon the expenditures will be recouped. Wow. Good job, Chris Nolan.'The Dark Knight' tears up the screen. Villainy, as embodied in the triumphant and voluptuous posthumous performance of Heath Ledger as The Joker, so spills over Gotham that it seeps into the hearts and minds of the leaders of the Good Guys. That's what they mean by 'Dark.' Gotham is No Country for Old Men.What's happening to superheros these days anyway? Hancock (Will Smith) is a foul-mouthed drunk who causes major damage. The new Batman movie raises the issue that vigilante justice, even meted out by a chiseled millionaire with glowing skin, encourages lawlessness and may over all be a Bad Thing. The Joker is a sadistic lord of misrule. He has serious childhood issues, but he only uses them to tease and torment people (""know how I got these scars?""). To hell with money, he says, setting fire to a two-storey Step Pyramid of bundles of cash--prompting thoughts of the drooping dollar, Bush's war, and the way Hollywood throws money at a franchise like this one. His pleasure is all in sowing the seeds of chaos. And it's his movie. We don't see that much of Batman, or much other than his masked face, and the Joker is just way more fun to watch.Ledger-The-Joker tears apart the movie, too--yet seems sometimes all that's holding it together. Punctuated by his appearances, The Dark Knight barely comes to life till he shows up twenty minutes in, then is shaped by his always-flashy and riveting turns. But the movie is troubled by its own chaos. It's too long, and grows increasingly incoherent toward the end.Noise is pervasive, urging the audience to be excited from the first frame. This is always a problem with any film, especially a very complicated one like this: if you start out at too high a pitch, it'll be hard to sustain that and if you do sustain it, you risk wearing out the audience. Contrast the 'Bourne' movies. They're pitched high, hard and fast, but they're essentially simple chase stories with the hero in nearly every scene so they hold momentum easily. 'The Dark Knight' has us following too many different forces, and who's aligned with what gets too blurred. DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhardt), Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale), the DA's new--and Bruce Wayne's old--girlfriend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllanhaal), Wayne/Batman's loyal sidekicks Fox (Morgan Freeman) and Alfred (Michael Caine)--the latter two film idols who grab the screen and create a void around themselves (they're shot that way too). There's also police lieutenant Gordan (Gary Oldman), perhaps the least interesting yet nearly the most important character, and a mayor (Nestor Carbonell) with huge eyebrows and black-rimmed eyes. Except for the loyal sidekicks it's hard to know which way some of these people are going to go but they're all vying for the audience's distracted attention.And then there is the further major distraction and overkill factor of the gadgetry, the weaponry almost everybody has in his hand, the Bat-suits the thuggish-heavy Batmobile--virtually indestructible, like some giant prehistoric beetle, and the Lamborghini, whose smashup was, for me, the film's saddest moment. What a beautiful thing! It cost hundreds of thousands to custom-make, and then they run other vehicles into it and put big dents in it. That's a blockbuster. It destroys all in its path. It burns up pyramids of money.Then also you've got sonar or radar or something in cell phones and tanks of gasoline, and dynamite and flame-thrower weaponry. Little things with blinky lights, a match, anything will do: The Joker likes to blow up things. And if you like to see explosions and fires and hospitals collapsing and cars and trucks flying through the air spectacularly (and pretty convincingly) this is your movie.If you like dialogue, it may not be. Voices get muffled in the noise and Christian Bale talks in a hoarse whisper as if he's trying to turn into Darth Vader but needs more amplification. Here again Heath Ledger stands out, and so does Maggie Gyllenhaal. They both speak their lines not only expressively but clearly and distinctly. Aaron Eckhardt gets to wear some pretty elaborate makeup. He, like Maggie, is a good addition to the series: she offers heaps of believable personality and his square jaw is made for a comic book hero. He could play Dick Tracy. He seems a long way now from Neil LaBute. And I'm sorry, 'The Dark Knight' lectures us an awful lot for a big budget action movie, about good and evil and law and order and stuff, but it's a long way from meaning anything--except that it's a terrible shame Heath Ledger had to die. He dives into and romps with this role. It's scary fun. He had much pleasure to give us. He was just beginning. The Joker rules.","

"The Dark Knight","barrygermansky-1","22 May 2009","Although suffering from a muddled plot, ill-defined characters, a typically uncharismatic performance by Christian Bale, and a lack of energy, The Dark Knight proved to be on of 2008's greatest commercial and critical successes.The fact that this film is in the Top Ten list tells me two things: 1) Most of the people who rated this highly are either 10-year-olds or adults with the attention span of 10-year-olds. I do not mean to offend all 10-year-olds, because there are some rare exceptions. But, you can catch my drift.2) People who rated this highly have not seen many of the other, better films on this list. They have nothing to compare The Dark Knight to.Anyway, I just hope this film's current standing sinks down far below the 250 mark.","

"The Dark Knight","laserdude","29 July 2008","The Dark Knight actually got lucky. Movies over the last six years have been crap. Scripts poorly written, over budgeted for the visual effect - yet not transferring well to the big screen, bad story ideas, copy cats of other films,lack of creativity, films that hold vulgarity and violence as a high standard of film making. That's what we've had over the years. Now comes Batman - Dark Knight. Which is written well enough but whose aim isn't good story telling. It's written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end. Why another Batman Joker movie? It's been done already.It has a mindless assembly-line quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the 2 1/2 hours of this film. The scenes are different only by location and a few faces. Something bad happens, the joker appears, Batman appears. Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears. Over and over and over again.The other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark. Like that's a good thing. I don't get it. Maybe because I've had too many real life experiences that were truly dark. Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining. Besides, movies over the last few years are all dark - even the light-hearted ones.This movie made me tired.","

"The Dark Knight","LaPfieffer92","19 November 2012","This is my big question as of late when reading the rave reviews for this super-overrated trash heap. When people start comparing this to REAL masterpieces like ""Lord of the Rings"", thats where i have to draw the line. i mean seriously what the hell is wrong with these people. thankfully I'm not alone in feeling this way. and its a shame because I've been a batman fan all my life, ever since i first saw the brilliant 1989 Batman with Keaton and nicholson, 2 of my favorite actors. the film was and is magical. it defined what a Comic Book movie should be. i saw and loved all of the subsequent sequels, except the 4th film, obviously. and yes i love Adam wests hilarious portrayal as well. but even that 4th camp entry with Ahnuld was more watchable then these new ones. yes, i will take my bat credit card (exp date: Forever) right to the bank before i will watch TDK again. now its sad because i cant say im a batman fan without having to explain to people why i cant stand the new movies. i constantly have to say ""oh i love the batman movies, the ORIGINAL movies, but not the new ones"". its gets tiring. on top of all this, the fans/nerds of these films have created almost a cult like following who seem to literally worship nolan and his *lack of* vision. hes no tim burton. he doesn't have the style OR substance. i saw Batman Begins and thought it was just OK, but disappointing. i saw TDK back when it first came out. i, like most everyone else, was bought by the hype. but after seeing it twice, i came to the conclusion that most fans will not agree with: THIS IS NOT A BATMAN FILM. call it a crime drama. call it a Heat remake, but please don't have the nerve to call it a batman film, because its just not. more then that, its completely humorless and with not even a hint of comedy, unless you count the really stupid cop lines ""i didn't sign up for this!"" JEEEZ. thats bad. actually it was the lines that were unintentionally bad like ""NO MO DEAD COPZ!"". *rolles eye*. But what gets me is those that review this movie that its a great comic book adaptation. couldn't be further from the truth. a superhero movie to be good, has to actually at least somewhat resemble the comics. nolan looks to completely set his movies apart from the other ones that he completely misses the point and the fun of batman. ""i will make my batman feel smart and intellectual"". however all he does is make very long, boring, drab, serious movies that never acknowledge the fact that its about a man dressed in a halloween costume. thats what upset me more then anything else. it doesn't even have the word ""batman"" in the title! i think the director was playing it safe to an extent in the first one, which did at times feel more like a batman film, whereas this one felt like little more then an elongated episode of ""law and order"". look, i know CSI is popular on TV these days, but it doesn't belong in a batman film. when i think of batman, i think, BIG action, COOL batmobile, wacky, colorful villains and big bombastic musical score. BIG. every things gotta be big. thats what you got with the original films. this movie however is like batman on a budget. i could get this same lame average car chases from an episode of 24. but in a batman movie, every things supposed to be a heightened reality and more fantastical and like a comic book. pure escapism. but no, not this version. this is what I've come to call the ""dull"" batman. nothing about nolan's vision excites me, from the modern-day urban-grit makeover, to the facile 24 style anti-terrorist plots, to the uninspired flatly staged action scenes. according to most bat fans, nolan's is the best comic-book adaptation of all time, yet I can find nothing in these movies that is fascinated by its comic book sources and the films simply read to me as an uninspired extension of the modern ""realistic gritty"" action movie although it suffers by comparison from a lack of earnestness or gleefulness. not only is the direction all wrong, but its got NO good action scenes. what little action there is, is completely dull. batman rides that fugly tank thing to chase joker. he goes to hong Kong. nice. then he uses everyones cell phones (more stupid cell phone propaganda) to locate joker and then proceeds to get the crap beat out of him BY joker. then he rescues him! HAHA. the movie is so stupid. joker never got the beating he wholly deserved. the message of the film is disgusting and depressing, if you can even figure it out amidst all the constant psychobabble thats thrown around. two face was a write-off, reduced to a cameo, a footnote for what is usually a very cool villain. tommy lee Jones may have been a bit hammy, but he was damn entertaining! this version, like the film itself, is instantly forgettable. why is it taking everyone so long to take off the emperors new clothes? this movie is abysmal and the fact so many people enjoy it so much says something gravely disturbing about society. i think people need to wake up, go to church, rekindle there soul and get away from this overly serious mumbo jumbo. why so serious is right, only i want to ask the director that. these movies only inspire death and killings. you never heard this happening with the original batman movies. now look. pretty scary. but im sure this will only inspire holly-weird to make even MORE of these dark depressing soulless hype machines that will only inspire more killings and so on and so on.","

"The Dark Knight","brando647","28 December 2008","Christopher Nolan has created the greatest superhero film ever in the latest installment of his Batman franchise. While I didn't get involved in all the viral marketing for this film, I did follow the news on it very closely in the year preceding it's release. I had some ridiculously high hopes for the movie before it came to theaters and I was so happy when it not only lived up to the hype, but blew it away. Not only is film the greatest superhero film to date, it is easily one of my favorite movies ever. The movie continues the Batman saga with the mob losing it's stranglehold on Gotham City due to the actions of Batman, Lieutenant Jim Gordon, and the new district attorney, Harvey Dent. In an act of desperation, the mob turns to a relative newcomer who offers to handle their little Batman problem...the Joker.Seeing as how Nolan wanted to keep his Batman franchise grounded in reality, I was confused as to how he planned to do so with a character such as the Joker. And, I won't lie, I was a bit leery upon hearing of his casting Heath Ledger in the iconic role. Well, I've learned my lesson and I will not doubt the skills of Christopher Nolan again. Ledger was AMAZING in his portrayal of the villain...he wasn't the least bit campy and he came off as a sadistic, chaotic, genuine threat to Batman. He stole EVERY scene he was in and was almost charismatic in his lunacy. It's a shame Ledger was so good in his performance because he nearly outshines the other great performances in the film.Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman each reprise their roles from the first film and continue providing solid performances. Oldman (Gordon) was given a larger role in this film and it was cool watching his character grow into the powerful figure we're familiar with. There have been a lot of complaints regarding Maggie Gyllenhaal's replacement of Katie Holmes in the role of Rachel Dawes but I thought she did a fine, if not a little better than Holmes. Finally, the film introduces Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, who I feel should get more recognition for his performance. While Ledger was definitely the highlight of the cast, Eckhart had the challenge of portraying Dent through a crucial character arc and pulled it off with ease.Everything about this film was a dramatic improvement over an already amazing film. The action was bigger, the tone was darker, the characters/cast were incredible...I really couldn't find a single thing to dislike about this film. The running time was a full 2.5 hours but you really don't notice. From the opening scene, the film grabs you and doesn't let up until the end. I know not everyone agrees with my opinion, but so everyone I've watched it with does. Nolan has created a Batman film that the audience doesn't need to be comic book fans to appreciate.","

"The Dark Knight","wtxx","10 March 2009","I am sincerely confused by all the hype around this movie. It just didn't seem that great to me. No characters had any personality or motivation whatsoever, except the Joker. There was no plot structure at all... the entire thing was just the Joker threatening to kill people and everybody freaking out, then repeat, then repeat again. No break in the action, no climax. And all this for at least two hours. By the end I was TRYING to fall asleep.Not to mention the really, really stupid plot devices. (If you don't care to hear my rant/list of these, which may include SPOILERS, skip to the next paragraph!) Being able to remotely transform all cellphones into high-resolution sonar devices? This idea is just stupid. Wayne chooses ""taking a boat ride with the entire Russian ballet"" as an alibi? Because somehow he trusts all these near-strangers enough not to blow his cover? That entire plot device was clearly an excuse to fit in at least one scene with scantily-clad women. And the Joker escapes from jail because they didn't bother to put his handcuffs back on after Batman took them off. How lame is that? As soon as he got into jail it was obvious he'd escape, because that's how these stereotypical plots always go, but I at least hoped it would be because of Joker's cleverness rather than because of a completely unrealistic and inexplicable lack of security. He was an infamously dangerous criminal, obviously an entire police station wouldn't be so lax around him. And when he holds his knife to an officer's neck to make demands, another officer about ten feet away is pointing a gun and has a clear shot at his head, and a reason to shoot, but he doesn't. Why not? This movie follows SO many other predictable plot stereotypes. Like the fact that as SOON as Harvey is disfigured, it's completely obvious that he is going to become a villain. Because you can't be disfigured without being evil... Only the handsomest of men are heroes. The most annoying thing is how they didn't even feel the need to explain his lighting-quick transition to being a supervillain with no convincing motivation except for showing his burns, because as soon as you saw that his face was burned you just knew he was evil, end of story. It's just like the way that as soon as you see a child in this movie, you KNOW that group of people won't die, because children never die, of course. The audience might be offended. Also, both protagonists are totally infatuated with some boring girl for no apparent reason, which is a pretty good sign that a movie isn't very thoughtful.Some of the ridiculousness and predictability of the movie's plot could have been forgiven if it wasn't so very tedious. Two hours of the exact same continuous action sequence with no breaks to allow for deeper plot or character development is just too much. Unless you like watching violence for its own sake regardless of plot, and have a really, really long attention span, I can't understand why you like this movie (and you probably do, everyone does, apparently). Not to mention that this long tedious action sequence mostly consists of the exact plot of the first half being reused as the second half (Joker's setup on the boat and the hospital were the same story, it's as if they couldn't decide which one to use and then thought ""hey, let's make this movie REALLY long and just use both of them, one right after the other..."").It did have some redeeming qualities. The joker WAS great, the nihilistic spin on his character was well-done. The beginning was relatively interesting, before they got into the repetitive action sequences. And toward the end they killed someone who I really didn't predict would die. But, I would never, EVER sit through this again.","

"The Dark Knight","michaelgrantham","14 August 2008","I shall probably get blown out of the water for this, but I hated the film. I absolutely loved Batman Begins, and thought it was the best of all the Batman films. But not this one.Maybe it didn't help that our local cinema had the volume up very high, so the action scenes and gunfire became irritating; however, the whole thing grated on me. I really can't understand how it got a 12 rating, as the violence, while often implied rather than actually shown was far too much for a 12 yr old. At least a 15 rating was called for in my view.I agree with with one of the other reviewers that there was no plot other than the constant battle between the Joker and Batman. Granted, Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was superb, and by far the best part of the film. He made a truly scary psycho! But that couldn't make up for the rest of the film.Maybe I need to watch it again on DVD (at a reasonable volume) but I was very disappointed as I had been looking forward to seeing it.So there it is. I'm obviously out of step with most of the viewing public!","

"The Dark Knight","xorys","23 November 2008","How could this movie possibly have received so much acclaim? OK, it's competently executed, both in terms of acting and production values - but then with the money spent on it, hopefully that should be taken for granted. And certainly it has some fine actors in it, and they give every impression of fully believing in their work. But what the heck is the point of it supposed to be? I'm sorry, but I just absolutely hated it. It reminds me of a local case in the press here in Toronto a while ago where some 'art student' made a movie of a cat being tortured to death. Since he actually tortured a cat to death to make it, he was charged and prosecuted, and his defence was that it was 'art'. Well... at least all the people tortured and killed in this movie presumably were only faking it and weren't actually hurt. But I still don't think it has any more claim to be worthwhile or to be art. It's obnoxious rubbish... and I strongly suggest that if you haven't seen it and are considering doing so, you think of some better use for your time (which would be pretty much anything not actually harmful to your health or anybody else's).","

"The Dark Knight","jai84@yahoo.com","18 July 2008","The sheer brilliance of this film cannot be described in words. The Nolan brothers have delivered one of the most riveting and powerful scripts in recent times with lot of technical panache'. This is a film that never lets go of its momentum right from the beginning and holds your attention till the most morally complex climax in a summer movie.Do not treat this film as a superhero or a vigilante story. It has lot more going for it. For instance one of the many ""Aces"" in the movie is the Joker - heath ledger. He owns every scene that he is in and it was good to see the rest of cast let him grab the center stage whenever he is on screen. The actor has set a tough benchmark with this role and he will be remembered for years to come.""The Dark Knight"" is as much a showcase of action set pieces as it is a classic story between good and evil and what happens when lines are crossed on both the sides to achieve their respective motives.Batman is a hero not because of the stunts that he performs or the fights he engages himself in but because the sacrifices he makes for the city he believes in. This is beautifully depicted in this movie and we feel for him when the movie reaches its pinnacle.There are lots of positives one can see within this 2 hour plus epic.In simple words. It is a 10 on 10 and must see.","

"The Dark Knight","r3i6nm8n2002","25 August 2008","Normally I would give this a 7.5 out of 10 but since I cant' I'll give it a seven. How anyone could rate this title that high on IMDb.com is amazing to me. It's mostly fanboys that believe this is the best movie ever and the best thing since sliced bread but what most fanboys fail to notice because they lack objectivity is that while the movie is a good one, it is quite flawed and nowhere near as perfect as many of the fanboys have rated.A couple things I noticed when I watch this movie, the movie goes on way too long. Even my friends agreed and they are huge Batman fans. There are about 3 or 4 points in the movie where it seems like it will end but goes on for another 30 minutes. And while Heath Ledger's performance is top notch and Bale as Bruce Wayne is pulled of quite flawlessly, his Batman persona is a bit weak. The voice is annoying, and many times throughout the movie, he seemingly plays second fiddle.I can't know Eckhart's casting as Two Face but Maggie Gyllenhall just doesn't seem to fit and just seems to be a standalone piece of eye candy.There are many things I can harp about but I'm not here to knock the movie. There are good points, cinematography great, Joker and Two Face played excellently by their counterparts, mood was effective and story flowed quite well albeit a bit too long.BUT this movie doesn't even belong in mention to some of the greats and shame on many movie fans that had this movie rated higher than such classics as The Godfather. Obviously the fanboys bought way too much into the hype.","

"The Dark Knight","thebengalimafia-1","17 August 2008","Comic book movies as we know them are over. Gone are the special effects laden cartoons like ""The Incredible Hulk"" and ""Fantastic Four."" Consider this the ""official"" death of a movie like ""Superman Returns"" which was beyond terrible. ""The Dark Knight"" redefines the comic book movie and changes all the possibilities of where superheroes go and what they're capable of.There should be no doubt that the driving force in this film is the ever maniacal Joker. I wouldn't doubt the fact that he's probably going to go down as the greatest comic film villain of all time after being portrayed so brilliantly and effortlessly by the late Heath Ledger. The Joker never fails to deliver the most diabolical and sinister games that force all the film's heroes to have to make sometimes painful choices. In his own words, ""I'm an agent of chaos."" Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) realizes that to stop the Joker he has to become something he swore never to be. This results in an interesting turn of events that really can't be put into words, but I will tell you it involves a chase scene.The film really crosses the line in terms of the traditional comic book film in it's exploration of human nature and raises implications on social, political, and moral levels. The last time I saw a movie with that many themes was the multiple Academy Award winning ""Children of Men."" Personally, I've always felt films that use fiction to explore the current reality we live in or the ramifications of our decisions usually give us a cold, harsh, reality check. Christopher Nolan's screenplay and choice of dialog is more complex than any comic film, not to mention considerably more poetic. Gotham City let Batman operate without having to answer to the law. What happens when you give one man all the power? Gotham City District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) explains, ""When their enemies were at the gates, the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It wasn't considered an honor, it was considered a service."" His girlfriend, who also happens to be Bruce's ex-girlfriend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), shoots back, ""Harvey! The last man to protect the Republic was named Caesar!"" A lot of these implications wouldn't be relevant if we weren't living in post 9/11 America, so I recommend you read up on something called Executive Unitary Theory to get the full effect of giving one man all the power.Apart of what made this film so hard hitting was the stellar performances. None of them were actors this time, they were actors who completely lost themselves in the characters they built, every one of which we come to care about. Lieutenant Jim Gordon's (Gary Oldman) promotion to Police Commissioner is well deserved. The movie also allows Oldman to take Gordon to new heights and really shows how Batman and Gordon are in this together, and Gordon as a character really comes of age.""The Dark Knight,"" in the end, wasn't merely about good and evil. It was about the fight for Gotham, and showing the city's people that you could overcome evil with good. Early on someone mentions that Harvey Dent is Gotham City's ""White Knight."" Dent is a handsome, well educated, elected official. The people paint the picture of him as this incorruptible force of good. Batman on the other hand, is a vigilante; a man who exists outside the law. People end up having more faith in Dent than Batman, but Dent fails. It's because Batman is there to take the fall that Dent, as a symbol, continues to thrive. People had faith in Harvey Dent and he fails. As Batman puts it, ""People deserve to have their faith rewarded, even if it means we have to hide the truth I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be."" This is what makes him the real hero, as Gordon puts it, ""He's Gotham's protector; our Dark Knight."" This is one of the year's best films. Go see it now!","

"The Dark Knight","aussiefilmlover","25 August 2008","Even for a blockbuster cotton candy movie, this is a piece of crap. Got a script that makes so sense, characters that you don't care about and mindless violence and unbelievable set pieces.How do you know the joker is a guy that just likes to see things burn? why first Alfred tells us that and if you didn't get it the first time, the joker then tells us he just likes to see things burn and sure enough if that was too subtle for you, he then sets things on fire! Then there is the fact that keep on calling him a terrorist when he goes on about how he only care about chaos. First of all a terrorist is a person who acts because they do have a strong belief not because they have no beliefs. Terrorist do the things they do with a goal in mind, they are in fact the total opposite of the Joker character.Then you have a film that's basic message is hey sometimes it's OK to lie and pretend someone is a hero when they aren't. Wow what a wonderful things to support, I'm sure George W. bush loved this film.Then there is the acting. how hard is it to play completely crazy, not that damn hard, just because Health Ledger is dead, doesn't mean his acting is suddenly good.

"The Dark Knight","impendingdd","2 March 2020","Some things I will never understand. Women, why we exist on earth, and the massive praise this film has received since its release in 2008. The Dark Knight is truly overrated. For starters, Bale's Batman voice is laughable and distracting. It's horrendous. The score of this film is so tedious it feels like one giant trailer, it fails to recognize suspense. The film itself is a wannabe gangster film and it's very boring. I will give it to Nolan though, he may very well be a genius. He made a comic book film as close to real life as possible, which I theorize caused so many people to praise the film itself to be genius. It was something very different. But that's not enough to make a movie ""the best movie of all time"", as I've heard it being referred to. I've tried countless times to give this movie a chance. Over and over struggling to find out why it's held so high. I cannot say that I simply dismissed it, I've actually tried. And yes, I'm fully aware of Heath Ledger's performance and that it was a key element of this film's praise and success. And yes Ledger was terrific, that's apparent. His annoying tongue tick aside and tiring faux ""you wanna know how I got these scars"" stories, he became the Joker. But that just wasn't enough for me, the film isn't a masterpiece, not even close. It's almost as bad as your typical action film. You know what, who is anyone kidding, this is a typical action movie with Batman. I don't care about the characters, there's too many distractions. I am still in search for someone who will agree with me, as it seems that everyone holds this film to a high standard.","

Joker is absolutely iconic and has some good jokes, but you can't help but feel that he is a true threat. With the previous movie in the trilogy, the villain had certain goals to cleanse society; they weren't completely immoral. Heath Ledger's Joker stops at nothing. His goal is to make chaos, and as a great butler once said, ""Some people just want to watch the world burn"", which is perfect description for this character, testing to see how even merely mentions of his future actions can drive the world into a craze.","

"The Dark Knight","vip_ebriega","1 August 2008","My Take: A bold, visionary modern classic.No joke here! THE DARK KNIGHT, the new Batman thriller from Christopher Nolan, has a lot of buzz that comes along the merchandise and the marketing, but it avoids all the shortcomings, and even in fact going beyond audience expectations. After Nolan's own brooding and realistic version BATMAN BEGINS, audience expected a similar approach on DARK KNIGHT. The arrogant Bruce Wayne, the darker vigilante Batman, no nipples on the Batsuit, all that is fulfilled in this new film, but this is also darker and much better than anyone in the audience expected it to be. In fact, it's the darkest, deepest and most significant and exciting one in the series since BATMAN RETURNS. While it takes a different path from the original series (although thankfully, staying much away from the awful BATMAN & ROBIN), this is the new Batman for the new ages.Christian Bale reprises his role as the most arrogant (and best) Bruce Wayne, and alter ego Batman, who once again sets out to restore order in the crime-ridden streets of Gotham City (not exactly the land of opportunity), as it is once again leaking with criminality and injustice, in the form of the evil Joker (the late Heath Ledger, who makes a brilliant performance in his last film that made the evening news) and crime lords who terrorize and make their own circus of chaos. It's up to the Bat to put a stop to it all, but this time, it ain't juts gonna be his job. District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is the hero without a mask who lends his own hands to keep Gotham in high stands against crime, despite the every growing urban chaos. Dent also happens to be dating Bruce Wayne's best friend Rachael Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Mrs. Cruise Katie Holmes), blooming up a little love triangle that doesn't go corny at all.Nolan's Batman worlds are fantastic and effective ones. Whilst not the visually eye-popping Blade Runner-era Gotham City that Tim Burton's BATMAN RETURNS was, but surely much closer to the reality of current situations. This time, the threats are real, and the solutions to the problems are far more desperate than kicking ass. Crime is real, crime is bad, and Nolan emphasizes on every frame. The absolute reality of the picture is one of the reasons why it's the best and most topical Bat-film to date. But DARK KNIGHT is a mere subject discussion. The excitement comes in waves, from chases down the dark streets with trucks, vans, and the Bat's own Batmobile (which transforms into a speeding motor-bike when it self-destructs), or battle sequences that are intense as they are well-made, DARK KNIGHT satisfies as pure entertainment. The screenplay is bold and daring, venturing into a subject so much deeper than where it usually settles upon (enough to make you forget the fiasco BATMAN & ROBIN was). Then there are the performances, mentioning the late Mr. Ledger's performance front and center, are excellent and nearly flawless. To date, it may be the best performed superhero flick I've ever seen.All-in-all, THE DARK KNIGHT is the superhero mainstream of the summer you have got to see if you see no other (and I may doubt that you'll see more). No joke! Rating: ***** out of 5.","

"The Dark Knight","bekisil","14 February 2024","""The Dark Knight"", directed by Christopher Nolan, is a cinematic tour de force that transcends typical superhero movie expectations and delivers a compelling narrative about morality, chaos, and heroism.Christian Bale's portrayal of Batman/Bruce Wayne is nuanced and complex, effectively capturing the internal struggle of a man burdened by his dual identity. However, it's Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance as the Joker that truly steals the show. Ledger's Joker is chaotic and unpredictable, a villain who challenges Batman's moral code in ways that are both disturbing and thought-provoking.The film's plot is intricate and layered, with a script that balances action-packed sequences with quieter, character-driven moments. The cinematography is stunning, and the score by Hans Zimmer adds to the overall intensity and suspense.""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a superhero movie - it's a reflection on the nature of heroism and the thin line that separates order from chaos.

"The Dark Knight","jax713","13 December 2008","This is one of those films teenagers can see and then feel like they've seen a meaningful movie with great action scenes and grown-up themes, a movie that seems to present deep moral philosophies and it has the additional benefit of a cast that has real acting credentials. All in all, I suspect teens will rave about this movie as one of the best of all time.In reality, TDK shows what Christopher Nolan can - and can't - do with a big budget. He wallows in his own zeitgeist, stuck in the quicksand of his creativity and unable to hone & polish a slush fund of ideas and concepts about explosions, car chases, the rantings of a killer called The Joker, and the fortitude of a hero called Batman. The movie drags on and on and on looking for its core, but never finds it. Ultimately, all it finds are the excuses it needs for the special effects.Heath Ledger's performance is outstanding, but then his character is the only one in the film that has much of anything to say and, since he's a caricature, he can ham it up to his heart's desire. Character development is not high on the priority list. The supposed romance between plain-faced boring Rachel and Batman is like a red herring, serving what purpose I could not see. But then, plot development isn't a high priority for this story, either. There is a weak attempt to bring a mob crime boss into the plot as an accomplice to The Joker, and an even weaker sub-plot about moving money to Asia, but all of this is treated so superficially you can see how Nolan just doesn't have the artist's discipline to edit out unnecessary footage. He thinks *everything* he writes and films is important, forgetting that the mature audience is not looking for a ride on his ego trip.TDK has the look of a storyboard or perhaps a comic: blocks of scenes, dialogue, and graphics. It lacks the fluidity of true drama that is paced with suspense and emotional connections between characters. It lacks the wit that is absolutely necessary to make a fantasy entertaining and involving. It is overwrought, overlong, and bloated by its self-importance. But because it's Batman on a big budget and has little competition and critics are starved for something to praise, it will sell.",NA
"The Dark Knight","lagriff05","23 August 2008","Well, it's here, the movie of the summer and likely the movie of the year, too. Everyone had high hopes for The Dark Knight, and they were raised as new trailers were released and even moreso after Heath Ledger, our new Clown Prince of Crime, died, and the movie itself surpassed all of them.For one, let's talk about the movie as a whole. It's clear that Nolan and the main actors have all read their comics - Ledger apparently loves The Killing Joke - and done their homework, as on the prequel to this one, Batman Begins. What I love most about this is that it doesn't stray from the comics just to make the movie more watchable on screen, but rather to make the series fresh and innovative. Nolan takes the fabric of the Batman story and contorts it into something that it very well could have been if started in 2008 instead of 1940. Never does it feel forced or cheap, just...an alternative. A well made alternative at that.This is definitely a success as a comic book movie, but we also have an added dose of hyperactive, metal-spiked flaming tank ownage via Die Hard 3, vamping the levels of ass-kicking up about ten notches. Seriously, this just rules all the way through, with a polished sheen and a ton of edgy, super-memorable scenes that will keep you coming back again and again. There's a lot going on here, about three different subplots, and I definitely didn't catch everything on one viewing. But the speed is just another reason this is good, rather than a detractor, as in the first film. Everything is done a step up better than on the film's prequel, and that is how any sequel should be, but usually isn't.The acting is the other high point. I felt that the acting in Batman Begins was sometimes inadequate, but that has been fixed here. This is more relaxed, calculated and well performed, with sterling performances by Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart (honorable mentions for his excellent Two Face, nobody could have done it better!) and especially Heath Ledger. Ledger's Joker is indeed of the Killing Joke school, except he's even more dark and devious than he was in that novel. Every moment he's on screen he captivates, being the perfect counterbalance to Batman's rigid, often frightening justice stance. The ""disappearing pencil"" trick, the ""Why so serious?"" scene, and his final moments, laughing in the wind of the night...all masterful, completely superlative. Every inch of the praise upon him is worthy. Believe it.So basically this rules, see it instead of whatever other movie you were planning on seeing in 2008. The bar has been set high for a third installment to this series, and even if there isn't one, well, it's always better to go out on a high note. And that's what The Dark Knight is; a high note. My highest recommendation.",NA
"The Dark Knight","Travixius","12 March 2009","The Dark Knight is the worst sequel since ""Highlander 2: The Quickening"". I am dumbfounded at this entry into the franchise that was re-invigorated so wonderfully with Batman Begins. I speak to people frequently about this film and have had little opposition to my views on it, ergo people don't like it. I really think this film is the biggest dupe since The Blair Witch Project. I want to make it clear that I love Batman, Bob Kane's Batman, Frank Miller's Batman, Jeph Loeb's Batman and the DC Animated Universe's Batman. Like many, I found the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher films excruciating to watch. Batman Begins came along and Christopher Nolan gave us a Batman we could respect and understand as well as believe. We were then teased with The Joker's calling card and ready for what was going to be the meeting of the the most famous adversaries in comic and screen history....and we got....a joker with self applied makeup and no gadgets who is essentially a terrorist, no batcave, a batsuit that looked like a riot cop, a convoluted Scorsese like story about laundered money and a massive emphasis on factionalised and organised crime, a Two-Face who's only motive is a dead girlfriend, a Batman we hardly see, and a Gotham City that now looks like Chicago. But the enigma I can't stomach is that the film HAD NO CLIMAX!!! I asked many viewers what they thought the climax was and there is a different answer each time...oh it was Batman confronting Dent...no it was the Joker hanging upside down, no it was Rachel Dawes being killed.....NO there was no climax! This film's success lies only in the sad fact that it's main antagonist was played by an actor who died during the promotional phase of the film. In Nolan's attempt to legitimise the Batman mythos he has made it sterile and boring.",NA
"The Dark Knight","SealedCargo","29 July 2008","This was one of the worst movies ever made. Never before have I witnessed a more confusing and convoluted mess. There were about ten subplots, but there was no main plot. The Joker existed to run amok and to represent the ""honest villain"", that is, he didn't mess around and play games like most villains, and he didn't do it for money, he just killed and wreaked havoc for the heck of it... okay, that's fine. But in having the Joker purposely ruin all the other subplots involving other bad guys, it basically made all the energy in having to keep up with the subplots involving these other people come to nothing. It was very tiresome realizing that everything you witnessed, after two hours of non-story action and hammy performances, really didn't mean a thing, kind of like when a movie shows that ""it's all a dream"". It might as well have been a dream. Because in this complete mess of a film, nothing mattered. The Joker had no purpose - which was intentional. But since the rest of the movie had too much purpose, or rather, tried too hard to have all the purpose in the world - it all came together like a big explosion... then, nothing. Just ruins. And two and a half hours of my life wasted. As for Heath Ledger, he wasn't terrific. He wasn't amazing. He was horrible. Weak. Sounded like a nerd. And he claims to have studied from ""A Clockwork Orange"" (please!), but he seemed more like he was doing a Johnny Depp impression, being silly and androgynous. It's just such a mess of a film. Horrible, simply horrible. And the reason I haven't mentioned Batman himself, is that he was so nothing, that there isn't anything to say about him. The main character seems more like a Vin Diseal character, and not a comic book hero. I understand trying to make the franchise more serious after being ruined by Joel Schumaker, but this film doesn't resemble a comic book in any way at all. It could have been a cop film, only the main cop had pointy ears, and the main villain had really bad makeup.",NA
"The Dark Knight","zardoz-13","29 July 2008","""Batman Begins"" writer & director Christopher Nolan's new Caped Crusader saga ""The Dark Knight"" qualifies as too much of a good thing. In other words, the movie boasts greater ambitions than its lengthy 152 minutes can accommodate. Mind you, ""The Dark Knight"" is every bit as good as ""Batman Begins."" The chief difference is that this Batman sequel flaunts bigger and better production values as well as loftier aims.Not only does ""The Dark Knight"" align our hero with Bob Kane's original vigilante creation, but it also reinvents the Batman's nefarious nemesis, the Harlequin of Hatethe Joker. The Joker drives Batman over the edge! He ranks as an unforgettable villain. While Nolan and his brother Jonathan remain faithful to the spirit of Kane's Batman, this sequel indulges in derring-do more outlandish and audacious than its predecessor and depicts the showdown between Batman and the Joke as a duel of titans.During its initial two hours, this white-knuckled, larger-than-life, adventure epic keeps you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately, it sacrifices that momentum in the last 30 minutes with a convoluted subplot that turns into a predictable and pretentious mediation on good citizenship. Although Batman has been around since 1939, the Nolan brothers deserve kudos for taking this unique American crime fighter to the next level. Furthermore, amid all the adrenaline-laced activities and high octane explosions, the Nolans have concocted a crackerjack near-classic with more on its mind that hair-raising heroics.""The Dark Knight"" opens with an imaginative bank robbery. Gun-toting, clown-faced robbers kill each other as each completes their phase of the crime. The hold-up and the getaway are nimbly staged, except there's an inherent flaw. If you think about it, how can the Joker recruit high-class henchmen if he has them knock each other off? Nevertheless, we learn quickly that the Joker is the ultimate anarchist. He refuses to play by the rules, and the Nolans generate a lot of melodrama about Batman's vigilante efforts to apprehend him. ""Hancock"" beat ""The Dark Knight"" to the punch about the price of vigilantism. Not only do the authorities want to catch the Joker, but they also wouldn't mind nabbing the Batman.Incorruptible Lieutenant Jim Gordon (a mustached and bespectacled Gary Oldman of ""True Romance"") is the only cop that Batman trusts. Naturally, Gordon is reluctant to let crusading Gotham City District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart of ""No Reservations"") into the loop. Although the mobsters have been piling up loot, laundering it, and then hiding it in Gotham's banks with a Chinese gangster Lau (Chin Han of ""3 Needles"") protecting their earnings, Batman and Lt. Gordon devise a clever way to identify mob money. Inevitably, the Asian mastermind skips Gotham for the sanctuary of China where he expects to escape extradition. Batman shocks Lau with a surprise visit. The Caped Crusader's excursion beyond Gotham City constitutes a first for the film franchise. Batman's abduction of the Asian crime lord resembles similar abductions from the John Wayne Vietnam war movie ""The Green Beret"" and the Timothy Dalton 007 caper ""License to Kill."" No sooner have the authorities jailed Lau than the Joker approaches Gotham City's criminal cartel with a new plan. The Joker's first scene where he makes a pencil disappear is hilarious. Meanwhile, since Wayne Manor melted down in ""Batman Begins,"" our hero has had to relocate to make-shift quarters. Bruce Wayne realizes that Batman is something bigger than he had imagined, including the copycat Batmen prowling the city. Being the Batman, as ""The Dark Knight"" shows, is no picnic. Our hero has acquired his share of bruises, wounds, and dog bites, and he has his top man at Wayne Enterprises, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman of ""Unforgiven""), developing a dog-proof Bat suit. Despite his crime busting exploits, Bruce yearns for the day that he can drop the masquerade and wed childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes. The nihilistic Joker doesn't give him much breathing room in this installment.Warner Brothers, DC Comics and the Nolan brothers will have to manufacture a miracle to top this slam-bang, gravity-defying actioneer. Christian Bale surpasses Michael Keaton, George Clooney, and Val Kilmer as Batman. Bale's Batman is more realistic, more sympathetic, and the Welsh star's lean wolfish looks make him look treacherous. In short, Bale is the best Batman since Adam West! The late Heath Ledger really gets under the clown make-up as the Joker. Aaron Eckhart's vigorous performance as Harvey Dent is no less sterling. Alas, the Nolans give Dent the short shrift when they shoehorn his dramatic makeover carelessly in the final half-hour. Leggy Maggie Gyllenhaal isn't much of an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Composers Hans Zimmer and John Newton Howard provide a powerful, atmospheric orchestral score that sets the mood and accentuates the cliffhanger heroics. At the same time, Christopher Nolan wastes no time getting the action in gear. Nolan maintains momentum and suspense while scattering surprises throughout the mayhem. Only during the last 30 minutes does the story begin to unravel. No, ""The Dark Knight"" isn't the masterpiece that ""Iron Man"" was, but this latest entry in the Batman franchise proves you can have your Cape and eat it, too!",NA
"The Dark Knight","griffolyon12","18 July 2008","The Dark Knight is the follow-up to 2005's Batman Begins. Now I thought Batman Begins was amazing, I mean it is one of my favorite films of all-time. To sum it up, I was very pumped about the sequel, but there was always that fear in the back of my mind that The Dark Knight might not be as good as Batman Begins, but finally after three years of waiting I can say that The Dark Knight is not just as good as Begins, but it in fact blows it out of the water. The story of The Dark Knight follows Batman on his continuing crusade to rid Gotham City of crime. In this film Batman begins to see hope for both him and Gotham in the hopes of the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent. Batman feels that Gotham needs a hero with a face, and he believes that Dent is that hero, not Batman. Of course, Batman's hopes are soon shattered by the arrival of a new criminal mastermind calling himself the Joker.As I have already said, The Dark Knight is amazing, you could call it a masterpiece, but that just doesn't seem to fully sum up how blown away I was by this film. To start, the directing by Christopher Nolan is superb, reinforcing once more that he is quite possibly the film industries greatest current filmmaker. On top of that the cinematography by Wally Pfister is amazing, and I really think it is about time he finally wins an Oscar for his work. Then the score by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer is perfect, fitting each scene perfectly. Finally the script by Jonathan and Christopher Nolan is perfect, flowing perfectly from scene to scene, making this 2 and a 1/2 hour film feel as if it lasted only 90 minutes, but in a good way. Of course the true highlight of the film is the acting from the all-star cast, all actors turn in perfect performances, including: Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart as D.A. Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, Michael Caine as Alfred the Butler, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Maggie Gyllennhaal replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes; though the one performance that truly stands out ahead of the others is the late Heath Ledger as the Joker, he was amazing, this role just fit him like a glove, and he truly deserves a post-humous Oscar win.In final thought, the Dark Knight is epic, emotional, and exciting, all at the same time. I loved this film, it was tense and disturbing while being at times a little comical through the Joker's odd, dark sense of humor. I could go on all day long talking about how perfect this film was, but I'll try to wrap things up here. The Dark Knight is easily the best film of 2008, and should definitely be considered for some big-time Oscars, in particular Heath Ledger's stunning performance as the Joker; but not only is The Dark Knight the year's best film, it is the best film of the decade thus far. The Dark Knight is the Greatest Comic Book Film of All-Time, and definitely stands in my books as one of the Greatest Films of All-Time. It is a true masterpiece.The Dark Knight earns a perfect 10 out of 10!",NA
"The Dark Knight","tavm","21 July 2008","Before I comment on the movie proper, I'd like to mention two things: One, the person I went with-who works at this particular theatre and saw the midnight premiere-thought the bank manager role was played by Jimmy Smits but I immediately recognized him as William Fichtner from ""Invasion"", the TV series he did with Eddie Cibrian. Also, when the Joker was threatening Rachel Dawes, it was the only time I was taken out of the picture since I said aloud that he was threatening Jake Gyllenhaal's sister with my friend mentioning her name since we both saw Heath Ledger and Jake in Brokeback Moutain a few years ago. Ledger is fine as the main villain though I stop at saying he's better than Jack Nicholson in the role or deserves an Oscar nomination though it would be fine if he did. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement from Katie Holmes as Bruce Wayne's former girlfriend though I remember liking Holmes fine too. And Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, Dawes' new beau, is also fine with his initial role as ""white knight"" district attorney later turning into what would become known as Two-Face. And I loved having Michael Caine as Alfred the Butler having a previous background in the battling jungles of Burma so he can tell his master of his dilemma there. Throw in Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox and you've almost got a perfect movie. Certainly, Christian Bale as the Caped Crusader is even better here than in Batman Begins and he is to me, like many viewers, The absolute Dark Knight here. While the movie may be longish in spots, Christopher Nolan lets it be that way so he can make us really care for the characters. I certainly was very touched by the sacrifices the new Commissoner Gordon, as played by Gary Oldman, had to make throughout the picture especially when he had to deal with Two-Face and his family's peril near the end. So the many who went to see this once and want to do it again, what are you waiting for? P.S. Having not recognized Anthony Micheal Hall previously, I'll have to look for him the next time I watch which may be soon too!",NA
"The Dark Knight","tomimt","4 August 2008","A daring bank heist kicks open the second Batman film directed by Christopher Nolan. Continuing on the path provided in the Batman Begins, The Dark Knight balances itself between reality and comic book fantasy. The action certainly is from the comics in the way of realism, but the style is nothing but gritty realism, but even that it seems to do in steroids, which is not a bad thing.As some other reviewers have stated, this movie is not about the Batman (Christian Bale), but the Joker (Heath Ledger), who is not given a similar birth story like he was in Tim Burton's Batman film, but who just enters the room, so to speak, and is utterly insane and fascinating in his own deadly way. In fact I was mesmerized how little Ledger resembled anything I'd seen him before this. I wasn't looking at an actor, I was looking at the Joker, ripped from the pages of the comic books and thrown on the screen in his full insanity intact.The second criminal in the tale is Twoface, aka Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who's a district attorney of Gotham city, who has a transformation of his own in the tale, all thanks to Joker's twisted little games.The Dark Knight is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. The story twists and turns in every way, but it manages to keep in tact better than some films with simpler lines. Well chosen actors mixed with good score, well woven plot, stunning cinematography and breath taking action makes The Dark Knight one of the best films to come out in ages.",NA
"The Dark Knight","NightmareOnElmStreetFan","28 September 2019","The Dark Knight is the best Batman superhero movie an artistic piece of modern superhero cinema masterpiece. I love Batman: Begins to death, both of the films directed by Christopher Nolan I love The dark Knight to death and it is my third favorite Batman movie. I appreciate Batman Begins and The Dark Knight equally. Heath Ledger is the best Joker of all time, he really bring it to an all time high! R.I.P. Heath Ledger he is really missed by fans. Heath Ledger's performance was the best of this movie. Right after this film the actor past away. Heath Ledger is the best Joker ever!! The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are the best movies made by comic books. Heath Ledger for me personally is the only Joker to me not Joaquin Phoenix or Jack Nischolson. I will always take The Dark Knight over Joker new movie.""I'M NOT WEARING HOCKEY PADS!""To me the problem is I don't like the costum for Batman in this movie. I enjoyed Batman's costum in Batman Begins more in this one I don't felt he looks like Batman. I don't like blue colors on the end of the film. We don't see Wayne's Mansion in this film. I don't like killing Rachel Dawes in this movie. Maggie Gyllenhaal sister of Jake Gyllenhaal was good but she could come near Katie Holmes. I don't appreciate that suddenly Rachel dates Harvey and she choose Harey over Bruce, I don't like that. The film is 2 hrs and 32 mins long which is too long. I barely make it, it was slow paced, the film moved slow too me. Maggie Gyllenhaal was hot sexy, beautiful babe i would have sex with her imidietly but as an actress she just couldn't hold a candle to Katie Holmes. Michael Jai White is in this movie but he gets killed so esaly. I don't like Gordon demolishing and destroying Batsignal. I don't like the finale that Batman becomes now a wanted fugitive I hated that. Why he had to take the fall for Harvey Dent's crimes, it makes no sense. Those things i don't like in this film.I love The Dark Knight but it didn't got an impact on me like Batman Begins did. I know The Dark Knight is better than Batman Begins but I prefer the first movie over this one. The Dark Knight is a masterpiece but in my opinion it is way too overrated. The action scenes are great filmed and Christan Bale's performance was alright. Joker was a bad-ass I love his character because he is nobody without his name. We found out that he used to be married but his wife left him and his father gave him a scars. I stil like the action sequences. In the opening scene Batman catches his imposters and Dr. Crane. I love the dialogue "" I'm not wearing hockey pads"". I like Batman kicking ass in Maroni's club and he throws Maroni on the sidewalk. I love Batman with Batpod he races trough the mall I love the Batpod in this movie. The movie was filmed in IMAX I love that if you watch the film on Blu-ray disc you can see IMAX version. DVD has standard Picture quality it dosen't show IMAX version. I wish I would have for Captain America: Civil War (2016) IMAX version on Blu-ray disc sadly I don't have that.Overall I love it, it is the best Batman movie, Heath Ledger is the reason why this movie is a masterpiece. But it is way to overrated and the slow paced film. It dosen't quickly around as I thought. It is my third favorite Batman film, but of the trilogy the first 2 Batman movies in TDK trilogy are great Rises is the weakest one of the three. I love The Dark Knight - Heath Ledger to me is the best Joker not Joaquin Phoenix.",NA
"The Dark Knight","jwjwpnvq","18 July 2021","I can watch this movie an infinite number of times. It never gets old. From the perfect action scenes, epic score and iconic performances, this movie has it all. I think the performances in this movie are so underrated. Ledger's performance as joker is one of the best in cinema history. Not to mention Bale's perfect batman, Oldman's Gordon, and Caine's Alfred. I could write pages about the perfection of each scene in this movie. Every time I watch it it is like the first time, and I can not think of a better compliment.",NA
"The Dark Knight","blanbrn","20 July 2008","""The Dark Knight"" which is the sequel to Christopher Nolan's 2005 ""Batman Begins"" clearly without question is a much better film as it goes deeper into the dark mind of both the superhero(""Batman"") and the villain(""The Joker""). The action and drama in the film is nonstop and you as the viewer will find it interesting and exciting. Yet most of all as I just mentioned unlike many comic book films of the past which have been kids stuff this is a film that shows the darkness of human nature proving that good and evil are just a short distance away from one another.When you have such great talent on a set like Bale, Ledger, Eckhart, Caine, Oldman, and Gyllenhaal with the serious psychological direction you clearly know that a film of this type is out to prove that it's fun and full of character struggles with all of it boiling to epic showdowns. Nolan makes the film very lengthy to try and wrap it all together, yet as bat fans know no matter how much you try to get across this saga will always be an epic that continues really my only negative of the film was the long length. As for everything else I loved the way that Nolan explored the conflict and dark minds of both ""Batman"" and the ""Joker"". Plus his subplot that involved the ""Harvey Dent"" character and for his new approach of how the creation of ""Two-Face"" became was interesting and neat.You find Gotham the same only this time ""The Joker""(Heath Ledger)is robbing banks in the city, yet his main plan is to overthrow and control all of the city's underworld workings. Here we find ""The Joker"" shown in a much different form than in the past. This is an evil villain with smeared makeup who was deeply hurt by his father and it was different seeing the clown prince having a weapons choice of a knife. Ledger takes the character to new psychotic heights in fact this performance from him rivals more like a turn to the ""Alex"" character in a ""Clockwork Orange"". I still favor the 1989 performance from legendary great Jack Nicholson who took the ""Joker"" role over the top with a mixture of camp and humor that still lead to majestic vanity, yet still this crazy freak turn from Ledger was great work for the way he did it with such maniacal grace. Heath certainly saved his best performance for last.Bale is once again in top form as ""Batman"" who yet again is a conflicted man trying to clean up Gotham even though an element of camp is shown in the film when it shows the city is running with copycat ""Batmans"". The love interest is still Rachel Dawes(Maggie Gyllenhaal who's a big upgrade over Katie Holmes)only the moonlight shift has caused a break in the romance so Harvey Dent(Aaron Eckhart)moves in to steal both types of thunder first the romancing of Rachel then he's out to shine as the city's crime fighting DA. Underneath all the conflict and drama the best man to see thru the corruption in the complex world is Lt. James Gordon(Gary Oldman). During all the drama and action and corruption the subplot and twist of Dent becoming ""Two-Face"" happens quickly which wasn't really necessary as this film's central theme is a hero who has to battle with darkness in his own mind and heart.So overall what more can I say on many levels this is the best ""Batman"" movie ever made. As Nolan clearly accomplished a lot with his direction of showing how even a hero can be very conflicted and complicated yet still must fight the darkness and be the heart that shines for justice and protection against evil and corruption. Sadly it's a shame that Ledger didn't live to see this work of success in which he as a dark wild card character helped blaze the film to a glorious victory. Heath's performance is one of the best in film history, and ""The Dark Knight"" in my opinion is one of the greatest films ever made.",NA
