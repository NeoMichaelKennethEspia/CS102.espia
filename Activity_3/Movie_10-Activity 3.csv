"Alien","Sleepin_Dragon","16 January 2020","Alien remains one of the most original, terrifying movies of all time. Compare this with the lame sci fi horrors we get nowadays, 1979, and it still packs a huge punch.Fantastically atmospheric, chilling and terrifying even now, the story holds up incredibly well. The special effects were incredible for the time, no wonder the franchise is still in demand, though sadly nowhere near the quality of this one or its amazing successor.The music is fantastic, the direction is incredible, and as for the Alien itself, way ahead of its time. Weaver is phenomenal, but arguably she's upstaged by the creature.You can't help but remember scenes days after watching it, it definitely has the chill factor.A cinematic masterpiece. 10/10","

"Alien","gogoschka-1","11 February 2018","'Alien' is one of those special films that have aged very, very well. Even now, after nearly 40 years, everything about it just feels fresh. The restrained, natural performances by the fantastic cast; the outstanding production design; the beautiful, ominous score by Jerry Goldsmith; the realistic, ""lived-in"" look of space-freighter Nostromo's interior: it actually feels less dated than many science fiction films that were made much later, which is quite an astonishing feat. Even the (what now must be considered) ""retro"" technology inside the ship doesn't necessarily have to be viewed as anachronistic in the face of our obvious recent advancements, because it's the most simple technological equipment that is usually robust enough to survive the longest under harsh conditions (like the extreme temperatures in space). I feel it's especially hard for science fiction films to stand the test of time - which is kind of inherent to the genre I suppose - and 'Alien' simply remains an outstanding achievement in that regard. It's a testament to the talent of everyone involved, but especially to the vision of director Ridley Scott. The film was crafted with so much love for every little detail, and the designs by Moebius, Chris Foss - and in particular the Lovecraftian horrors unleashed by Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger - are among the best and most iconic in any science fiction film. This isn't just an outstanding, timeless piece of entertainment: it's a work of art. 10 Stars out of 10.

"Alien","ivo-cobra8","20 February 2018","A masterpiece one of the best classic sci-fi horror films from the 70's I have ever saw and experience. The first time I saw this film was in the 97 when I was 13 years old because this film was so popular that time and even today people talk's about it. Watching the first time this film I must say I loved it. I love this film to death of all the sci-fi films today this one is the best one and beats them all. This is the real science fiction film about ""extraterrestrial life form"" it is interesting, brilliant about time in the space and life form that want's to whip whole humanity out. This is Ridley Scott's masterpiece and one of his best films of all time. Everything about this film is perfect, the script, the actors, puppetry, models, and special effects about Alien design. I would give this movie an 8 but it deserves a perfect 10 because it has a vision of the most imaginative directors on earth. Dan O'Bannon wrote brilliantly a story and screenplay with help from Ronald Shusett. Both of them make a brilliant imaginative story. This film has no plot holes I don't see them. Helen Horton as the voice of Mother, the Nostromo's computer was believable and realistic and well performed. The design for the parasite (the facehugger) was excellent designed and brilliant. Everyone from the cast in here at acting is spectacular and acts believable. I love all the characters: Parker, Brett, Lambert, Ripley, Ash, Captain Dallas, Kane and even Jonesy the cat. He was really trained I love that cat in this movie. The design about the ship Nostromo is fantastic and so is space and the computers in this film. The eponymous Alien and its accompanying elements were designed by the Swiss artist H. R. Giger which the effects and designs were excellent spectacular created in the film. Jerry Goldsmith makes an excellent music score for the film that I have enjoy it. My favorite scene in this film is when Parker torchers with flamethrower on Ash's corpse and burns his remains great a special effect. This movie stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto, Bolaji Badejo and Helen Horton they are all believable in their roles.This is my favorite science fiction film tough I prefer Aliens over this film (because it is my favorite film), The Thing, Leviathan even The Blob as a horror films because I enjoy them more but ""Alien"" is my favorite science fiction film the best of it's kind. 10/10 doesn't deserve the hate.","

"Alien","Fella_shibby","24 March 2021","Everything has already been said about this great film n there seems to be little left to say but lemme contribute a lil more by praising how good this film is.I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs n as a kid i found it to be a bit slow but was shaken by the chestburster scene.The facehugger terrified me as a kid.Revisited all the four parts in the early 2k on dvds which i own.Revisited this part again few days back as i am on Alien movie marathon n very impatient to check out Prometheus n Covenant.I feel that this part is inspired by Bava's Planet of the Vampires.The ruins with the skeletal remains, the design and shots of the ship itself does have the deja vu effect.This one is atmospheric n dark, gory at times, it has enuff stuff for sci fi fans, it also has slasher n war like tone.But the best thing is the feminist tone where in this part the women are not being cast as the helpless victims.","

"Alien","bob the moo","16 October 2001","The further we go in special effects, the more movies show us and ignore the unseen, the more people will return to dark horrors like this one.It's hard to look at this film without considering the sequels and knowing the alien itself, however when made the alien was mostly unseen and a mystery. It's difficult to forget what you've seen, but it's important to approach this film first if possible rather than joining the series late.It's amazing that this is over 20 years old - apart from the actors looking so young, the film doesn't feel dated at all. The sci-fi visions here are still bleak and futuristic as they were then - this is not the Star Trek vision of the future. The foreboding exists long before John Hurt spills his secret, Scott's direction is excellent throughout. Once the alien is ""born"" the tension is cranked up and the characters dispatched one by one (a formula we know oh-so well now!)However here the characters are not merely alien-food but have some dimension to them. Weaver is excellent, while the support cast is full of great support actors (Stanton, Kotto, Hurt, Skerritt, Holm), but of course the real star is the one we see least of.We barely see the alien in full detail, most of the time it is set in shadows, moving with deadly intent.The alien here is not simply a killing machine as seen in later films but is cruel with it. Witness the alien trap a female crew member and slowly rub up her leg, moving with slow seductive movements before moving with terrifying speed to kill another crew member sneaking up behind it. The slow movements betray the alien's pure cruelty.The film is a study in terror. It may not be as action packed as the other films in the series but it brings the claustrophobia of being hunted to a new level.","

"Alien","zetes","6 April 2000","Ridely Scott is such a minimalist in Alien that many sci-fi nuts find it slow and unexciting. So many people prefer Aliens, its sequel, to this one. I think Aliens, directed by James Cameron, is another sci-fi masterpiece (and maybe the best action film ever made), but I think Alien is much better. In fact, I would say that it is among the best films ever made, in sci-fi, only second to 2001. The plot absolutely lacks contrivance. All the plot points develop how they would naturally. And there are great surprises throughout the film. Even if you haven't seen the film, you know about the chest-bursting scene. You probably saw it parodied dozens of times. But watch the scene where Ian Holm reveals his secret! That is one amazing scene! I actually saw the sequel first, so I kind of knew that secret, too, but it still shocked me. It was so well directed.Notice how the dialogue works. It never particularly draws attention to itself. It actually reminds me of Robert Altman, how he directed such movies as Nashville, where many characters are speaking at the same time, and nothing seems more or less important than anything else. It is just like real life. Alien is one of the most realistic, documentary-like sci-fi films ever made. Also notice the setting. The Nostromo's design is so believable that I feel that I'm actually seeing a real space vehicle. The alien ship also beams with its spookiness.The characters are also extremely believable. They are so well written that even the first character who dies is completely developed. If you get the DVD, they actually created dossiers about each of the crew members. It also has extra scenes which round out the characters even more. I think Ripley is one of the most endearing characters in film history. Even in the last two sequels, which were visually interesting but not very well written or directed, Ripley held my interest. I teared up when she died at the end of 3. If they made a fifth one, I would go, no matter how terrible I knew it would be. The acting is also top-notch. Ian Holm, a great actor, gives one of his best performances here. I love the last scene that he is in. Truly a master. And of course Sigourney Weaver could have just as easily been nominated for an Oscar for her performance here as she was for Aliens. I wish she would make more movies. She's so talented.The most important part of a film, in my mind, is the mood. And boy, does Alien have one of the most genuinely spooky movies I've ever seen. Make sure you watch it after the sun has gone down. Also, watching it alone will help. The special effects are kind of cheap, but Scott knows this well enough. He only shows the alien for seconds at a time. Besides keeping us from seeing the shoddiness of those puppets, this technique makes the alien seem all the more creepy and mysterious. 10/10, no doubt at all (BTW, the symbols all over the Nostromo are the same insignias as those of the Purina Dog Chow company)","

"Alien","Infofreak","12 December 2002","'Alien' while technically science fiction is also one of the greatest horror/suspense movies ever made. Ridley Scott is now one of the most well known and successful directors in Hollywood, but I don't think anything he's made in the last ten years is a patch on this perfect film, which is a near masterpiece in my opinion. In fact, on reflection there are only three Scott movies I genuinely like, those being his first three. The last of these 'Blade Runner' was released twenty years ago now, so to me Scott is long past his use by date. Whatever, 'Alien' itself is a brilliant piece of work, and is almost flawless. Scott's direction is superb and everything else about it is outstanding - a strong script from Dan O'Bannon et al, an evocative score from Jerry Goldsmith, brilliant design and special effects, including the amazing contributions from H.R.Giger, all add up to an amazing movie experience. I also really liked how the cast were character actors and not ""stars"" so there was plenty of suspense generated as to who will live and who will die. This is something very few subsequent movies have done, 'Pitch Black' being one of the exceptions. Sigourney Weaver may be an icon as Ripley now, but when the movie was first released she was virtually unknown, having had a small cameo in Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' and not much else. The rest of the cast are equally as good. I especially enjoyed Yaphet Kotto ('Blue Collar') and the legendary Harry Dean Stanton ('Wise Blood') as the wise cracking ""below deck"" crew. Many people seem to prefer James Cameron's sequel 'Aliens' over this, but as I much prefer horror and suspense movies to action ones I think this is definitely the better movie, and still the strongest and most effective in the series. 'Alien' is a horror classic and an absolutely unforgettable movie that I can't recommend highly enough. If you haven't seen it before watch it immediately!","

"Alien","BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","15 April 2004","This is one of the finest science fiction films ever made. Everything is so carefully and expertly constructed to the point that repeated viewings are just as good as the first. Also, the atmosphere, along with the amazing sets, is real shocker and few movies have managed to create the same kind eerie feeling.The story starts with the crew of the cargo vessel ""Nostromo"" waking up before schedule. They soon realize their on-board computer has detected life on a nearby planet and they go to investigate. One of them unwillingly brings back an...ALIEN (!) which soon becomes a very unwanted passenger. The introduction of the title creature in the famous chest-burster scene is a real jolter. Especially if you watch it after dinner.The music, too, must be mentioned and it moves the story along with unrelenting terror. However, the lack of music, in certain scenes, works just as well and this combination makes for one of the best musical montages to be put on film.This is a classic film that spawned a series, which is good overall, and a bunch of copycats, many of which are just sad. ""Alien"" came first and it is easily one the best. 10/10Rated R: violence/gore and profanity","

"Alien","hellholehorror","4 May 2021","This was made in the seventies. Seventies. The picture quality is stunning. Undeniably stunning. The sound is perfect except minor issues regarding occasional muffled dialogue. God it looks good. Rivals and beats many films made thirty years later. The blend of suspense, horror, science-fiction is perfect. The budget is perfectly used. Perfect. I say stick with the theatrical version, the various director cuts are not as well paced, add irrelevant scenes and don't fix the one bit that annoys me - the jump cut on Ash's head. Stay theatrical and think of the best film ever made and you would possibly have this. There may be a scant few other films but this would be the first. The ending is so intense and fearful without cheap techniques. I love it. Very minor technical issues are forgotten through fear, fascination and legacy.","

"Alien","WalterFrith","22 January 2005","""In space, no one can hear you scream."" This remains my favourite tagline ever for a movie. When 'Alien' was released in 1979, it caused almost as much talk as 'Star Wars' did when released two years earlier. The science fiction genre was being revolutionized at this time and 'Alien' had a horror characteristic to it which was psychological, visually striking and compelling with the type of strength in silence not seen since '2001: A Space Odyssey' in 1968. Definitely a big influence in blockbuster film making, 'Alien' has spawned three sequels so far and is a great horror/science-fiction classic not to be missed. It is director Ridley Scott's best effort on the big screen for making fear the best character in the film.","

"Alien","deepfrieddodo","23 October 2022","Not only is Alien one of the greatest sci-fi films created, it is undoubtedly encapsulates all the best elements of the horror genre too.The plot is perfect. Simple enough that missed dialogue doesn't throw the audience out of the loop, yet complex enough to demonstrate the depth behind the context. Twists are utilised at the perfect moments to ensure that intrigue remains at a high while tension is at a constant. Characters superb, with no real stereotypes of tokenism added in to no effect.Visually, the 1979 release is still far more aesthetic than films released 40 years later. The sets are superb, costuming is great, and the lighting to capture the right atmosphere is perfect. Brief glimpses of the Xenomorph establish the fearsome foe without putting everything on show and lessening it's impact, and is a perfect example of why costuming and puppetry done right will always look better than CGI.An excellent cast, with Weaver's breakout role supported by the likes of Hurt and Holm. Dialogue is delivered realistically and always at the right intensity, and never out-of-step with the perfect directorial pacing.A phenomenal start to clear franchise material, which no matter how wayward later editions go, will always be a classic. Somehow Alien's sequel matches this performance too.","

"Alien","gftbiloxi","23 April 2005","ALIEN received mixed reviews when it debuted in 1979--largely from science fiction critics, who accused it of being little more than a sort of Friday the 13th in Outer Space, a blood-and-gore horror flick given a futuristic twist via special effects. But while these accusations have more than a little truth, it has been an incredibly influential film--and even today, in the wake of CGI effects, it still holds up extremely, extremely well.The story is well known: the crew of an interstellar craft responds to what seems a distress signal, only to encounter a remarkably lethal alien life form that boards their ship and sets about picking them off one by one. Some of the special effects are weak (the alien spacecraft and the android ""revival"" are fairly notorious). There is little in the way of character development, the film has a fairly slow pace, and the story itself is predictable; you can usually guess who is going to die next.BUT. The art designs are incredible: the entire look of the film, from the commercial nature of the spacecraft to the iconographic alien itself (brilliantly envisioned by Giger) is right on the money. Director Ridley Scott encouraged his cast to ad lib from the script, and the result is a shocking sense of realism--and the somewhat slow pace of the film and the predictability of the story gives it a sense of relentless and ever-mounting paranoia that is greatly enhanced by the tight sets and camera set-ups. With its odd mixture of womb-like organics and cold mechanics, ALIEN is a film calculated to send even the most slightly claustrophobic viewer into a fit of hysteria.The entire cast, led by Tom Skerrit and Sigorney Weaver, is very, very good--and the film abounds with memorable images and scenes ranging from John Hurt's encounter with the alien egg to Skerrit's search of the ship air ducts to Weaver's terrifying race against time as the ship counts down to self-destruct. Seldom has any film been so consistent in design, cast, direction, and out-and-out fear factor, and although certain aspects of ALIEN are open to legitimate criticism the end result is powerful enough to bring it in at a full five stars. A word of warning, however: you'll need to send the kids to bed for this one. And you'll probably be up half the night afterward yourself! Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer","

"Alien","BrandtSponseller","6 February 2005","Seven members of a space mining cargo ship who are headed back to Earth are awakened from hypersleep when their ship detects a signal from an intelligent civilization on a small, uncharted planet. When they locate the source of the signal, they find more than they bargained for, and all of their lives are endangered.My feelings about this first film in the Alien series have vacillated slightly over the years. I loved it when I first saw it as a young teenager in the theater back in 1979. Later, I wasn't as enamored with it, and had actually rated it as low as a 7 out of 10--at one point believing it to be my least favorite of the series. Now, however, my appreciation of the film has matured a bit, and I'm back to thinking it's a solid 10 out of 10.The film's strong points are rooted in director Ridley Scott's focused commitment to sustaining a desolate, dark atmosphere and gradually building suspense over the course of the film. Alien is unusual for its era in its pacing, its lack of comic relief, and its refusal to provide breaks from its growing tension. All three of these facts make it a somewhat ""difficult film"". It's not recommended for light viewing. It's not a ""popcorn film"". You have to be in the mood to sit down, slow down, concentrate, invest emotion, and let yourself be enveloped in the film's world.With Alien, Scott has created a kind of bleak tribute to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). This is evident in many characteristics of the film, such as the graceful slowness of the cinematography, editing and much of the action in the first section of the film, including sustained pans across sterile-looking environments and wide external shots of (a) hulking but elegant spacecraft, the personification of the ship's computer, known as ""Mother"" here rather than Hal, a few subtle instances of classical music, the surprise discovery of a monumental structure on another celestial body, and so on. However, there are no instances of pleasant psychedelia here, no retreats into dreamworlds, no messages of hope, no benevolence from alien beings. Alien is strictly concerned with making its sci-fi an issue of classic horror. At a base level, it is about a malevolent monster, first encountered in a dark, Gothic environment and later chasing our heroes through a cross between a haunted house and crypt-like labyrinths.Much has been said about visual artist H.R. Giger's alien and production design, and the film wouldn't be nearly as successful without it. Giger is largely responsible for the look of the beacon ship on the small planet, both its exterior and interior, the cocoon later encountered on the cargo ship, and the creatures. His work also inspired a lot of smaller elements, as can be seen in doorways, pipes, and other features of the cargo ship. Like most of his work, these features are a combination of metallic and organic, mechanical and biological, futuristic and Gothic. They complement the austere Kubrickian sensibility in a surprising but completely successful way.Scott also uses simple effects like steam, as well as unique lighting and sound effects to help build the film's thick tension. These techniques gradually become more conspicuous as the film goes on, finally culminating in a claustrophobic symphony of flashing lights, constantly hissing pipes and hoses, and an incessant audio alarm.Finally, the last key to the excellence of the film is the cast. Although a somewhat stereotypical movie-world ragtag bunch, their characterizations provide more depth than the norm, with Sigourney Weaver as the standout, in perhaps the defining role of her career, and one of the more admirable filmic portrayals of a woman--she's the smartest, most sensible, strongest, and certainly most sexy of the bunch.","

"Alien","Anonymous_Maxine","31 July 2004","I'm a little confused as to why there was a cat on board in the first place. Needless to say, given that there was an entire crew on board the Nostromo, a merchant vessel carrying, if I remember correctly, something like 20,000,000 tons of mineral ore, there was hardly a lack of companionship. At any rate, I can easily brush aside my curiosity about the effort that went into designing the life support system that would have been needed to keep the cat alive along with the rest of the humans as they traveled for months on end in deep sleep. It doesn't matter, because the cat was involved in most of the scariest scenes. That being said, I think that one of the things that really makes Alien great is that it explains all the twists and turns of its plot in great detail, which is almost unheard of in science fiction and horror films. No one displays ludicrous behavior to allow for the construction of bloody, gory death scenes, the alien, masterfully designed, isn't rushing across the screen in every scene to allow for maximum payoff of the costume design, we don't even see it until well past the halfway point in the movie. Like Jaws, Alien takes its time to allow the characters to gradually grasp the enormity of their situation. The Nostromo is a merchant ship, which allows for a non-military crew to be faced with a mortal enemy that they do not understand. The ship intercepts a strange transmission that must be from an intelligent source since it repeats itself every twelve seconds, and so it wakes up the crew to investigate. The subtlety of the way the conflict is introduced is very important. The transmission didn't just appear, the ship awoke the crew months ahead of schedule, because it was programmed to do so should anything like that happen. And to the chagrin of a couple of the money financial-minded crew members, it is also in their contracts to investigate any such occurrence. The movie is covering its tracks very thoroughly and to great effect. When they reach the planet from which the transmission originated, they find the spectacular discovery of what appears to be a crashed alien spaceship, complete with a dead alien pilot still in his chair. A brief look at the body suggests that the pilot may have exploded from the inside, creating curiosity about his death that the movie never satisfies but doesn't need to. One of the crew members discovers what look like dozens of leathery eggs, gets attacked, and is brought back on board the ship. Significantly, protocol is broken to get him and the alien life form back on board for medical attention. When they discover that the alien has blood that melts through the hull of the ship like thermite, a new and particularly difficult challenge arises. How do they kill a deadly enemy without making it bleed? And to make matters worse, the very ship is programmed to work against them. They are in the most hostile environment imaginable, worse than anywhere on earth. They are being stalked by an unknown creature that they can't injure for fear of damaging the hull of the spaceship, and the ship itself has placed the survival of the alien life form above their own survival. They have to trick the alien into submission without letting the ship know what's going on. Even HAL wasn't THIS creepy.Released at a time when science fiction was probably at the most popular that it had ever been (and possibly ever will be) thanks to the recent release of Star Wars and the soon to follow first sequel, Alien came along and capitalized in an area of science fiction that people evidently were very eager for, the darker, more sinister and dangerous side. The side of science fiction with the bloody deaths rather than light sabers and heroes. In fact, by looking at the way people probably saw Alien in 1979 and the way they see it now, you can learn a lot about how science fiction and horror have evolved over the years. Back then, this was horror/science fiction. Today, it's science fiction/horror. But while it was more horrible in 1979 than it is today, it is significant that, while other films that have come along over the years have overshadowed Alien as far as the intensity of the horror, the movie has lost none of its powerful effect. Rather than reinventing the science fiction genre by adding horror to it, it is now maintaining the life of the science fiction genre by reminding us of how good it can be when it's done right.","

"Alien","boardertrash","23 December 2022","I'm often amazed that people prefer Aliens to the original, I guess it's down to personal taste but in my opinion the first film is far and away the best. It's the way Ripley's whole world just unravels gradually from the get go, the pacing is sublime and it simply doesn't have to rely on tons of action set pieces like the second film does. My assumption is some people find it too slow but everytime I watch it I just marvel at every scene, the effort that went into every detail. The true mark of what an achievement this film was for the time is also how nothing appears dated even now in HD or in 4k, there are countless instances in the second film where it's blatantly obvious scale models have been used and it always bugs me. You have to remember this was made when Christopher Reeve's Superman was about which vfx's look terrible in comparison, blows your mind doesn't it?! Don't get me wrong I enjoy all of the Alien franchise movies, they do gradually worsen in sequence apart from Prometheus which is joint second place for me. I won't go into script or acting, needless to say both are top drawer and feel completely authentic and natural.A masterpiece! Simple as that.","

"Alien","chrishn","6 February 2005","In ""Alien"" we follow a seven man crew en-route to earth on board the huge space freighter ""Nostromo"". The crew is in cryosleep, but the on board computer interrupts the journey when a foreign radio signal is picked up. It originates from an uninhabited planet and the crew lands to investigate. There they make contact with an alien life-form...What makes Alien so great is the constant feel of uneasiness. Right from the beginning you have a feeling that something is wrong. The crew is not particularly friendly towards each other, and you truly feel all the in-group tension. The ship itself is a huge worn out industrial-style maze of halls and corridors, and it feels more like a prison than a place to live. It is as if not only the alien but also the ship itself is against the humans. The Alien itself is the scariest monster in history because it is a ruthless, soul-less parasite completely devoid of any human or civilized traits. The design of the monster is a stroke of genius. Sure it has a humanoid form, but it has no facial traits or anything else which could give away emotions or intentions. Its actions reveals no weaknesses nor civilized intelligence. The Alien is more or less the opposite of everything human and civilized, plus the creature is more well-adapted to the inhumane interior of the ship than the humans who build it. To sum up, you then have a setting where the humans are caught in a web of in-group tensions, an inhospitable ship and the perfect killer which thrives in the ships intestines. You almost get the feel that the humans are the ones who are alienated to each other and to their own ship.Ridley Scott tells the story with a perfectly synchronized blend of visuals and sounds. The actors do a superb job, portraying their characters in a subtle but very realistic way. The seven man crew is not a bunch of Hollywood heroes. They are ordinary people with strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes. In this way they all seem so fragile when confronted with the enemy. As mentioned the ship is very claustrophobic and Ridley Scott adds to the eeriness by using camera movement, lights and shadows in an effective way. The living quarters are bright and should be comfortable to the crew, but there is something sterile about it all. The rest of the ship is basically a huge basement. The music by Jerry Goldsmith underlines the eeriness so well, and the movie wouldn't have worked without his score. Combined with the sounds of the ship it all adds to the uneasiness. This is not a story about heroic people who boldly teams up against evil. It's a story about ordinary people facing true fear, which is the fear without a face. The fear we can't understand and can't negotiate with, because its only goal is to survive on the expense of us. It's a story where some people bravely fight back whilst others are destroyed by the terror. It's a story where people a killed in a completely random way. There is no higher-order justice behind who gets to live and who dies. All seven characters are just part of a race where the fittest - not necessarily the most righteous - will prevail, and all seven characters start the race on an equal footing. None of them are true heroes, and none of them are true villains. All the above makes Alien so great as a horror movie. The terror isn't just the Alien itself, it's the entire atmosphere which gets so effectively under your skin, that you just can't shrug it off after the end credits like you can with so many other Hollywood horror movies. The title ""Alien"" doesn't just refer to the monster, it is the theme of the movie and it is the feeling you have during and after the movie. 9/10","

"Alien","neil-douglas2010","7 December 2022","A classic in sci fi horror movies, this one gets you right from the start. It's a claustrophobic film and never lets up, the trouble is it's been remade so any times and never bettered.The crew of the Nostromo have just woken up but are nowhere near Earth, instead their ship has received a distress beacon. Except it's more of a warning, and on the planet Kane (John Hurt) is attacked by an alien lifeform. Trying to get back to the ship Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) says the land crew should be put in isolation. Dallas (Tom Skerritt) disagrees and lets them on the ship. BAD IDEA, as one by one the crew is killed, of course there is a bad apple. I won't tell you who but it's pretty obvious as the film progresses. Sequels followed, all starring Weaver and they're all good in their own ways, but this is the superior movie in every way. It certainly helps with a great cast and a superb special effects crew.","

"Alien","Patuquitos","31 January 2005","Back in early 20th century, Lumière brothers didn't have a clue of what they were playing with. I'm freaking sure that if somebody could have magically told them that thanks to their work, a movie like 'Alien' would have been made in the future, they both would have died of a sudden, shocked by the consequences of their labor, like an honest scientist would if he was shown an evil use of his research. In that sense, but in the best way imaginable, 'Alien' is the atomic bomb.In my opinion, 'Alien' is the only perfect movie in the history of cinema. Of course, this could be debatable, but of all the films I've watched since I was born, this is the only one in which I haven't been able to find the slightest flaw. It gets a golden ten out of ten. Bright, solid and massive.I could go on with a panegyric, but I'll try to be short and accurate:The direction is just perfect. Every shot is marvellous, every movement of the camera is breathtaking. There is absolutely nothing you could add or subtract. Touch it, and you spoil it. Seriously.The acting is splendid. The performances build a credible world centuries away. I don't know about you, but this take on the future was unveliabably acceptable. Sigourney Weaver is more than a revelation, John Hurt is a master, and the rest are nothing short of marvellous.The script is a work of art, the story is mesmerizing, well-constructed, well-developed, and free of absurd twists. Its simplicity and efectiveness are yet, 25 years after, to be matched.The atmosphere is pure genius. Gothic, claustrophobic and sometimes baroque. The use of light and dark is beyond description, the use of sound is as creepy as it gets.The FX are the best possible for 1979. In the time of the release, some scenes were stomach churning.The score. Jerry Goldsmith's work matches the images so perfectly it seems to bleed from them. It is and will be the best soundtrack for a sci-fi flick in space ever.The tagline. ""In space, no one can hear you scream"". THIS is a tagline.And, of course... the alien. The only alive creature that can steal Weaver the movie. Its design is the most innovative I've seen. It has spawned dozens of disgraceful imitations. This is the real deal. Not only the look, but the complete design of a life form, including biological features. Acid instead of blood. Jaws inside jaws. What more could you possibly want? This is how a movie is done.A very good sign of a movie that has gone down in history is the amount of collectively well remembered scenes. Well, 'Alien' has so many that I won't go into it. This movie contains so many iconic scenes that has become an icon itself.So, what else? I urge all young directors to watch this movie a zillion times, as I've already done, and take notes all along. But not in order to rip off from it, as many others have done, but to learn, learn, learn, learn and learn how a movie should be done. 'Casablanca'? You must be joking.Oh, I almost forget! There's a lovable cat in it.RATING: 10","

"Alien","shortround8391","17 April 2009","Alien....the creature......the film.....the legend. The one that started it all, the one that led to one of the greatest sequels ever made, one that got a comic book mini-series and 2 cross-over films with ""Predator"". This is THE film. And without a doubt, the greatest horror film ever created, and this totally makes ""Halloween"" look like ""Chicken Little"". You can forget about all those rubbish ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies, 'cause ""Alien"" just takes horror up to so many levels! In ""Alien"", we find ourselves in the distant future with a crew just coming back from a haul of 20 million tons of ore back to Earth. But while the crew members are in stasis, their ship picks up an ""SOS"" from a nearby planet, and once the crew is awakened, they are forced by the ""Company"" regulations to follow that signal. And then when they land on the planet and it turns out that something terrifying is in store for them, when a hostile organism attaches itself to one of the crew members. And later on, it becomes clear that the crew member was being impregnated and then dies a horrible, violent death from a deadly breed of an other-worldly life-form. And now the rest of the crew must fight off the creature.As other classic films should always have, ""Alien"" does great on the characters. And of course, the most recognizable one is the lead woman, Ellen Ripley who is played then-unknown Sigourney Weaver. She provides a very human face and you're gonna feel like you're actually watching a real-life woman in here, and it could be because of her accent, or her mannerisms. But as the film progresses, she develops into a more mentally tougher woman while combating the Alien. There are times when she totally keeps it cool, times when she's afraid, times when she's angry, and times when its just Ripley being Ripley. And thanks to Weavers acting talents, she can really dish out one hell of a character.The rest of the supporting cast are nothing short of spectacular, Parker and Brett are the selfish, sarcastic men who only want to make a profit. And through most of the film, you can feel the tension that Ripley and Parker have. Lambert, who one of my favorites from here is the second woman who happens to be the opposite of Ripley, a total coward. Dallas, who the viewer might get the vibe that HE is the main character in the 1st 15 minutes or so, is pretty much the leader here. Kane, is the tired, dead-looking guy who is the one that carries the alien species inside of him. And finally, Ash is the one with the sinister purpose and you start to suspect that he's up to no good at some point. And movie characters need to have their own personalities and that's what ""Alien"" has.And as for the Alien itself, well what can i say? It is the most horrifying creature in the history of cinema, period. I mean, how could you stop it? It has acid for blood, and is very lethal to fight face-to-face. And the special effects were over 20 years ahead of its time. The face-hugger on Kane looked so freaking real, that you're gonna be scared just by looking at it, even it doesn't do anything except breathe most of the time. And the sets couldn't have been better, very futuristic, yet there's always something ominous and dark about them.The suspense is impossible to resist as the sequences deliver the chills at times when you least expect it, and when you do expect something to happen, nothing happens. And ""Alien"" is one of the very few horror films that understands that you can't scare people by raking up the bodies and the blood, but you have to build up the suspense to do it. And director Ridley Scott is such a genius, and he shows that here, he absolutely knows how to make any kind of film, ones that can scare (Alien), one that can sadden (Thelma and Louise), and one that can excite/thrill (Gladiator). And Ridley really keeps up the dark atmosphere, especially in the beginning when there's no talking for the 1st 5 minutes or so, we get the feeling that something's not right all the time. Some parts are very quiet and very depressing and we feel exactly what we see.This is the legend that I'm talking about here, folks. Don't miss the chance to see this, because it will scare the living daylights outta you more than any other movie you're gonna see in your life. Take my word for it....I'm practically a movie buff, so I know what I'm talking about....","

"Alien","andyajoflaherty","15 August 2023","A timeless horror film, Alien follows the crew of the Nostromo, a mining ship that is returning to Earth with its payload. Intercepting a distress call from an unchartered planet, the ship wakes up the crew from hypersleep to investigate. Once there they find a crashed alien ship that is full of mysterious eggs, and when one opens unleashing a parasite onto one of the crew, they take him back to the ship for treatment. After a while it falls off dead, and the crew member seems fine... until a creature erupts from his chest, killing him instantly. The rest of the crew try to catch it, unaware that it has rapidly grown into an 8ft tall killing machine with acid for blood. Trapped with it on the Nostromo with nowhere to hide, the fight for survival begins...That synopsis sounds like a typical b-movie horror, but this film avoids that trap thanks largely to the combined talents of Swiss artist H. R. Giger and director Ridley Scott. The first thing that stands out is just how incredible this film looks. The ship looks completely convincing, looking worlds away from the shiny plastic looking sets of earlier sci fi films. This is thanks to the grimy, broken retro looking style that has given the film a timeless look. The ship looks like a real place, and the same can be said of the alien ship and mysterious planet. The film also excels in how it simultaneously builds tension and character development. The characters and dialogue also feel completely believable, and the first hour of the film is spent not only building the audiences relationships with them but also shows their relationships with each other. This means that when they start dying you actually care, and this is something surprisingly few horror films get right.Another thing the film gets right is in hiding it's main star. On first viewing you genuinely have no idea who will survive and who won't, and Ripley doesn't reveal herself as the last survivor and the film's main character until she is the last one standing. Until that point the crew as a whole is the protagonist, putting you right in there with them, and the claustrophoboc setting and phenomenal soundtrack all combine to have you on the verge of panic for the entire second half.And then, of course there's the creature itself. H. R. Giger is known for his hyper sexualised and biomechanical surrealist art, and when the creature is born from a nightmare he had, then you know the monster is going to deliver. On first viewing, the alien is constantly changing its appearance - first the egg, then the facehugger, then the chestburster, then finally the full grown alien. You never know what to expect, and Ridley Scott wisely chose to only show parts of it during the death scenes, letting your imagination do the work. Once the full creature is shown though... wow! A biomechanical nightmare of the highest order, the alien is horrifying beyond comprehension, yet is also oddly gracefull and beautifully designed. It's in absolutely no hurry whatsoever to murder the crew, every kill and all movement being slow and deliberate, and thanks to its mechanical appearance blends perfectly in with the grubby Nostromo. Every shadow, every pipe could be the alien in disguise, and the final act of this film is a masterclass in suspense where the alien could be anywhere.All in all, this is an unbelievable horror film that I quite frankly cannot believe is 40+ years old. It is practically flawless in every way, and has an incredible monster the likes of which we will probably never see again. I genuinely think this is not only the greatest horror film of all time, but is one of the best films ever made in general, and everyone must see it... fan of horror or not...","

"Alien","maryolalov","14 February 2017","Alien has a slow and mysterious beginning. It starts like nothing special - some people eating and talking on a space ship. But it gets more intense when they detect an unknown planet and land on it so they can explore it. The audience has to wait more than 1 hour to see the thing they paid for - the xenomorph. And this waiting makes its emergence one of the greatest moments in the cinematic history. Still we see the xenomorph only 3 or 4 times which is quite disappointing but this makes the alien more mysterious and gives the movie a horror character. And of course another reason we see the xenomorph so rarely is because the CGI wasn't very well developed at that time and it was pretty hard to make the alien's appearance. Alien(1979) is a great start for the Alien anthology and even though the bad CGI it's the best movie in the whole anthology. The movie is worth watching.","

"Alien","Ricky_Roma__","15 December 2005","What makes Alien such an effective horror film is how quiet it is. After all, most horror films make the mistake of equating fear with noise. But that's often a mistake, as silence is usually infinitely more effective. And so it is with Alien. The scariest moments are all devoid of intrusive scoring, jagged editing and overblown sound effects. Instead most of the sound and music is pulled out and shots are held for a long time.One of the best examples is when Brett is killed. He has to chase after a cat and he's led into a dark corner of the ship. You know he's going to get killed but Ridley Scott knows that you know. Therefore the sequence is dragged out. All the time you're waiting. You're waiting for the inevitable. But Scott doesn't rush things. He racks up the tension by having Brett wander for an inordinate length of time and by having him wash his face in a shower of dripping water as chains rattle in the background. And when the Alien does appear, it's not with a sudden jolt. It just appears quietly behind Brett before killing him. And the way that the death is played on the face of the cat, which has a look of almost stunned curiosity, makes the whole sequence rather spooky. It's not really a crash, bang, wallop sort of horror film.Not that there aren't plenty of jump moments. There are actually quite a few. But because the lead-up is so quiet and ominous it makes the pay-off a whole more effective. For example, when Kane looks into the egg. Again the sequence takes its time, but when he finally has a peek and the facehugger leaps out, it has the perfect timing of a great joke.Another fantastic piece of timing is when the Alien takes Dallas. You go through another long, drawn out sequence of him scurrying through narrow air vents before the Alien finally pops out of a dark corner. But although the moment is fantastically timed, the lead up is where the fun lies. Although I do have to say that the lead up is probably the most frightening thing in the film. Dallas scurries through narrow corridors trying to take the Alien out, but you know it's futile. And the dark, claustrophobic corridors are full of iris-shaped doors that open and close slowly and forebodingly, which really does add to the air of dread that fills the sequence. And the tracker is the icing on the cake  it racks up the tension to an even greater extent.The second most frightening sequence is when Ripley is finally alone in the ship. She sets the Nostromo to self-destruct so that she can take the shuttle but then with strobe lights flashing she sees the Alien. She then goes back and tries to reverse the self-destruct sequence, but it's too late. It's frightening because Ripley has to run around the ship, not knowing where the Alien might be. No longer does she have the option of just hiding. And with everyone dead she no longer has anyone to talk to or help her out. She's all alone. But perversely, once everyone's dead, the film finally gets loud. There's a countdown sequence (which is brilliant in the way that it adds tension) and the ship begins to destruct. Just when Ripley might have needed the silence to find out where the Alien is, she has to run around in cacophony of noise knowing that the Alien could be anywhere.But the silence comes back in the final sequence, and it's quite ingenious the way that the Alien is camouflaged in the shuttle. I nearly messed myself when I first saw it as a kid.What I also like about the final sequence is that it's weirdly sexual. Ripley strips down to her underwear and then the Alien appears. And the Alien then begins almost stroking the console it's resting on. And of course, Ripley penetrates the Alien a harpoon. Nice.Another excellent bit of weird sexuality is when Ash the robot tries to choke Ripley with a magazine. He shoves it her mouth and he looks rather turned on as she gags on it. Perhaps robots don't come with all the parts. Perhaps this is his way of venting his frustration. But there's also the way that the Alien kills Lambert. Its tail inches up the insides of her thigh and then you cut away and hear her screaming like she's being violated  the screaming is actually pretty damn chilling. And of course, Kane getting ripped open goes back to the male fear of childbirth. (The birth scene is still great. The blood, the sound and the way it takes the Alien two or three attempts to burst through is fantastic. But I do have to say that the way the Alien shoots off the table looks rather dodgy.) Going back to the Lambert killing, though As well as being chilling, this scene is also quite frustrating because Parker (Yaphet Kotto) gets killed as well. I mean, Parker is just The Man. I swear he could have taken the Alien had it not been for the cowardly Lambert. (It's quite surprising that the coward and the black character survive so long  they're usually the first two to go.) But although I dig Parker, I think Ian Holm as Ash delivers the best performance. It's quite subtle the way that he hints at his true identity  I like the way he jogs on the spot to get his joints working. And he's so smug and slimy. He's more of a villain than the Alien.But I think everything in the film is fantastic  the music, the special effects, the sequence on the alien planet, the production design, the moody atmosphere, the script I just wish I had more room to waffle.","

This nail-biting picture contains tension from start to finish , gory scenes aplenty , thrills , some strong scares , slime , emotion , entertainment and good acting . It is a superb cinematic combination of Sci-Fi , monster movie and terror . This is a brutal , considerable violent and exciting sci-fi thriller that scales new heights of savagery even by the standards of the 70s and 80s . The result is a throughly violent but undeniably thrilling action movie with a strong cast giving sweatily good value to their abrasive characters . Spectacular as well as bloody slaughter sequences took long time to shoot and were extremely difficult to make . Magnificently designed creature by the artist HR Giger , it was conceptual artist Ron Cobb who came up with the idea that the Alien should bleed acid . Extraordinary as well as astounding special effects in the chestburster scenes , the rumor that the cast, except for John Hurt, did not know what would happen during scenes is partly true and it was filmed in one take with four cameras; for instance, Veronica Cartwright did not expect to be sprayed with blood. The ending part is particularly exciting with Sigourney Weaver battling the malicious alien . ¨Alien¨ is clearly inspired by ¨It ¡ the terror from beyond space¨ . Sigourney Weaver breathes fire into Ripley and remaining actors are all magnificent as the crew of a futurist starship such as Tom Skerritt who is awesome in compelling lead role as commandant , Harry Dean Stanton , Veronica Cartwright , Yaphet Kotto , John Hurt and special mention to Ian Holm . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Ridley Scott who keeps everything bouncing at an absolutely frantic pace . Ridley Scott cites three films as the shaping influences on his movie: George Lucas' Star Wars (1977) and Stanley Kubrick's 2001 (1968) for their depiction of outer space, and Tobe Hooper's Texas chain saw massacre (1974) for its treatment of horror .It is followed by ¨Aliens ¨, also visually astounding by James Cameron with Paul Reiser , Bill Paxton , Jenette Goldstein , Lance Henriksen ; Alien 3 ¨ in which the alien regenerates and causes wreak havoc on isolated planet prison , being directed by David Fincher with Charles S Dutton , Paul McGann , Charles Dance ; ¨Alien: Resurrection¨ by Jean Pierre Jeunet with Winona Ryder , Dominique Pinon , Ron Perlman , Gary Dourdan and Michael Wincott . All of them starred by the great Sigourney Weaver who performed one of the best female leads created in years .

"Alien","exterminator_99","12 March 2002","As the credits of ""Alien"" open, the slowly paced opening titles and soft, eerie score give some indication of what viewers will experience when watching this film.  It starts off so unassumingly that first-time viewers are unlikely to be moved by the story or inspired by the slight character development in the film's first half.  It is in fact this lack of certainty that makes ""Alien"" work so well, for as the film hits it second half it shifts dramatically from slow space road movie to an intergalactic haunted house fright show.  This flip in drama, pace and tension makes for an unnerving ride into the unknown and results in one of the landmark sub-genre-sci-fi movies of the 20th century. The film is directed by Englishman Ridley Scott, who had a total of one feature and numerous commercials under his belt when he took control of proceedings.  Since the success of ""Alien"", Scott has had an uneven career with highlights like ""Blade Runner"", ""Thelma and Louise"", ""Gladiator"" and most recently ""Black Hawk Down"" and low points like ""Legend"", ""G.I. Jane"" and the bore-fest ""1492"".  ""Alien"" represents the overtly stylistic and slick approach Scott brings to his films, traits that are useful in science fiction but can sometimes seem out of place in more realistic genres. Here Scott retires the glitz and glamour of ""Star Wars"", which had been released two years before ""Alien"".  Instead he portrays the spacecraft and crew as nothing more than a cargo ship and a rag tag bunch of intergalactic truckers.  This works very well, as the viewer gets the distinct sense of the tedium and oppressive vastness of space travel.  The way the crew are so nonchalant about visiting another planet makes the audience feel that yes, perhaps one day man will view space travel with a shrug. The opening scene shows us a huge spaceship, named the Nostromo, returning to earth with 20,000,000 tonnes of mineral ore on board.  The crew sleep in hibernation, until the onboard computer awakens them.  It seems the computer has picked up a possible distress signal on an alien planet.  Under the law of the nameless and faceless 'Company', the crew are obliged to investigate. The waking scene is superbly filmed.  Kane (John Hurt) slowly rises, like a chick from and egg.  Squinting and only partially awake, slow dissolves from one angle of Kane to another emphasise his delirium and partial consciousness.  The final dissolve dissipates to the mess hall.  Here we meet the entire crew of the Nostromo for the first time. The ship is led by Dallas (Tom Skerrit), with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) as the first officer.  Ash (Ian Holm) is the odd, skittish science officer, Kane (John Hurt) is weathered but adventurous, Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) is the whiny and weak navigation officer, and Parker (Yaphet Kotto) and Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) are the engineering grunts.  The ship is controlled by Mother, a mute version of HAL 9000 from 1968's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  Like ""2001"", the reasons for having humans on board is unknown; they almost seem pointless as the ship can basically control itself.  Are they simply pawns or guinea pigs awoken at the will of the computer? They respond to the distress signal after landing on the desolate planet. The beacon is tracked to a derelict spaceship, which Kane, Lambert and Dallas enter.  Curious and naïve, Kane wonders into a cavern of eggs. Stumbling on the slippery surface, he slips and comes into contact with the living contents of the egg.  With the parasite attached to his face, Dallas and Lambert rush Kane back to the ship. On board Ripley, who is now in command, demands that Kane be kept in quarantine for 24 hours.  Against her wishes, the odd Ash lets the three crew in.  Upon removing Kane's helmet they find a claw shaped being attached to his face.  It eventually falls off and dies and amazingly, Kane awakens, seemingly unscathed. At this stage the film remains slow and ponderous.  Intent on getting back to earth, they have one final meal before returning to hibernation.  As they eat Kane convulses violently and a creature bursts through his chest.  In utter disbelief the crew watch it skuttle away to the far reaches of the ship.From this point the film takes off.  Space and distance are enclosed as Scott uses a brilliant mix of close ups and wide angled shots to display the vastness of the Nostromo and the claustrophobia in the crew. The alien and set design are outstanding.  The massive sexual overtones of Swiss artist's H.R. Giger's alien and derelict ship are truly breathtaking, as is the futuristic-retro styling of Michael Seymour's sets.  Grubby yet cool, the production quality of ""Alien"" is something to admire. It took seven more years before a sequel was made and when James Cameron took over the directing chair he revolutionised the series by making it all out action over spooky sci-fi with ""Aliens"".  It may be a better movie, but the original remains a quality stand alone film and a landmark in the sci-fi horror sub genre that has not been matched by any other saga.","

"Alien","petra_ste","12 March 2014","Less is more in the horror genre. Give us a fight between a giant humanoid albino and an octopus-like creature and we'll think of the special effects guy in front of his screen. Show us a maze of dark corridors where a monster may be hiding, and our pulse rate rises. We don't need to be bludgeoned in the head with horrific imagery: glimpsing something creepy out of the corner of the eye is more than enough.Alien's closest kinship is not to the exhilarating but vastly different sequel Aliens, and certainly not to the clunky prequel Prometheus, but to its contemporaries Jaws and The Thing, horror movies as lean and mean as hungry tigers, masterpieces tapping on primordial fears. For Alien, it's predators and rape: the first is self-explanatory, the second a disturbing undertone running through the movie, with the creature's attacks portrayed as increasingly sexualized in nature.The quintessential contained sci-fi/horror, Alien's iconic status is a product of many factors: Scott's masterful direction, a fine cast, Giger's unparalleled reptilian monster and O'Bannon's script, as vicious as a bear trap ready to snap. The brilliance of the premise - reminiscent of an episode of Van Vogt's The Voyage of the Space Beagle - lies in implying a dark, Lovecraftian universe of looming threats, both horribly dangerous and beyond mankind's understanding. Then of course came Prometheus and started putting tags on what was best left implied.At the end, Ian Holm's Ash says it best: ""Perfect organism. Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility.""10/10.","

"Alien","vithiet","9 June 2019","I've seen this movie many times before but just watched the Director's Cut for the first time. Besides a couple of scenes with very dated special effects, it has aged very well and remains a classic that set up all the rules for this type of movie. Younger generations may think it's a bunch of predictable, overused tropes but they should keep in mind this is the movie that inspired everything else they might have seen!
Having watched the original Blade Runner recently to prepare for Blade Runner 2049, it's also interesting to notice how much of the atmosphere and gritty elements/shots in Alien help mold what would become another genre-defining movie for Ridley Scott.","

"Alien","nycritic","18 February 2006","Before gore, special effects, and the denouement of the alien itself in future sequels, this was the movie that revolutionized the concept of the ""haunted house"" and merged it in a seamless sieve with ""body horror"" and its ultimate intrusion into our own most intimate space.The story had been done before, in different genres, never veering too far from its horror origins. Lovecraft (and others) had written about expeditions that had gone to ""investigate"" and ""collect important data"" only to find themselves being hunted down one by one, be it an unseen terror or their own fears.Ridley Scott's ALIEN looks and feels like a science fiction movie. However, it is not. Everything in its look and tone suggests horror of a more cerebral kind. When three crew members come across what seems to be a large space-jockey with a thing attached to its face, dead, we feel our stomach turn. If something that small was able to take over a creature this large, they are in deep trouble here. The scene is masterful, restrained, but a classic in the horror-movie sense: it's as if we had been witness to terrible events which had taken place and decided to get to the bottom of it. Scott tightens the noose employing age-old tricks of the horror genre and only once shows blood and guts -- one which follows a calm dinner sequence. He never allows the viewer to get a true glimpse of this sadistic killer much like Spielberg in JAWS and this becomes nerve-wracking because again, fear of the unseen is more powerful than what comes into view. The theory dictates: ""I was afraid of that thing? I thought it was bigger!"" All we see of this alien are his teeth and in one memorable, twisted scene, his tail snaking up Lambert's (Veronica Cartwright) leg. Later on, as Ripley (Sigourney Weaver in her breakthrough role), the quintessential Final Girl, makes her escape, it is possible to hear Lambert shrieking. What the alien is doing to her we can only imagine and recoil.","

The random Cat on board makes them more relatable.Once they venture outside the tension is cranked upto about 8 and seemingly very slowly throughout the movie ends at about 50.The face hugger scene is legendary and from thereafter it is a hunt to catch this Alien and all we know is it bleeds acid.It grows to a mammoth size very quickly and it starts to puck off the crew one by one revealing just a tiny bit more deatail each time and you have absolutely no idea who is next (Obviously Ripley survives but audiences in 1979 wouldn't have known that) This is because all the cast are treated as equal and no one is given more star treatment than anyone else.Throw in an Android conspiracy swerve and there you have it one of the best movies ever made.The claustrophobic setting is also amazing.The ending where the Alien has escaped and is on board the escape pod is terrifying.One of the best paced films ever as well.Did I mention that i think the Cat was great too.","

"Alien","ForTheMostPart1999","8 November 2022","Alien is a well done, out-of-this-world horror film that leaves some good scares and some epic scenes. The alien itself was splendidly creepy, the humanoid was really neat, and the spaceship was awesome. Most of the main characters were not all that compelling, but with a story like this, it all mixes together nicely. This also included some well designed special effects, including the alien, and especially the cargo ship that carried the crew (and the cat). I can certainly see why this was a big hit during it's time, and as mentioned before, I would have to say that it still is a really good hit today.","

"Alien","Pluto-3","14 August 1998","The beginning of one of the greatest series of all time. This film will always remain a classic. It's scary, influential and insanely entertaining. Not just that but Ridley Scott actually has a great sense of style and mood and he plays with that a lot, to make us shiver. There's also an interesting mystery surrounding the Alien which we know practically nothing about. Sigourney Weaver is just as powerful as usual and really brings strength to the film; they make one. Last but not least, the musical score. Wow! It's fantastic. I think the Alien series is known for that aspect as well. Let's hope they'll continue the series and dang we need it all on DVD !","

"Alien","SnoopyStyle","25 October 2013","An alien distress call from an uncharted planet awaken the crew of the deep space towing vessel Nostromo. They go down to the planet to investigate only to bring back something dangerous.The story is a fairly simple creature feature in a spaceship. Ridley Scott took that simple story and gave it everything needed to make a new standard in sci-fi horror. Before it the sci-fi horror is the mainstay of B-movie schlock. After it the genre reach a new golden age. The same way that Star Wars pushed the envelope, the same can be said of Alien.The atmosphere is fantastic. Ridley Scott has packed in some iconic scenes. Who can forget the meal scene? It's going down in movie history. That are some movies that transcend a simple movie. This is one of them.","

"Alien","I_should_be_reading_a_book","21 July 2019","They don't go any better in Sci-Fi/Horror. Even tho it shows its age --computers, technology, props and costumes- it grabs you like a hook in your belly from the start. Young Sigurney Weaver and Veronica Cartwright provide a high breeze of fresh air in the otherwise oppressive mouldy interiors. It was Ridley Scott at his best, along with other early masterpieces like his much accoladed debut 'The Duellists'. It is one of those films that set landmarks and that you don't tire of watching time and again. You will find yourself longing towards the era when films were created with physical props and costumes instead of present CGI gluttony. One of the true choice films for your top 100.","

"Alien","dfloro","28 November 2021","First, I feel the need to add a disclaimer before recommending everybody, who hasn't already seen it, watch ""Alien."" If you're prone to anxiety attacks, or if thrillers just make you unduly anxious, don't watch this movie all by yourself. It will scare the holy h#!/ out of you, and completely creep you out as well.For a producer/director such as Ridley Scott with a lengthy filmmaking career, which has had huge successes (e.g., ""Gladiator"" & ""Thelma and Louise""), a few near-misses, and major duds (like ""The Last Duel,"" which came and went without fanfare just last month), there's not a whole lot left to prove. He started out by making a couple of genre-mixing science fiction classics, first combining a ""monster"" lurking in-the-dark thriller with a strong ensemble cast led by the first truly plausible (and enviable) action heroine, Ripley (as wonderfully played by Sigourney Weaver), in this movie. Then a couple of years later, he would combine sci-fi with film noir, borrowing the newly famous Harrison Ford in the Humphrey Bogart role, for the iconic film ""Blade Runner.""Anyway, in ""Alien"" a group of somewhat unlikely ""space truckers,"" trying to get a cargo ship named Nostromo full of ore to its destination, encounter a terrifying new life form that bleeds metal-melting acid and boasts elongated limbs and features as well as a prehensile tail, not to mention multiple mouths with rows of razor-sharp teeth, ultimately adding up to a formidable foe indeed. Now, for the SPOILERS: The alien displays quite a tenacious will to survive, and eventually runs through the majority of the crew like a knife through butter. And both the most clever and equally tenacious crew member, Ripley, exclusively becomes the sole survivor of the Nostromo.It doesn't erase the extreme levels of worry and dread of the previous two hours, but that's something, isn't it? 😱","

The sound and special effects is so well done, very translucent legendary classic like nothing else. So nice to see all the young actors in their prime. The look of Alien and drool was so perfect; I am so grateful to have been able to experience it on the big screen, sorry if I overly talk about that although I did get my ticket in August so I was ready.

"Alien","KoolCatReviews","6 April 2020","This isn't just an 'alien' film this is the alien film. A film that succeeds in both the horror and Sci-fi genre. Having seen both versions of this film directors and the theatrical, I must tell you to watch this film. The acting cast is great, the story flows and is logical but that's not even the best part. The special effects and CGI have never really been topped by any other film. Even in the newer 'alien' movies or the 'alien vs predator' franshise. Nothing has created true horror in the 'alien' universe such as this. A classic most people would call it, after all it is the alien movie.","

"Alien","sharky_55","17 April 2016","The opening of Alien recalls another sci-fi masterpiece, 2001 with its slow, labourious long takes that elegantly reveal its world (there's even a deleted Spaceballs-style shot where the gigantic Nostromo rolls over the top of the screen). Scott takes his time to introduce us to little bits of information as we need them - which is why the eventual reveal of Ash as an android is so effective. The assumed knowledge that with space travel comes advanced robotics has us second guessing every move even halfway through the movie. The camera-work is cautious in peering around each dim corner and ledge, as if it was a crew member in itself fearful for its own life. Modern horrors are always rushing to the next gory spectacle, the next money shot. Alien wants to milk every last drop of suspense of the universe's great unknown before it eats you up. The action subscribes to the notion of less is more. The dark shadows of the ship hide the alien from plain sight - an organic evil shifting in and out of tech that for all its advancements is a futile barrier (it becomes a dripping, primordial environment, perfect for fostering life). This is foreshadowed by the way the acid makes it way through several layers of the ship. The actors react to what they see - the shock of a sudden movement or a shocking clue is not overloading by the soundtrack like so many conventional horror movies do. We are shown what we need to see - a glimpse of a tail coiling out of thee darkness, a blip on the monitor gaining on a helpless member, static on the screen - and then the deepest parts of our imagination fill in the gaps. For the more explicit areas the effects are still excellent. One will never forget the first slow crane-up reveal of the gigantic alien pilot chair (I've always referred to this as the dentist chair) - a lifeless shell, but imposing nonetheless. There's a chilling sense of life within the alien baby, the way it abruptly breaches the boundaries of the spacesuit and coils around Kane's neck a little tighter when they try to remove it. A simple little premise renders their weapons useless - they are foolish to think they can capture it with a net and cattle prod, but it soon becomes a nightmare. The bursting of the chest - a bloody, visceral image that has become iconic because of the way it shocks and violates everything the crew thinks and knows of their safety and regulations. Ash's internal organs, a similarly grotesque sight, matched by his chilling mockery of humankind's chances - only a robot would be so gleeful and admirative of the perfect, remorseless organism gaining its survival by cutting down other living things (Asimov's rules come into play here). Much has been made of the clear phallic symbolism - the spitting second mouth like a jutting penis, the vaginal walls pulsating and dripping with life, the impregnation of Kane as a vessel. It does not fully reconcile the act of stripping at the end for me. Weaver was young and pretty enough to be considered a sex symbol and the skimpy display here reduces her to a basic horror archetype - the vulnerable, sexy girl, the last one to be picked off. But it is only a minor grievance - Ripley is established as being clearly the one with the most sense and brains, and the studio obviously had faith in her by keeping her alive for potential sequels. Decades on this is still a remarkable sci-fi horror achievement.","

"Alien","Red_Identity","19 March 2012","Believe it or not, I had never seen an Alien film. What prompted me to actually see it was the fantastic Prometheus trailer that debuted. Even if the film turns out to suck (which I really doubt) it would still have been worth it to watch the original Alien.What can I say? Fantastic. The music, the slow-paced nature of the first half, together with increasing tension as the film goes along is incredible. Once stuff hits the fan, it never lets you go. The film is also quite scary, an it made me jump various times. Why? It knows how to build tension incredibly, and the final 20 minutes are truly perfection. Both the sound and visual effects work to make the film a very effective experience, as does the wonderful cinematography. Bring on the Aliens, bitch!","

"Alien","TheLittleSongbird","11 January 2011","Easily one of Ridley Scott's finest films, and one of the best of the sci-fi genre. Alien is simply wonderful, with imaginative production design especially and a magnificent score from Jerry Goldsmith. The pace is also right on the money with a purposefully slow build-up, the editing is great, Scott's direction is superb and the story is wonderfully structured with seldom a dull moment. The script is also thought-provoking, clever and well written, while the atmosphere is just spellbinding with a perfect mixture of false scares and genuine jolts. The acting is also top notch, Sigourney Weaver is amazing as Ellen Ripley, who is not only one of the most iconic characters in film history but a contender for Weaver's best ever role. It is a delight seeing fine underrated actor John Hurt, and he is great to watch as the curious crewman. Overall, defines the term sci-fi classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox","

"Alien","Leofwine_draca","17 March 2015","There's no doubt that ALIEN is a classic of the science fiction genre. It's a film that came along at just the right time, proving to be an antidote to the kind of kiddie-friendly sci-fi that was popularised by STAR WARS during the period. While this first film in the long-running series has since been overshadowed by a superior sequel (Jim Cameron's ALIENS, one of the best sci fi/horror/action films ever) and a third film that nearly equalled the highs found here, it's nevertheless a hugely entertaining movie that works thanks to a simple, straightforward plot line that offers maximum terror, all of the time.One thing it isn't is original. The likes of this go back to the 1950s and earlier. Essentially it's one of those 'old dark house' films of the '30s, transferred to a futuristic spaceship. One film, a '50s B-movie - IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE - has almost exactly the same plot as this film, while Mario Bava's sci-fi outing PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES has the same visual look. Yet ALIEN isn't about originality, just old-fashioned scares executed in a clean, professional manner. This is a film of shadowy corners and dark spaces, of menaces and monsters lurking in air ducts, ready to kill and do worse to you at a moment's notice. It's still terrifying to this day, and the atmosphere is helped no end by an effective soundtrack that includes a beating human heart to up the tension.Technical qualities are superior and the cast is great. There's a pleasing tendency to kill off random actors regardless of their status which means you can't second-guess who's going to bite it next. Stand-outs include Sigourney Weaver, transforming here from a faceless crew member to a tough heroine, a remarkable progression that carried on into the sequels. Tom Skerritt is perfectly cast as the good-natured captain while Yaphet Kotto steals the show as the hard guy engineer. In fact, all of the cast give excellent turns and a role for Ian Holm early on in his career is a real standout.Another plus is the scary, sexual design of the alien stuff by H. R. Giger. The facehugger is the stuff of nightmares while the alien itself is probably the pinnacle of man-in-a-rubber-suit technology; there's certainly been nothing scarier than the creature you'll see here. Great pacing, excellent effects, and an underlining realism combine to make ALIEN a genre classic and a film that's been rarely touched by the rip-offs that followed. One for the collection.","

"Alien","dworldeater","26 November 2021","Alien is Ridley Scott's masterpiece. This kicked off a mostly excellent franchise and influenced cinema as whole. Designed with great detail by brilliant artist HR Geiger the Alien brings forth a new level of intergalactic terror. Alien is completely different from anything that came before and took sci fi horror to new heights and gave it a lot of depth. The ensemble cast is excellent and is lead by Sigorney Weaver and had Yaphett Kotto, Tom Skerrit and Harry Dean Stanton as strong support. In my opinion this film is flawless and still looks incredible today. The special effects are amazing and the acting and direction is spot on. Alien is incredible and in my opinion is timeless. The film aged well and is essential and a classic.","

"Alien","bowmanblue","28 September 2014","I'm writing this review not because I think 'Alien' needs another 5* review, but because I read a post on an internet message board by someone saying, 'I can't believe this piece of junk is considered scary!' So, I re-watched Alien, trying to see if I could see where this poster was coming from. I guess there are now two types of viewers. The first - like me - grew up on Alien in the late seventies/early eighties, where it was one of the most ahead of its time films ever made. It started off the whole 'monster-munching' movie genre, where a lone creature stalks and eliminates a team/crew/whatever one by one. There have been countless B-movies made since its release in 1979 which have tried - unsuccessfully - recapture its look, feel and financial viability, but pretty much all have failed.Then you have the new generation - those who have grown up with 'Avatar' as the 'normal' quality of film. It's fair to say that Avatar is a vastly superior film to Alien, but only because it has the budget etc. If you're used to seeing thousands of alien creatures fighting over a mystical landscape, watching a single creature (which, as some times, comes across very much as a bloke in a suit) jump out of the darkness about five times in two hours, comes as a bit of a let-down.However, when it comes to purity, Alien will beat pretty much every movie ever made (even its highly-regarded successor, 'Aliens,' which - although also excellent, is not as pure as the original, as it blends genres more).If you know Alien and generally appreciate horror and/or science-fiction, you'll probably already love it. However, if you're new to the genre and primarily are used to modern filming techniques, you may have to put yourself in the place of the audiences back in 1979, who had never seen such a claustrophobic and tense piece of horror.The xenomorph itself, now looking a little dated (in my opinion the dragon-thing at the end of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland looked more horrific!) may not cut it compared with modern special effects, but - again - it was way ahead of its time. Alien will stand the test of (cinematic) time. Film history will always have a place of it (and Aliens), just don't go thinking that films have always been made the way Avatar and Lord of the Rings have.","

"Alien","acdc_mp3","8 February 2022","I have seen this movie countless times since 1979 and it still delivers on the aspect of being far from earth, on a planet you do not know, with a spaceship of unknown origin, and encountering a nasty lifeform. These people were blue collar workers; not the brilliant scientists and doctors that you see in today's movies regarding aliens. No, what you see in 1979 is much more realistic of how humans would be when encountering a complete unknown. In movies like Prometheus and Life, the overall common sense is nil and the smarmy, charming and very attractive geniuses are completely opposite of what brilliant people of science and medicine are really like. In reality, they are mostly awkward, quiet, strange and in many times extremely plain in appearance. In Alien, everyone comes across as tired, annoyed, curious (Kane) and finally terrified. A very real progression that leads to the outcome.Most of the bad reviews I have read on IMDB come from viewers who have grown up on the CGI oatmeal that most movies rely on instead of story. It's sad that they don't realize how great the story of Alien is.The cast back in 1979 was mostly unknowns which added so much to the reality and everyone played their parts perfectly.I am watching the movie right now as I write this and even though I know exactly what is going to happen, I am still tense and in awe of how good it still is.If you do not like this movie, I pity you.","

"Alien","PredragReviews","20 April 2016","""Alien"" is one of the most intense Sci-Fi thrillers to have ever graced the silver screen or the home theater in any format! It is the film's intensity that provides such an incredible draw to this extraordinary film. I was pulled in by the ultra high sense of realism. This film almost feels like a documentary because of a lot of the subtle hand-held camera work (read; not like the shaky, seizure inducing hand-held work of today's films). There's much going on in that film that was revolutionary for the time. Great ideas, design, cinematography, subtle, very realistic performances.Sigourney Weaver stars as Ellen Ripley in her film debut role. Weaver is absolutely perfect for the role, and was practically the first girl-power type female heroine who single-handedly carries this international blockbuster right through until the final minutes. John Hurt also plays Kane to excellent effect, especially in his death scene as he frantically wriggles on the table with the alien inside him. Harry Dean Stanton is brilliant as Brett, as is Tom Skerritt as Dallas. Yaphet Kotto is also perfectly cast as Parker, who provides many on-screen laughs. Veronica Kartwright (who later went on to star in The X-Files some 20 years later) stars as the lovable Lambert, the only other female member of the crew along with Ripley. Ian Holm as Ash is absolutely brilliant in his role as the android secretly sent on board to bring back the alien life- form, while - in his eyes, and ""Mother's"" - all other crew members are expendable. The acting in this film is really first-rate, which is another big factor in why the film works so well.The art designs are incredible: the entire look of the film, from the commercial nature of the spacecraft to the iconographic alien itself is right on the money. It amazes me how well visually this movie still holds up. It feels as rich and deep cinematically as most anything today due to Ridley Scott's brilliant visuals. You watch this film at certain points and it feels as slick and polished as any current genre film without the hollowness or incompetence. All in all, Alien is a terrific sci-fi horror movie that plays with your senses incredibly well. Nothing happens for the first 30 minutes, and that is exactly the director's intent. By doing so, a feeling of extreme suspense is instantly formed, leaving you on the edge of your seat until the very end.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.","

"Alien","851222","22 October 2014","Greetings from Lithuania.""Alien"" (1979) is a masterpiece, pure and simple. If there is still anyone who somehow haven't seen it (i can't imagine how could that be even possible), do your self a favor a watch it, not with your friends on Friday evening, but alone and let this movie blow you away. I saw this picture for 5-7 times in my life, and the last time i did (actualy today), was on my 2m x 2m screen projector with all sound system ready to roll. This is timeless film because of many things. The atmosphere, the rising tension, the craftsmanship of the scenes, acting - it all works here because they are not overplayed, and build on seemingly simple approach. 15 minutes into this movie again i caught myself that i forgot everything and i was in there, with them. Thats because of the script, directing, acting - it's all in the first place here, not settings, which still looks great - a bit dated, maybe, but it's not Star Wars type movie were visuals have to be sharp - ""Alien"" shows things in shadows, moody style to create feeling of uncertainty, and it does it brilliantly - that is why this movie is never going to age. Please don't ever compare it to even superior (in my opinion) ""Aliens"" - ""Alien"" is different kind of a movie, it's purpose was to scare people with deadly and very claustrophobic atmosphere, settings and the creature itself, to feel people uncomfortable (in a good way) knowing that no one is safe here and around every corner there could be your end - just look at the close ups near the end of the movie, or shoots where camera is showing person and a deep dark space behind him, thats were imagination starts to fill the darkness.Overall, 10/10 for one of the greatest achievements in the art of movie making.","

"Alien","nickenchuggets","24 June 2022","Every so often, a movie so influential is released that it changes an entire genre. While it might look a little dated by today's standards, I would still say Alien falls into this category. Even after 50 years, I've seen few movies that manage to make you feel as alone and helpless as this one. This has a lot to do with the setting, which is probably the best thing about the film. Space is full of wonders and exotic sights, some of which haven't even been discovered yet, but it can also be your worst nightmare, especially for those that are claustrophobic. This is because almost this entire movie takes place on a spaceship so far away from Earth that it would take months to get back to the planet. The spaceship in question is the USCSS Nostromo, which is attached to a large ore refinery. The ship is run by an advanced artificial intelligence with female programming, known as Mother. The crew of the ship consists of a measly 7 people, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Kane (John Hurt), Captain Dallas, Parker, Lambert, Ash and Brett. They've been awakened from a type of suspended animation procedure designed to preserve a person's lifespan on unimaginably long space journeys because the ship has detected something on a local moon. The unknown signal appears as a pulse on the radar screen that blinks every 12 seconds, and the crew has no idea what it is. Ripley has a bad feeling about what the signal could be and suggests they leave it alone and get out of there. However, the Nostromo's parent company dictates that any unknown signal has to be investigated. The ship uncouples itself from the refinery and begins to land on the moon. Once there, 3 crew members, including Kane, venture outside the ship in order to find the source of the signal, and find out it's originating from a huge, crashed alien craft shaped like a wishbone. Once inside, the 3 crewmembers discover a massive, circular command center which has the fossilized remains of the ship's pilot sitting on a chair. More concerning is the fact that the body has a large gouge in its chest, like something exploded from inside it. Upon going deeper into the ship, Kane comes across what looks to be a cargo hold containing dozens of round, leathery objects, each about 2 feet tall. Not knowing what they are, he tries to investigate one, when a creature resembling a horseshoe crab with tentacles grabs onto his face. Some time after, the remaining crewmembers carry the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo, and even though it seems like a cruel thing to do, Ripley refuses them entry, worried about the potentially deadly thing attached to him. However, Dallas outranks Ripley and overturns her decision. Once Kane is onboard again, Ash, the ship's scientist, and Dallas set about trying to remove the strange lifeform from his face. They try cutting it, but it bleeds corrosive liquid that burns through several layers of the ship's hull. They also find out it inserted something down his throat and is supplying him oxygen, so removing it forcefully might kill him. Eventually, it dies and falls off on its own, and Kane appears to be alright, despite having no memory of what happened to him. After a while though, the crew's mealtime is interrupted when Kane suffers a horribly gory death by having a juvenile alien tear itself through his midsection. As it turns out, the creature attached to him implanted the egg of an alien into his body, and now it's prowling around the ship somewhere. The crewmembers try different ways of killing it, including electric pikes and flamethrowers. The alien effortlessly kills any person trying to track it down, and not much time passes before it's bigger than a human. After Brett and Dallas are killed trying to look for it, someone suggests abandoning the ship, but the Nostromo's shuttle is too small to ferry the 4 survivors. Later on, Ripley finds out via Mother that Ash actually admires the alien as the ""perfect lifeform"" and his goal is to make sure no harm comes to it. Ash's cover is blown, and after trying to kill Ripley, he is decapitated and shown to be a robot. Ash's disembodied head tells the survivors that his true mission was always the safekeeping of the creature, and he doesn't care if the rest of the crew dies. Ash's body is destroyed with a flamethrower, and the remaining 3 decide it's time to blow up the ship. Ripley tells Lambert and Parker to get as much coolant as possible, but the alien sneaks up on them and kills them both. Meanwhile, Ripley initiates the ship's self destruct countdown, and after a certain amount of time has passed, there's no aborting it. Now completely alone, she manages to get to the shuttle about 20 seconds before the Nostromo blows up. It looks like she's finally won, but the alien has actually snuck onto the shuttle with her. After hiding from it for what seems like an eternity, she shoots it into the airlock after opening it, and the shuttle's exhaust disintegrates it. Finally, Ripley is able to safely return to cryosleep for the long journey to earth. This is without a doubt one of the most well known horror movies ever, and it's easy to see why. There's, of course, many reasons to praise Alien for, and alien is the keyword here. The movie features a lot of creepy and otherworldly visual design courtesy of HR Giger, who also designed the appearance of the title character. Nothing else in sci-fi looks like it, and this art style is present all through the movie, including the architecture of the crashed ship. One of Alien's core advantages is how well the movie is able to create tension. There's many moments throughout where you sense something bad will happen, and something suddenly appears, but it's not the alien. Once the feeling of relief comes over you, that's when it strikes. Obviously I can't talk about suspense without mentioning the movie's stellar soundtrack. It does what it's supposed to do, and makes those moments of anticipation all that much creepier. Still, I think the best thing about this movie is simply the fact that it takes place in a disturbing environment. It's similar to Jaws but with a space setting, and creates a feeling of unease knowing you're lightyears away from humanity and nobody can hear you. It's not like this is an original opinion, but I think Alien has definitely earned its place as one of horror's all time best, due to its setting, relatable characters, unforgettable art design, music, and countless other things.","

"Alien","ContagiousLasagna","21 September 2018","What makes Alien great is it's synchronization of sound, visuals and showing great attention to detail. Not only that but Alien has an unnerving atmosphere right from the beginning. We're introduced to a crew who is not exactly too friendly to each other add to that the ship. It's huge, and with its halls and corridors, it feels almost like a maze.Enter Alien, a ruthless parasite with humanoid form yet it lacks any civilised traits of a human. It does have humanoid form but it doesn't give a single emotion. The design of the monster is what's the most terrifying (and it still holds up despite Alien being released in 1979). The creature is also better adapted to the ship's interior making a big part of the movie feel like a sinister game of cat and mouse.What I particularly like is how the characters are written. They are not Hollywoodized heroes, in fact, there is no hero. They're just people which makes them even more threatened. The performances are all equally realistic and do deliver. Kudos to director Ridley Scott for using crafty cinematography and combining it with shadows and lights in an eerie way. The music is unrelenting and combined with Scott's cinematography, sound and visuals it adds to the eeriness.The plot is also not another Hollywoodized cliché. It's more like ""survival of the fittest"". The characters battle true terror as they race to survive or outlive each other, they're all just a part of a race to see who will prevail and who will die.Final Rating: 10/10","

"Alien","truemythmedia","24 June 2019","The settings in this film are exhilarating and claustrophobic, the characters are funny and likeable and we want them to survive, the creature is horrifying and vile, and the storyline is tense and exciting. This might be the most popular alien franchise ever made (there are more sequels for this than there are for ""Predator""), and that's a well-deserved title. Personally, this is in my top ten science fiction films (and maybe in my top ten horror films as well); it's a movie I'll return to multiple times over the course of my life, and its one I doubt I'll ever grow tired.

"Alien","hitchcockthelegend","12 May 2019","Alien is directed by Ridley Scott and written by Ronald Shusett and Dan O'Bannon. It stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, John Hurt, Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm and Harry Dean Stanton. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Derek Vanlint.The space merchant vessel Nostromo receives an unknown transmission as a distress call and land on the moon where the call had come from. Bad idea...Back on release it was one of the most talked about movies of 1979, backed by a terrifically tantalising trailer - which itself was backed by one of the greatest tag-lines of them all, the weight of expectation of a genre blending classic was colossal. This was only after all director Ridley Scott's second feature length film, could a sophomore pic really be all that? History as we now know has proven that to be the case.On plot synopsis it's standard format, where the haunted house and a killer on the loose has been replaced by a space ship in space. Yet once the pic plays its alien hand, and it becomes a battle of survival in one location, it dawns on you there is really no escape. No running into the garden and down the street, no hiding in the attic hoping the killer saunters off home, this is find and destroy or be destroyed yourself - with the future of mankind depending on the humans to succeed.Some still go into a viewing of Alien nowadays and decry it for being too much of a slow burn, yet this is one of the pic's biggest assets. Time in space is slow anyway, and lonely one would guess, so Scott wisely lets the characters be introduced, lets us understand just enough about their psychological make up before things go belly up (literally as it happens). When the pot finally boils over it's terrifying, the bar well and truly raised for horror/sci-fi hybrid conventions.With art design by H.R. Giger and Goldsmith producing eerie musical rumbles, the whole piece has a disquiet about it, notably with distressing sexual connotations and symbolism that haunts the mind as the body horror unfolds. The quiet passages are nerve shredders, Alien across the board is a visceral experience, especially for those who have ever watched it on a big screen in a darkened theatre.It made a star of Weaver, who unbeknown to those on first viewing is the main character, another masterstroke by Scott, with Ripley the character in Weaver's hands shunting women's character's in big budget films forward by some considerable margin. All the cast are on great form, there's no showy stars in here, a collection of hard working British and American actors feeding off their director for super returns.Now 40 years old, Alien shows no sign of losing its classic status, and rightly so. A seminal class act that still holds all the qualities it had back in 1979. In space no one can hear you scream - indeed! 10/10","

"Alien","oneshotstop","20 July 1999","Director Ridley Scott's well-honed talents of pacing and editing create a tense atmosphere that superbly conveys dread and fear of an unknown, unseen evil entity.  In 1979, the technology didn't exist to generate a computer image of a Being from another world, and thank God, because this film would have sucked just like all these post-Alien creature features do.  Everyone who loves this movie knows what I'm talking about.  Ridley Scott had to be extremely careful not to show a full shot of the Alien, except in very brief scenes, and not to reveal exactly how it moves, because then we would see that it is just some tall, skinny guy in a rubber suit.  Nowadays, some computer guy would whip up a really scary-looking, but nevertheless FAKE-looking (yes, computer guys, we can tell) Alien, and the director would not have to even think about trying to breathe life into H.R. Giger's hallucinations to make a successful picture.The dark, cold beauty of this film will never be equaled.","

"Alien","funkyfry","22 August 2006","This is one of the few sci-fi horror films from the period of the late 70s/early 80s that has really held up with time.On a visual level, the film is highly satisfying. Green and light blue colors are saturated throughout the film, but so grayed that the movie almost appears at many points to be shot in black and white. The miniatures and matte effects used in the original film were quite good.The movie works on pretty much every level, though you can't really say it's an incredible story either. On a sci-fi level, the best parts are the early parts where we first see the alien technology. I was disappointed actually in the print that I saw because I believe it was altered with computers, I remember seeing more matte screens that resembled the HR Geiger artwork when the film was on video. Anyway, the alien technology succeeds on a level never before achieved in terms of showing a realistic alien culture. We can almost imagine these creatures living on this ship, it seems to fit in with the alien biology so well.When they arrive back on their own ship, the film unfortunately descends into a fairly typical horror action film. Perhaps taking a note from Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", Scott kills off the only reasonably well known actor in the film (at the time of its release), Tom Skerrit, fairly quickly and leaves us with the then-unknown Weaver as the hero. This makes her the first really butt-kicking female heroine of a sci-fi action film, and that alone qualifies this film as groundbreaking.The cast in general is just amazing. Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm, John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton -- these are quite simply some of the best character actors of their generation, all gathered for the purpose of making this more than just a typical monster movie. Other films such as ""Predator"" tried but failed to get a supporting cast as distinguished and talented as this one gathered for a sci-fi action film. The quality of these actors makes the film better not only in the individual scenes they are in (such as Holm's incredible turn once exposed), but also the aggregate total of the film -- because the actors are so good and the characters relatively fleshed out, we can imagine right up until the film's final moments that any one of them could be the one who ends up surviving.Another interesting element not often commented on is the cynical attitude the astronauts have towards ""the company"", which employs them. From Kotto and Stanton's character's complaints about the hours, all the way up to Weaver's discovery that all of them were expendable and kept in the dark as to the true purpose of their mission (which Skerrit's character seems to also know more about than Weaver's), there is a kind of dark realism here that you won't find in the vast majority of films of this type. It dovetails with the other element I've talked about, the fact that the cast is so good that any one of them could be the ""hero"" -- this is a very democratic look at the future, one edged with deep cynicism but with an ultimate eye towards presenting a future of real people who are oppressed by situations far beyond their control. It is a far cry from the Utopian dreams of Heinlein and other sci-fi progenitors and represents this film's true gift to science fiction as a whole.","

"Alien","willwoodmill","14 February 2016","Alien is one indisputably one of the best science fiction, and horror films ever made. And easily one of the most influential ever. As it basically invented and defined the science- fiction horror genre, paving the way for films like the thing, and predator. One of Alien's best aspects is its amazing cinematography and creature/set design. All of see work together to give the film a visual style that was unlike anything scene at the time and Ridley Scott would re-use in Blade Runner. Alien's magnificent visuals can be strangely credited to Alejandro Jodorowsky, who found and assembled all the different artists used in Alien for his adaptation of the novel dune, which was unfortunately canned before shooting started, but every cloud has a silver lining, and Jodorowsky's Dune's silver lining was Alien. Another one of Alien's best aspects is its pacing and atmosphere, though some people today may call Alien ""boring,"" these people know nothing about film and are not to be trusted. Alien opens with a slow footage of space, as the eerie score plays, open credits come up, and the title is slowly spelled out, this is then followed by a slow montage of the empty ship Nostromo, followed by the crew slowly waking up from cryospleep. In fact we don't see any sign of an alien until 1/3 of the way through the film, and we don't see the main alien until halfway through the film. And this is why some call it ""boring,"" but these people came to see the wrong film, they expected something like predator, a straight forward action film where the hero tries to kill the creature, instead what they got was something more like Halloween or Psycho, a subtle unnerving film that builds tension and doesn't blow its load all at once.The characters in Alien are also far above the average horror movie, they aren't annoying teenagers, or people that we just want to see die. They're relatable diverse logical characters, that have really natural chemistry, as can be seen in some of the films earlier scenes. And another interesting thing about the characters is, we have to figure out which one the protagonist is, it isn't revealed immediately and makes all lot of scenes much more tense because we don't know which characters are going to die. Though Alien begins slow, the final scenes of Alien are some of the most ""on the edge of your seat"" scenes ever, I don't won't to spoil anything for anyone who somehow hasn't scene alien yet, but you will most likely be on the verge of a heart attack while watching.One final note, I recommend you watch the original version first, and then you most definitely should watch the directors cut.9.6/10","

"Alien","classicsoncall","28 January 2009","For me, ""Alien"" was one of the seminal films of the Seventies that had a way of reinventing a genre, much in the way ""Star Wars"" did for sci-fi fantasy or ""The Exorcist"" did for horror. Sci-fi horror was treated to something new and different here, with scenes and concepts that were truly unique that hadn't been done before. I still think back to the time I saw the picture during it's original theatrical release, and marvel at the idea of the chest-burster for example. And I can't tell you how much the scene with Ash (Ian Holm) that revealed his robotic form blew me completely away; it was almost too difficult to concentrate on the rest of the story. Then there was the title character itself, a creature assuming horrific proportions through the same process of metamorphosis that transforms caterpillars into butterflies, but here done with complete disregard for the norms of natural evolutionary process.What's striking in watching the film today is how both timely and timeless it is. Timely in that as a product of the Seventies, the set design seems almost minimalist, to the degree that sci-fi films of the 1940's and '50's were dated to reflect the technology of those periods. Timeless however in the constructs that work to achieve their intended effect in the mind of the viewer, a fear of the unknown and a fascination with fantastical creatures that have a right to exist only in our imagination. Something as simple as Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) picking up the reptilian shed skin of the chest burster claws away at one's mind, forcing the viewer to consider what might be in store for the survivors of this mission. Speaking of which, I haven't seen any comments on the role of the spaceship on this board. There was a point in the movie when it began to emerge that the Nostromo itself became a hostile entity to the crew. 'Mother' herself appeared to have, in the words of many a 'Star Trek' episode, a prime directive of it's own, that of investigating and securing alien life forms. Was there a more chilling moment in the story than the words Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) read as Mother's response to her question about the nature of of Nostromo's programming? - ""Crew Expendable"". So it's thirty years since the release of ""Alien"", and the film is just as fascinating to watch today as it was that long ago. Granted, some of the early going is a bit slow in the delivery, but as a set up to what follows it's a wait that's made worthwhile for the suspense that builds and reaches a crescendo in the second half. I'll take this one head and shoulders over any number of present day efforts that attempt to dazzle the audience with over the top action and mind blowing special effects, each successive effort attempting to outdo the one that came before. With ""Alien"" you have the real deal, a story and a creation that stands the test of time to emerge as an icon of popular movie and cultural entertainment.","

"Alien","mockexamcritique","27 August 2022","1979... crazy. Looks better than modern movies. Great artwork the alien. The original Alien was something special. Ridley Scott was a master of suspense in that film, and it is also very uncomfortable in 2022. The crew facing this creature alone in space is a simple but very effective film. I love the fact that Ripley is just another character in the film and that she is forced to play the lead role when people are killed. Not heroin. Heroine, full stop. The fact that Ellen Ripley is a woman doesn't affect her level of badassery at all, although it does affect her character in ways that make her far more interesting than any other cinematic hero. She's complicated, she's real, and I'm absolutely certain that the Alien films wouldn't have become classics without her.In particular compared to modern movies this is a great female lead. Overall just a great classic.","

"Alien","mstomaso","8 June 2007","While there is a general resemblance to the classic pulp sci fi film, ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space"", Alien is an expertly crafted and thoroughly original film. In my opinion, it is also vastly superior to all of its descendants, including James Cameron's action and special effects smorgasbord, Aliens.As a teenager, I was so intrigued by the premise of this movie that I was one of the few people in the United States who went out and purchased Alan Dean Foster's book ""Alien"" and read it before the film was released. The book was actually very good, so I knew I was either in for a big treat or a total disappointment when I went to see Ridley Scott's Alien on opening night. Of course, there was no disappointment.Scott assembled a great cast, none of whom (at the time) had a great deal of face recognition except, perhaps, Ian Holm. He placed his characters in stasis aboard a long distance freight ship (""the Nostromo"") owned and operated by a mining company. The ship is grimy, a little broken down, and a bit cramped. The habitat module is one very small portion of this enormous commercial barge.The film uses sound beautifully. Both the amazingly haunting and memorable postmodern soundtrack and excellent soundscape are flawless. The film opens with the ship's computer beginning to power on the ship's systems, and even though the scene consists of nothing but sound effects and mostly immobile hardware, it is permanently burned into my memory.The crew is awakened, and unlike most sci fi films, almost immediately begins complaining about being brought out of stasis early and bickering about how much they should be paid for what appears to be an extra duty. Soon, we learn that a communication signal has been picked up on a planet nearby and the Nostromo's shuttle must descend to the planet and investigate.All of this is established effortlessly by Scott's fantastic directing, cinematography and editing, but rather than spoiling any aspect of this brilliantly plotted and presented story, I will discontinue my plot summary here and move on to the critique.Ridley Scott has directed two of the best science fiction films of all time - Bladerunner and Alien. These two films are completely different and also radically innovative for the sci fi genre. Alien reintroduces realism the the genre. The crew is not a bunch of heroic freedom fighters or righteous warriors. Instead, they are corporate staff members and a couple of administrators - a captain (Skerrit) and first officer (Weaver) who are the company management representatives, mechanics, a science officer/ship's surgeon, a navigator, and geologists (it's a mining company). The ship itself is not a sterile faster-than-light Maserati in space, but a gritty, messy, cramped, barge. And the alien is TRULY ALIEN. 'nuff said about him.H.R. Giger's organic/cybernetic art enhances the other-worldliness of all of the scenes that take place off of the Nostromo, and of course, the design of the alien itself. An enormous contribution that should not be overlooked.It doesn't really matter which version of this film you see. They are all terrific. The director's cut adds a couple of scenes which appeared in the book, but were left out of the original release. Personally, I don't think these scenes really add much to the film, but it is a matter of personal taste, since all of the versions I have seen are 10s.Recommended for anybody who can tolerate sci-fi.","

From the long, detailed shots of both interior and exterior of the ship, to the fleeting glimpses of the alien, this is cinematography at it's best.

"Alien","the50xbomb","1 September 2022","One of the best lit films of all time, the attention and care towards how the sets, actors, and Xenomorph appear in darkness and light is so commendable and is what keeps this film looking so fresh. Alien is basically what happens when a creative team is given the ability to build an immersive world while also making a tense horror movie about an alien killing people on a ship. It has indulgent landing and launching sequences, an infatuation with the anatomy of its creature, accurate specs of its ships layout, it's not a hard sci-fi watch per se but you can tell if Ridley and the crew had more money this film would probably be much longer. As it is I think it has the perfect length, also huge props to that fantastic cast where every character is clear and well motivated. I love this movie so much.","

"Alien","chucksteel","26 December 2022","My friend and I saw Alien when it was first released, at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood. We were teenagers in high school. We sat in the front row. After Star Wars had come out 2 years previously, we were still waiting for something else equally comparable to come along. With this, we finally got what we had been waiting for. Not only was it a great science fiction movie, it was also one of the greatest horror movies.I went in to this knowing next to nothing what it was about. All I had to go on was the line in the poster: ""In space, no one can hear you scream."" I just had to find out what it was that was gonna make us scream. I found out all right! They came up with quite a terrifying alien monster. This was the kind of thing, once the crew of the Nostromo started to learn its true nature, during the course of watching the movie, it was chilling to think they might not be prepared to stop it.Now, decades later I regard this as one of the greatest science fiction movies, and also one of the greatest horror movies. If you are a fan of either genre, or especially both, you need to check this one out. And don't stop at this - there is a whole fictional universe that has been created, the Alien and Predator movies, many of which are worth your while.","

"Alien","xiaoli7377","15 December 2022","""Alien"" is the one of the first films that I think of when I think of the word ""atmosphere."" Ridley Scott brilliantly crafts a setting in this sci-fi horror classic that is still explored with prequels and sequels. It's not just the setting though; it's the way that the plot slowly builds up and there are many moments of downtime to get a little familiar with characters. This film, along with other late 70s classics such as ""Halloween"", really set up the blueprint that most modern horror films replicate.This movie is a marvel on a photographic level, with much of the shot composition and lighting and set design really making for a dark and claustrophobic experience. The idea of a huge 7 foot tall monster with acidic blood and a retractable mouth-within-a-mouth that hunts the crew members off one by one is a horrifying thought.Much props has to be given to Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. This was a breakout role for her, and it's a role that she further explores and brings even more perfection to in the sequel. Most of the other characters aren't really worth mentioning other than Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) who I found extremely obnoxious and annoying (I can tell that this was probably Ridley Scott's intent with the character though). I also really liked Yaphet Lotto's character, Parker. No nonsense.This is a must watch. Many classic horror movie tropes were spawned from this one. And with decades past it's still extremely elusive to track down, much like its eponymous alien.","

"Alien","VikingBurialService","15 September 2022","Still a move I love. I wouldn't call Alien a 10/10, but it's about as close as a movie can come. The only better sci-fi horror I can think of is John Carpenter's The Thing. The dialogue here is perfect, the acting is perfect, the set and music perfectly play into the horror theme. I think the one reason this movie doesn't strike any special chord with me is that it feels slow to start with, and some of the actual scenes of the aliens itself haven't aged perfectly (it's obvious that it's someone in a suit, though not as bad as some of the 50s/60s creature features). Other than that, this is the pinnacle of sci-fi horror. A highlight is the setting/atmosphere - something about the grimy interior of the nostromo makes it one of the most memorable setting for any movie ever.","

"Alien","Gafke","14 January 2006","Commercial star ship Nostromo, returning from a routine mission, are detoured when an alien SOS is intercepted. Awakened from hypersleep, the crew are obligated to land on the alien world where the call for help has originated, but the ship is slightly damaged during the landing process and three of the crew set out to explore the hostile new world. They come upon a derelict spacecraft, the skeletonized remains of an alien creature with an odd wound in its chest and a cache of strange egg-like objects. Crew member Kane is brought back from the exploration unconscious and with a bizarre, crab-like creature attached to his face. He is still alive, and indeed, the creature on his face seems to be keeping him alive for reasons unknown. The Nostromo is repaired and the crew leave the desolate planet behind. The crab creature soon leaves its perch on Kane's face and dies, and Kane emerges from his coma, apparently in good health. But the purpose of the alien soon becomes terribly clear; Kane has been impregnated with an alien embryo which births itself from his chest in a shower of blood and gore, killing Kane and escaping into the ships air ducts before anyone can react. The crew set out to destroy the creature, not realizing immediately that its accelerated growth has transformed it into a huge and vicious predator whose only desire is to kill them all.Very loosely based upon the 1958 horror film ""IT! The Terror From Beyond Space"" Alien is a masterpiece of Gothic horror, a haunted house movie on a spaceship. Flawlessly directed by Ridley Scott, Alien, whose plot is actually fairly simplistic and nothing new, is so filled with dread, so claustrophobically genuine, that it seems like nothing ever seen before. Ghostly steam, clinking chains, long dark corridors where anything can be hiding, the suspense is unbelievably suffocating. We never really get to see what the alien actually looks like until films end, and so the quick flashes of tail, head and mouth are so brief and so confusing that it only adds to the horror. Plus, Alien does what no ghost story can do - there is no way out of this ""haunted house."" There is no escape from the horror within.The performances are all outstanding. The alien is not the only menace to the all-too human crew; there are also soulless corporations and short circuiting androids to be dealt with on top of everything else. Faced with these dilemmas, every single crew member of the Nostromo are absolutely believable. They're tired, stressed out, rude and bitchy and they spend a good lot of time griping and snapping at each other, but they drop what they're doing and stand together, protecting one another without hesitation when they must. The gore is minimal; the death of Kane is the bloodiest, nastiest moment in the whole film and because Kane, played by John Hurt, seems to be the nicest of the crew members, it just makes his painful death scene all the more horrible.Alien is a grim, visceral, satisfying horror film and remains the unsurpassed best film in the series. Alien is an established classic and should not be missed.","

"Alien","Christopher_Reid","21 January 2018","Alien is one of the best sci-fi movies of all time and it also happens to be a horror, making it all the more tense and exciting to watch. Its strength is its patience combined with top-notch visuals and music and an original plot.The look of the movie is incredible from start to finish. The Nostromo spaceship, the interiors, the Alien itself. Much of it was designed by H.R. Giger, a German with a unique and fascinating style. He also worked on Jodorowsky's Dune (which never got made) and you can see similarities in the design. They seem to combine the organic with the artificial and often border on the sexual. The inside of an alien spaceship is full of imaginative and strange details like nothing you've seen before. It's a shame Prometheus was such a terrible attempt at expanding on the story behind it...The score by the prolific Jerry Goldsmith is one of his best. There are faint echoes of more innocent sounding woodwinds with swelling, ominous strings in the background. It's mysterious but captures mankind's natural sense of wonder - it's not completely evil. As one character says at one point, they practically admire the alien, despite its capacity for destruction. We can't help but feel similarly. There's a juxtaposition of beauty and death. In Interstellar as well, the characters go on journeys at the edge of what's possible, seeing incredible things but also facing the serious risk of death. Our universe (and the beings in it) can be a harsh but beautiful mistress.Like all the great horror movies, the monster or threat is only gradually revealed. We're in the dark along with the characters. The details surrounding the alien, how it reproduces, what defence mechanisms it has, what on Earth it even is are very cool. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is a strong female character who is forced into a survival situation. She's one of the few to use common sense throughout the whole movie. She's cautious where others aren't. She know why certain rules are in place and gets frustrated that others would prefer to take risks. As it turns out, she was right the whole time.There are slow shots moving down corridors, letting us take in the designs of the walls, sometimes with emergency rotating lights and gas clouding things a bit. The movie takes its time setting things up and creating a mood. When things do happen, they have more impact because of the calm moments in between. But I enjoy the quiet moments just as much. There's always plenty to take in and ponder.There are many twists and turns in the plot. This keeps things tense - we don't know what might come out of nowhere, who can be trusted, where are you safe. There are some frustrating horror cliché moments where it seems like problems could have been prevented if the people were less stupid at key moments. But we also get to experience some imaginative situations which aren't yet possible with current technology but might well become realities in the near future.I have to admit, I don't find the alien itself scary. But I like its presence and the overall mood of the movie - it's a very well made horror. It's more about suspense than jump scares. It builds up the anticipation and a sense of inescapability. The tone is a bit depressing in some ways. These humans are in the middle of nowhere. But we do get the impression they're heading back to Earth and usually spend their journeys in some kind of cryo-sleep. This movie's an exception to their routine. But a film like Jaws is much easier to relate to while still putting the humans in a setting (the sea) where they're out of their comfort zone.Aliens is a great sequel but the rest are more average. Alien goes down as the best of its genre, a horror sci-fi that takes its time, confident in its story and visuals and creates one of the most memorable movie monsters of all time with characters we care about.","

"Alien","LoneWolfAndCub","24 June 2005","Alien is by far one of the greatest movies made. Directed by Ridley Scott, you can tell by the eerie, bleak opening credits that your not in for a pleasant ride.This movie starts out with introducing us to the crew of the Nostromo, who are returning to Earth. Along the way they receive a distress signal. They go and investigate and everything takes a turn for the worst when a crew member comes back on board with a parasite attached to his face. When the alien then breaks free all hell is raised.This is a great movie. The suspense is by far some of the best filmed and the dark atmosphere heightens are sense of terror. Well acted by Sigouney Weaver, Ian Holm and Tom Skerrit this is a genre defining movie which holds to date one of the most shocking scenes ever filmed. The 'Chestburster.' 5/5","

"Alien","Bryan_Roderick","26 April 2016","Alien (1979)To commemorate 4/26 Alien Day I thought I'd watch this movie. I think Ridley Scott is my favorite Ridley. That's saying a lot when you know how much I enjoy Daisy Ridley as an actress. Not only that, but he's also one of my favorite directors. Easily in my top 10 if not top 5. It's a shame that he's never won and Oscar.Alien is a staple in Sci-fi Horror. It's a hard genre to mash together and produce something good, let alone phenomenal. With the exception of the Alien series I can only name Pandorum off the top of my head that would fit into that meld of genres.Alien also had a strong female protagonist, one that wasn't really established as the main character till the second act. It's sort of reminiscent of Samus from Metroid.Speaking of main characters: Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver, is easily one of the most recognizable female characters in all of science fiction. I'd only suspect that maybe Princess Leia would be more. Even if it was her first time as the leading lady she did a wonderful job that stands the test of time.I'd be hard press to not talk about Kane, played by John Hurt, as a demonstration of not only an intense and agonizing scene, but the wonderful use of practical effects that will terrorize and also make you feel pity for him. I won't spoil this old movie, but I'm sure you all know which scene I'm talking about. If you don't you'll know by the second act.People seem to forget that Ash was played by Ian Holm. Bilbo from The Lord of the Rings, and Priest Vito Cornelius from Fifth Element. His scene towards the end of act II reminded me of playing Alien Isolation the video game. Though it should be the other way around. Remember the first time I saw Alien was when I was nine.John McClane will be known for his catch phrase. Darth Vader for his many quotable lines. I believe Ripley has an amazing phrase she says in the movie that out of context is not a spoiler. ""I got you! You son-of-a-bitch.""Can I say that the writing in this film is off the charts. People have a real reason for being there. Each character is on their own a beacon of personality. There isn't a character that's forgotten after watching the movie recently. I couldn't even name half of the party in the Hobbit and I saw that just the other day. Just goes to show you the respect I have for character development. Thank you Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett. They both worked on Total Recall, another great Sci- fi film.Verdict: Cult Classic, must watch. If you didn't get the chance to see it in theaters today, since it was playing at the Alamo Drafhouse, make a note in next years calendar. 4-26-2017.","

"Alien","heisenberg12","6 February 2016","There are relatively few films in history that are so solid and well made that they are the definition of a 4/4 star movie. Alien is one of those films. Movies have become so flawed in recent decades that truly handing out the full rating of 4 stars out of 4 (or 10 out of 10 for IMDb) has become a stretch.Without a doubt, Alien is not only a classic and the best science fiction horror movie of all time, but it is also one of the best films of all time. It is one of the coolest, most bad-ass, and horrifying films you will ever see.Sigourney Weaver is phenomenal in the role that shot her to fame. She is the heart of the film and plays her part with a sort of innocence and naive youthfulness that is endearing and real. Who would have ever thought a woman could be so bad-ass in a science fiction/action/horror movie in 1979? This movie is so good shot for shot that you will be glued to the screen. You can't miss a minute, nor will you want to. Even after all the similar sorts of horror and sci fi films that have been made which have borrowed from Alien, none of them can put together what Alien did. Some movies just rock. They just know how to open,know how to show, know how to tell, know how to explode, and know how to end. This is one of them. The ending is perfect and a perfect example of how to tell a story and end a movie, something many films of today can learn from.","

"Alien","Real_Review","11 June 2019","I had seen this a couple of times prior to watching it with the expressed purpose of reviewing the quality of the film. It's a classic - if you live in America and watch movies, then you really can't escape having seen 'Alien' (1979) at least a couple of times. I always thought it was ok - a fine movie. I'm not a sci-fi fan and I don't particularly care for Sigourney Weaver. However, I created this numeric review system since the last time I saw this film, and I have reviewed 130 or so films now for IMDB. Regularly reviewing films with this metric has changed the way I watch a movie. Now, there is this constant comparison in my mind, weighing the qualities of the film I am watching verses all other films of the genre.'Alien' (1979) is one of the greatest films of all time. The 1970's effects not only hold up, but are still impressive, due to extraordinary cinematography. Sigourney Weaver is amazing as Ripley and she adds surprise sexuality to the film toward the end. The writing shows the ship to be a microcosm of societal conflicts - duty verses survival, equal pay for equal work, and the battle for women's equality in group decision making. And, then there is The Alien. I capitalize his name (or title?) because he is one of the biggest box office draws of all time. Nicholas Cage wishes he had the career of The Alien.This film has some great qualities and no noticeable flaws. I am proud to award it my 6th perfect score.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

"Alien","LordBlacklist","5 March 2006","Review 1 of 4Alien is one of those films that will never age. It takes the simplest story and tells it as well as it can be told. I look at this film as the first in a trilogy, many may not agree with that, but Alien is a perfect beginning. It establishes an entire world and makes it feel real. Everything feels new and interesting. The things that are not explained in this film are exactly what makes it so fascinating to watch. Where did that ship come from? It doesn't matter. Like a good novel the film allows you to fill in the pieces with your own imagination. This goes for the alien it self, since we see so little of it that it becomes all the more terrifying for it. Ridley Scott is like a painter with his images. So many frames of this picture seem like they could be made into still photographs. Alien is science fiction and yet with the way it is shot and acted the movie feels like a documentary. It's that sense of verisimilitude that has made this movie last for so long. So much is present in the subtext. I get the feeling that one of the underlying themes of the film is that technology in the future will little by little overtake the lives of human beings, but paradoxically the nostromo still needs a crew in order to operate. I believe this film is one of the few realistic depictions of what encountering a real Alien life form might actually be like, and that it may not be what we are expecting. something that has always stood out to me about the film is the level of familiarity that the characters have with their surroundings. Many science fiction films love to draw attention to their futuristic technology but the characters in Alien react to it like a construction worker would with operating a crane: it is their job. This film is so good for so many reasons. The performances are nothing short of amazing, the set design exquisite, the score by Jerry Goldsmith is subtle and evocative, but the main reason for me that alien still holds up after all these years is that it takes itself very seriously. There is no Hollywood style self referential humor that would saturate the later entries of the series. Sigourney Weaver may have gotten the academy award nomination for Aliens, but her work here is very solid. She plays a character who through much hardship finds strength within herself that never appeared to be there to begin with. If you look at the Alien series as a trilogy this is the film where Ripley discovers who she really is, or defines her character, and the only way one can do that is through the choices they make in extreme circumstances. This is a film of great tension and subtly, well worth seeing over and over again to pick up on all the layers of subtext that may have been missed the first or second viewing.","

"Alien","secondtake","7 July 2009","Alien (1979)The First of a New Sci-Fi Horror BreedIt's hard to believe how fresh and scary this movie was at the time, but it's also a relief to see it still holds up as a well made movie even now. Is it a classic great movie? Almost, almost. But not quite, in the end--mostly because of some clichés and goofs in the acting and dialog--although it has really great moments. And it's a great way to discover director Ridley Scott's unique style.Certainly now that H. R. Giger the artist has gotten famous in his own right, the alien itself deserve special mention. And the sets are impressively otherworldly and familiar at the same time--not only the huge and hugely baroque ship, but the interior scenes on the planet toward the beginning. These are marvels whether or not your style (and for my money, the alien is a really improbable type of extraterrestrial, more at home in a comic book Hades than actual space). Another novelty to note, probably a product of the shift in movies in general since the 1960s, is the director's intention to keep things real and everyday. Things are dirty, people worry about their paychecks, and so on. This is a long way from the sterility of 2001 though head to head the earlier Kubrick film is on another level of art. I know a lot of people would rather be entertained, though, and Alien is entertaining. It's fast, it's scary, it's gory, it's messy. It's surprising. It's beautiful. And it spawned a whole series of follow-ups, the next one confusingly called Aliens (1986), also a very good take on the new genre.I first saw this when it came out in Colorado and it was on a huge, curving screen that wrapped around the audience, and I was really, truly scared. Now, thirty years later, the scary parts are still really scary, and it's edited so quickly you won't spend more than a minute on any one scene that doesn't quite click. Horror sci-fi has never been the same since.","

I watch it every year, and still enjoy this masterpiece in 2022. The successor to this one is superb also, but in different ways.","

"Alien","freaky_dave","2 March 2006","Alien was the first film that started it all. It gave us Aliens in 1986 and then two lesser sequels in the proceeding years. One can not review Aliens and not review Alien because both films go together so perfectly. Even though both films had their different styles, they both had Sigourney Weaver and one of the most fearsome creatures to ever grace the big screen. It's also my second most favorite horror movie of all time behind Jaws, a film I saw when I was just a wee lad.The crew of the Nostromo, a large space freighter that looks immense and incredibly scary thanks to director Ridley Scott's camera work, is awaken early from hyper sleep to investigate what seems to be a distress signal coming from a nearby planet. After a rough landing on the desolate planet, three of the crew members go out to investigate and find a large spaceship. However this is not all they find. Soon one of the crew members, who gets a little too curious, finds himself in a coma-like state with something attached to his face. He is soon brought back to the Nostromo by his shipmates, where they go about analyzing him to see what has happened. But this crew of working men and women have no clue what grisly horrors soon await them because they are no longer alone. Something dark and dangerous with no remorse for humankind will soon be stalking them one by one, and there seems to be nothing on board that is able to stop it.This movie was fantastic in every way. Ridley Scott uses mood and shadows as well as size to make the Nostromo look like the biggest, scariest haunted house ever. He also uses fabulous camera work to get his points across as well.The suspense in this movie builds and builds, and the creature is kept mostly in the shadows until when it attacks. And it attacks with a lethal efficiency. It is never seen for long periods of time, and this works perfectly. Like Spielberg with Jaws, Scott realizes that what is unseen is always more terrifying. One of the most effective murder scenes in this film is unseen, but we clearly hear the horrifying screams and panting of the victim and know that something horrible is happening.I can go on in on about this movie. I can talk about the music score which adds more dread to this film, and I can talk about the acting which was superb, but it would take up way too much space. I can also go on about the Oscar worthy special effects which are probably the best ever for 1979, but I won't. Lets just say this. If you like horror movies that build suspense and are not filled with senseless gore that looks unrealistic, then you are in for a treat. By the way this film does have some bloody scenes. One of the best involves sitting around a dinner table while everybody is eating. Yuk.Many people always compare Alien and Aliens. Some like Aliens the most and some like Alien the most. Both are classic sci-fi horror films by two different directors, and both get my highest marks, but if I had to chose, Alien would be my first choice, followed closely by Aliens.","

"Alien","ccthemovieman-1","10 January 2006","Usually I don't care for films that have nothing but unlikable characters and a lot of verbal blasphemy, but this was so well done that I just had to have this on a good DVD because I'll always watch this film every few years. It's just too interesting to ignore.The attractions are the incredible suspense; excellent photography and set design and memorable horror scenes. They didn't overdo the action scenes, either, as is so often the case with modern-day films. In fact, some of this might be too slow-moving for today's audience.The suspense, as crew members search for the killer alien, is almost unbearable at times and helps make up for the profane cast, all of whom are low-life people who would never be astronauts in real life. I personally applauded when Veronica Cartwright, who had one of the nastiest faces and mouths on screen, met her demise. The rest of the crew wasn't much classier. Since this movie came out, in fact, the sequels to this plus many other science fiction films seem to portray astronauts as trashy people which is the opposite of reality and just plain ludicrous.Anyway, Alien a memorable movie to anyone who has seen it. Who can ever forget the alien emerging from John Hurt's chest? That's a scene that stays with you forever. Others have tried to imitate the horror of that scene, but never quite been as successful.The restored DVD gives this 25-year-old film a new appearance. It looks fabulous and really highlights the great cinematography and superb direction by Ridley Scott. This is just great entertainment if you want to spend a night on the edge of your seat.","

"Alien","philipwest89","19 September 2011","In the crowded gallery of horror films, Alien hangs in a prominent position, high above its rivals. By virtue of its deft blend of psychology and physical horror, it lifts the genre out of the graveyard and into deepest space . While its scale models, grimy characters, and shimmering soundtrack may no longer appeal to a generation of audiences who revel in the hotchpotch storyboards of 'Drag Me To Hell', Alien still commands great respect, and rightly so. It has not lost any of its cutting edge, even after thirty-two years. Alien's simplistic premise keeps the film tight and lean; a taut, slow-burning game of cat and mouse involving a vicious, shadowy creature whose acidic blood can melt the very girders of the ship it has invaded, and a compelling blend of the brave (Ripley), cautious (Dallas), and mechanical (Ash). There are no meaningless references to childhood memories or superfluous romance. The characters and their personalities are weathered, believable, and their mission plausible. The profit-driven search for mineral ore provides a realistic corporate counterpoint to the main story, which sees the seven crew members dragged, somewhat unwillingly, into the extraterrestrial's world. With the possible exception of Ash, they did not seek this encounter; the computers lead them to it. How each crew member responds to the situation is key; in effect, seven sub plots form, each focusing upon something different, be it a crew member's mannerisms, their way of thinking, or indeed, a violent death (Chestburster). This is Alien's greatest appeal; it provides an insight into the human mind, as psychological horror movies should. Which crew member do we, the audience, root for, admire, or resent? Who can trust who? Sigourney Weaver, so often credited with inspiring a roll-call of female cinematic heroines, rightly earns every syllable of praise that has been heaped upon her since the film's release; Ripley's resourcefulness and courage are marvellous to behold. However, as the genuinely disturbing android Ash, Ian Holm is supreme; his reserved demeanour and considered approach masking the motives that lay hidden out of sight. As an exercise in sound and vision, Alien is a memorable spectacle. There are many moments that are striking. The colossal hauler Nostromo, futuristic and industrial in design, dominates the screen as it crawls slowly, almost gracefully, towards Earth. The sheen of the soundtrack and the echoing calls from the freighter to 'Antarctica Traffic Control' are atmospheric to the core, while the fogbound alien planet, littered with blackened mountains and the silhouette of the hulking, derelict vessel, is hauntingly desolate. Spaces where, in modern horror films, the gaps would be filled with meaningless dialogue, are left vacant. The viewer can interpret what they see with no need for speech. Ridley Scott's vision of 'horror first, science-fiction second' was, without a doubt, fulfilled; audiences should ignore the flashing lights and controls of the spaceship and focus upon the Alien. Around which corner does it lurk? Who becomes its next victim? Alien is a film of immense quality. It has the capacity to frighten and to deceive. It flows precisely from scene to scene with no wasted shots and most tellingly, does not stray off course by incorporating fanciful special effects or worthless roles filled by fringe characters. One spacecraft, one extraterrestrial, seven humans, and one cat is all we are given. And quite simply, anything more would have been a waste. While the genre of horror may have moved on, the art of horror is captured perfectly, here, in the blackness of space.","

"Alien","chaos-rampant","14 September 2012","This one really needs no introduction, this pitch black vision of an unfathomable darkness. If I was asked to run a film class, this would be a prime example to study: collaboration, reinvention, conceptual design that accommodates damage to it, the journey of shared vision from page to space. It does everything right that could easily have gone wrong. The backbone is an extremely coherent space world and mythology, as complicated as we find in Star Wars but with only necessary snippets provided instead of platitudes. On top of that, you have (expertly executed) the age old story of an encounter with ancient evil. But this one has biology, structure that horrifies more. The icing on the cake is a final layer about the nature of the encounter, your encounter with 'alien' vision. Hold this thought.It is amazing to revisit this in retrospect of how much it changed and how much has changed since.In the 1970's, one of the hottest and most troubled film properties for a while was Dune. The scope and detail of Herbert's books called for a a film on a massive scale, a blockbuster, and that was a time when the blockbuster was still a fluid concept. It was a time when you could dream the unthinkable: a 10-hour Jodorowsky extravaganza with the creative involvement of Dali, Welles, Gloria Swanson, Delon, Jagger, designed by H.R. Giger and scored by Pink Floyd. Extensive pre-production work was axed when money decided the venture was impractical, and basically nuts. The world safely went with the Spielberg-Lucas model, nurtured from Jaws to Star Wars. The prevalent business model for a Hollywood blockbuster these days, is a bankable producer-director in charge (he can be a little creative), and contract out the design and effects-work to individual SFX studios. We're getting poorer every year and the products more bland, because of this IKEA mentality.Anyway, the smoke from the colossal Dune collapse turbulently shifted in two directions. We got the two Phillip K. Dick adaptations in the 80's, one of them Scott's Bladerunner. The other is right here. Inbetween, Scott had been next in line after Jodorowsky to tackle and swiftly abandon Dune.What happened, is that a guy called Dan O'Bannon (effects-man in that first Dune) drifted to screen writing to pull himself up from a financial hole. Out of many stories he penned, one was about an alien passenger wreaking havoc mid-space. In its first incarnation, it was going to be a Corman foamcore cheapie called Starbeast. Hollywood tapped the project, considering workingman Aldrich to direct. Daft choice, thankfully axed. This one needed new, excited blood like O'Bannon.Ridley Scott came onboard, fresh and eager from a Kubrick-influenced debut. Kubrick's 2001-notions of cinematic space as a clean and silent roar, elegant design, and controlled visual eddies from symphonic flows of the camera, all of that was carried over into this, and is openly acknowledged in the first shot. O'Bannon(a horror guy) introduced Scott to Texas Chainsaw Massacre and more pieces from the Dune jigsaw: Foss and Moebius were carried over to sketch the world of the film. H.R. Giger was flown in from Switzerland, with alien-designs so disturbing he was held over at LAX.And that is how it came together. The story was recycled from spare parts (Forbidden Planet, Planet of the Vampires), dressed in 'used' scrapyard aesthetic and Giger's diseased-looking biology, and finally given Texas Chainsaw- violence in the engine gears and fabric. And the nature of that collaborative encounter with the product of vision is sketched in the actual film, in the way it made a difference.You have a colorful bunch of professionals in the same 'ship', each one a specialist in his field. Each one has his own logic about what the voyage is all about, but not necessarily equal say. They are earthbound before a beacon signals from the void.It isn't until later that we find out a narrative of discovery had been set in motion around them, and that narrative is controlled by non-human agents, actual devices (Mother - Ash), which is why it's both simple and precise. The actual author won't be seen until Prometheus, one of many things mucked-up there.The discovery is of something that we go on to understand has structure and design, and the instinct to do as designed challenges human conscience. And this is why Scott's presentation matters: it is not a guy in a suit we see, it is abstract shape, pure organism morphing before our eyes.The second expansion is that it is not the story of explanations that matters, but the journey to retrieve new vision. This has been obscured, because that vision is a monster, and because on both ends of that story (Weyland - Engineerworld), you have only vague bits of clearly engineered worlds that we want to know more about (hence, the heavy Alien fanfiction that distracts by too much clarification).It's all here though. The story was something to get you to where the void signals.The real deal is in how we come to terms with something that is new and seemingly dragged strange and whole from the void.And it takes a dissonant - human - element to muck up the precise Weyland gears of the narrative, and actually give birth to the thing. A machine would never be curious enough to touch the egg.This is brilliant. It's all in the coordinated bursts of machine-reason to human-chaos to inscrutable creature-reason and back again, and the way that is choreographed into an environment that bleeds and bursts into our vision (best seen in the discovery of the alien ship). Our vision itself is the alien being born, space impregnated and convulsing with the process.","

"Alien","azathothpwiggins","15 April 2022","Upon its release, it was obvious that Director Ridley Scott's ALIEN was something special, unlike any science fiction-horror film before it.Drawing loosely from past deep space adventures, Scott took us into a desolate, haunted place full of dread and terror. Primarily a ""monster movie"", ALIEN presents us with a creature from our darkest nightmares. H. R. Geiger's design is still fresh and startling to this day. It's sleek, reptilian body, topped by that elongated, eyeless head, is an incredibly effective creation.The human crew of the Nostromo are mostly nourishment for this hellish thing.The classic scenes abound, from the discovery of the egg chamber, to the ""bloody birth"", to the discovery that one crewmember just may be hiding a secret, etc.That's where Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) comes in. She's resourceful, smart, and called on to be far stronger than she might, at first, appear. Ms. Weaver made this role singular. We will always remember the final confrontation. Ripley shattered stereotypes, setting the standard for a generation of tough female heroes.Imagine sitting in a dark theater, having never seen anything remotely like this before.

"Alien","SimonJack","14 June 2022","Coming at the end of the 1970s, ""Alien"" was the first really great sci-fi monster film since the 1950s. That was ""the"" decade of sci-fi monster flicks that produced some films with fantastic fright factors. Those were some of the best date movies ever - speaking from experience, as girls would huddle close to their boyfriends or dates watching ""The Blob"" seep through air vents of the movie theater on the screen. ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" of 1954, ""The Thing from Another World"" of 1951, ""It Came From Beneath the Sea"" of 1955 were some of the best sci-fi monster films of the decade that had high fright factors. Of course, there were some films that verged almost on the comical. And some others were outlandish but nevertheless had decent frightful scenes. ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"" and ""The Black Scorpion"" of 1957 come to mind.Well, this film, ""Alien,"" restored the fright factor in sci-fi monster movies, and may have spiked interest in more such films, judging from the stepped up output through the end of the century and into the 21st century. As others have noted, it was the breakout film for Sigourney Weaver's career, and deservedly so. All of the cast are good in this story that topped all previous monster films for horror in its namesake alien. Not until Jurassic Park four years later was there such a heinous monster created. Yet, even with the scary T-Rex of that film, the alien monster in this film still stands out as the ugliest, scariest of monsters of all time cinema.","

Alien is so much better than the pap we get from present-day Hollywood.Watch this movie and be shocked by how it a) takes some time to build up its cast, who aren't wisecracking, superhuman hunks and lingerie model types, b) uses practical effects (out of necessity) that actually look and move like solid objects that could exist, and c) doesn't revel in pointless gore or rattle the screen with a ton of frenetically cut action scenes that do nothing to further the plot.In short, ladies and gentleman, this is a film that takes some time and care with its story. It may be a simple story. It may be basically a haunted house thriller or Jaws in space, but it wrings every last drop of tension from the script, setting and monster, making for a classic that will watched for decades after the likes of Transformers or World War Z are mostly forgotten.One final note about Alien and this type of thriller in general: it heightens the audience experience to wonder how they'd react in the same situation, whether they'd have the guts to face down a snarling monster like the xenomorph or if they'd cr*p their pants in the corner and wait to be eaten. Because Alien features characters that actually talk, panic, squabble and make decisions like some plausible representation of actual human beings, this is a possibility. The film is called Alien, but it's also very much about the humans.","

"Alien","benxrichardson","25 January 2022","Watching Alien in 2022, it's hard to believe the film was made in the 70's. This is a masterclass in film making. Ridley Scott did an amazing job with Alien.Sigourney Weaver is outstanding, she set a new standard for female scifi/action stars.Alien is a must watch for anyone who loves film and enjoys an edge of your seat thrill ride.","

"Alien","nmholland","5 March 2016","Alien is directed Ridley Scott and stars Sigourney Weaver in her breakout role as Ellen Ripley, a female astronaut that belongs to a crew that receives a distress call from an unexplored planet while in space. They respond to the call by landing on the planet, and searching it. They seemingly find nothing, but, upon leaving, find an unwanted visitor aboard their ship. Once they figure out that this ""alien"" is superior to humans in most every way, the film becomes a battle to either kill, or at most escape, the deadly creature.This film is widely considered one of the best horror movies of all time, and I can really see why. I can also see why some consider it one of the best films of all time. Alien is teeming with suspense, and keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat for almost the entire run time, say for some exposition in the beginning. Every time the audience gets even a subtle glimpse of the beast, each and every time there's a subtle jump, singularly due to the amazing practical effects of the alien itself.To start with some pros, the directing is utterly fantastic, to say the least. Ridley Scott does such a good job working the camera; it makes every emotion pop right out of the screen and suck the watcher right into the movie, drawing out the tone drastically. Some of the long takes can pull forth the tension throughout the scene, or the fear that a specific character feels at the present time.The acting is also amazing, starting with Sigourney Weaver. She gives one of the most breathtaking female performances in cinema history. Her character, Ellen Ripley, is a very strong and independent female; one in which no male is required to make her who she is, unlike most female leads today. If movies delivered more characters like Ripley, films would be better in almost every way.The hands down best thing about this film, however, is the simplicity of the plot. One can only imagine a person pitching the idea for this film, saying ""a crew of astronauts are stuck on a ship with an alien that kills them."" The straightforwardness of the plot is so astounding, it makes one do a double take upon the complexity of a horror, or even action, film in the modern day. This simplicity is present in many ""best films of all time,"" such as Die Hard (1988), or Jaws (1975). Overcomplicated plots are one of the many reasons why too many movie goers say ""they don't make'em like they used to.""Overall, Alien is understandably one of the best films of all time, thanks to the characters, directing, and clarity of the plot. I'm going to give Alien an A+, or a 10 out of 10.","

"Alien","preppy-3","12 March 2002","SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!How this is considered a classic is beyond me.  I saw it when it first came out in 1979.  I was 16--I was basically bored or disgusted by it.  22 years later my opinion hasn't changed.  Why do I hate this?  Let me count the ways:1) The plot is old hat.  It's basically a haunted house movie set in outer space.2)  There is zero characterization.  The crew members are virtually interchangable.  How can you care about somebody getting killed when you don't know who they are?3)  Getting a bunch of talented actors and giving them nothing to work with.4)  Overdone set design.  Yes, it's impressive but it overwhelms what little plot there is.  Nice set design does not make a movie.5)  People stumble around in dark corridors and dark rooms looking for a cat.  Not once but TWICE!  And this is after they know there's a killer alien on board!6)  What the hell is a cat doing on a space mission?  7)  The characters act incredibly stupid.8)  The alien looks dumb--it's just a guy in a slightly modified alligator suit.  Cool set of double teeth though.9)  What does the alien do with its victims?  Two of them just disappear.10)  Why is the alien killing them?  What reason?  We're never given one. Oh wait--because it's in the script.  That's why!11)  Sigourney Weaver strips to down to her underwear for no reason whatsoever at the end.12)  IT'S DULL!!!!!!!!The only scene that works is the chest burster with John Hurt--but that's only a minute or two in a two hour film.  Long, dull and stupid.  I give this a 1--I wish I could go lower--it deserves a 0.  Avoid at all costs. See ""Aliens"" instead.  That's 100 times better than this.","

"Alien","adamjohns-42575","19 February 2022","Alien (1979)-As with any film the cat is the best bit and excellently performed by Jonesy.The cast that supports Jones is very good too, however I have never particularly seen what the fuss is all about with Sigourney. She does well in everything I've seen her in, but I don't feel that there is anything specifically noteworthy about her.Ian Holm on the other hand does a fantastic job as Ash, he's very sinister and you don't know why or if he's going to do something crazy whenever he is on screen.Personally I could have done without Lambert, but I suppose there has to be characters like her.The film is not fast paced to begin with, but manages to stay interesting throughout and it's surprisingly easy to believe, which is probably due to the set and props which are extraordinary.I find it so easy to imagine a future where these characters are grouped together on a spaceship of a design like the one seen. It's obvious that every detail had all been carefully thought about before production even began and that's why this film appears on so many ""Must See"" lists.The special effects are actually very good for the time also, with the exception perhaps of the little fella that hurtles across the dining table.The adult ""Alien"" of the title is brilliantly creepy and the simple idea of having them glisten and drip really adds to the hideous bug/lizard like nature of the beast.It's not a complicated watch and the simple storyline is what, for me, makes it a classic. It delivers something quite powerful, without getting confusing.Pay attention though as there is a lot that is used in 'Prometheus' (2012), which I had completely forgotten about until I re-watched this very good film.903.55/1000.","

"Alien","Steve_Nyland","6 March 2017","It is impossible for me to write an objective review of ALIEN simply because I believe it is not just the best motion picture film ever made, but is a pinnacle of artistic expression that owes its debt to pretty much everything that came before it. The story was a cultural funnel into which it all flowed. The only thing it can be correctly compared to might be the original 1977 release of STAR WARS even though its objectives could not have been more different. It is the most thorough and convincing portrayal of the future ever committed to celluloid. Certainly more convincing than 2001: A SPACE ODDITY, which is too sterile and gleaming. The future will not look like a dentist's office.The future will be ugly, loud and busy. It will be a retrofitted mess of the past, present and futuristic forms. Like a city which adapts to changing times by modernizing certain parts while still facilitating its old function with its crumbling old infrastructure. If you're curious to see what the future of commercial space travel may look like watch this film. Humans will come and go, we may be tooling about on space craft, we may be crossing vast distances of space, and yes: It stands to reason we will encounter life forms startlingly different than ourselves. Unless we are very lucky it is almost inevitable that like other creatures on this planet they will react to us with fear, hostility or aggression for primal reasons related to territoriality or survival. It is doubtful we will have much in common.We won't meet these alien life forms by looking for them. We will come across them as we go about our human ways, pressing deeper into the universe while going about our mundane business on the surfaces of worlds never meant to accommodate warm blooded protein and sugar consuming bipedal air breathers. I doubt the aliens we do find will look like HR Giger's creations, but at least in Giger we finally had an artist's vision for a life form that is suitable for the vastness of space. It is infinitely adaptable, roughly taking the form of whatever creature it gestates inside of and born ready-made to thrive in whatever the host's native environment may be. It's a weapon — natural or engineered, doesn't matter — a DNA replicating machine which mimics its host creature so it may corrupt and devour it more efficiently. Here it takes the bastardized form of a man and effortlessly eliminates five human adults inside of 48 hours. It would have infected whatever biosphere it was introduced into, skillfully devouring, replicating, spawning and breeding until a critical mass is reached and all other forms of life in that biosphere would be eliminated in a survival of the fittest test with one inevitable outcome. The only way that its threat would be believable and frightening is if the fictional universe the story takes place in is 100% convincing. ALIEN's is, boasting the most effective production design in the history of cinema, bested only by NASA's Apollo moon landing program.We believe in the universe it is set, the people who inhabit it, and the hardware they use to perform the tasks required by their mode of existence. If we were not thoroughly convinced the entire premise would fall like a house of cards. Ridley Scott, Dan O'cannon, Ron Shussett, Ron Cobb, Christopher Foss, H.R. Giger, John Mollo, Roger Dickens, Les Dilley, Brian Johnson, Jerry Goldsmith, Terry Rawlins, and the cast chosen to enact the story all collaborated seamlessly to produce a completely convincing facade telling a tightly plotted story about humans stumbling across an alien life form. Through duplicity and against protocol, the organism is allowed to infect the human biosphere within the ship, and the crew inevitably discover that the only way to contain the outbreak to their ship is to destroy it. It is a perfect metaphor for the necessary evils of modern life.The film was successful and its dominance of the horror/action movie market spawned an outbreak of similarly themed films, some of which came close to replicating ALIEN's impact on our culture, but none really being able to introduce anything very useful to the premise. Queens laying eggs dumbs the creature down to familiar Terrestrial life patterns. I would prefer to think that the universe holds many surprises about how life thrives that aren't anything like the patterns we are comfortable with. The bug hunt in the first sequel is well done, but whatever success its offspring may have enjoyed all relate back to the singular vision and urgency behind the artistic quest that this film set out to resolve.It does so in ways that go beyond the impact of individual scenes. Every film of its kind made since has been influenced by ALIEN in one way or another, and that influence will continue for as long as humans make films. Nobody will ever be able to ""undo"" its contributions, negate them from our society's palette. You can mix in Predators or A list casts with super-real computer effects, but it will always come back to this film and the startling possibilities it suggested. If it hadn't been done so well we wouldn't still be talking about it, proof that they really did get it right. We have only just begun to explore what forms the possibilities suggested by ALIEN may take, and someone someday will get it just as right in their own era's equivalent. I hope I'm around to see that happen, maybe even have a hand in making it. Who knows.10/10","

"Alien","ritera1","25 June 2012","What? It's the same guy? Can't be! The only reason I went back to Alien is 'cause I just saw Prometheus. You know. The one that is supposedly not a prequel to Alien but is nothing but that.I think the problem with Ridley Scott is that he was able to get his teeth into the script process in his latter films. I would have to imagine that he was controlled and was far away from the screenplay for Alien, since this is far better than Prometheus.Unlike the latter, I liked and was invested in the characters of Alien. I couldn't figure out why 'cause the presentation of such was so similar. Then I realized that it was 'cause they were workin' class people. The title card says it's a mining vessel. My mind then made the connection due to real life and past caricatures. Then the quality acting helped, too.And characters were the main problem in Prometheus. Ill-defined and vague. I didn't care. (The mohawk guy was portrayed as a no-nonsense in-it-for-the-money guy. That's the blueprints for a mercenary or gun for hire. Not a geologist.) I miss the sci-fi of the 70s and 80s. Sure, the computer graphics were silly compared to today. Along with all the blinking lights that obviously had no purpose. But the models had dimension and the shooting style had grit. And story was king.The best part of Alien is that it could breath. Slow and steady but it all had a purpose and was interesting. But then dozens and dozens of horror movies took that as ""kill time for 45-minutes and then start the movie"".Then someone thought they could second-guess the process and invited the marketing guys to the table. What a bad decision!","

"Alien","sage4676","14 January 2023","I saw this movie in theaters when it was released in 1979 at least four times. I was just turning 18 that year so yes I went on my own accord. Eventually, when VCRs, DVDs, Blu-Rays came out I owned it ineasch version, and it was worth it. Ridley Scott raised and set the bar very hi for any subsequent Sci-fi movies to come out after it. Any other Sci-fi flick I saw after this one was, 'How didi it compare toAlien?"". This Is one of those movies that no matter how many times you see it, viewing it remains worthy while. Sigorney Weaver set the bar for female leads too. After her performance, female leads as badasses became not so uncommon. I loved the movie so much I even looked up how the creature was designed and learned the H. R. Giger was the primary influence on what the creature looks like. Several more Ridley Scott films fell into my favorite list too. This film is so good that I can count on one hand how many I have given a '10' rating to. I personally think that 'Aliens' is just good, but takes a different approach to compete storyline. I Aien, the fist time yiiu see the creature emerging, you will be totally surprised, and it's worth it. When you become a fan, I can only suggest that in a bare minimum of items to own, buy the first three of this series and you will be please.","

"Alien","roystephen-81252","24 February 2016","I love science-fiction, but as for horror films, I'm not particularly fond of them as a genre. Most of them are cheaply done, badly written, even downright ridiculous, and not frightening at all. There are some exceptions, however. There are a handful of movies that I consider genuinely scary (movies that give you at least one or two sleepless nights, like The Exorcist or David Lynch's surrealistic nightmare, Eraserhead) and Alien is the best of them all.I have seen Alien countless times and it never ceases to amaze me. None of its sequels or prequels managed to reach such a level of perfection (although I liked them all with the exception of Alien3). The production design (especially H.R. Giger's creations) and the visual effects do not feel dated at all even after all these years. The eerie music and sound effects still make your hair stand on end. The sequence inside the interiors of the derelict ship, the eggs, the facehugger, the 'birth scene' – all iconic moments that are just as shocking today as they were in 1979. The cast are all impeccable, but the multi-faceted Ian Holm (Napoleon & Love, Brazil, Lord of the Rings) and Sigourney Weaver deliver especially mesmerising performances. (I consider Weaver's performance in Alien her best in the series.)Ridley Scott's blood-curdling classic is a must-see for every SF and every movie fan.","

"Alien","tedg","27 June 2001","Different WorldsSpoilers herein.I've just rewatched `Alien,' `Aliens' and `Alien Resurrection.' Considered simply as films, each is a fine film but they come from worlds that are more different from each other than the normative world of now is to the world of any of them. Just viewing them is a course in filmmaking.Ridley Scott's `Alien' is the most impressive, knowing that it was only his second film, that every effect is physical, and that the budget was so low the spacecraft is cobbled together from used aircraft parts. Even at this early point, Scott has the ability to create a unique look and has the mastery of craft to coordinate every element (acting, score, movement) to reinforce that look. That he chose Giger to base the look on was brilliant. Organic darkness -- evil embodied in living things. The alien ship, though only briefly shown, is a sequence that will live way past the time that the monsters of the series are forgotten; that blending of beast, environment and narrative is unique in all filmdom. Really amazing that the sequels didn't go back to that ship. Scott has grown to be one of our best and most original filmmakers -- Alien and `Blade Runner' (with `Forbidden Planet') are the very best `real' scifi films we have, meaning films that are not just adventure films.Where `Alien' is scifi in the service of horror, `Aliens' is scifi in the service of action. Aliens is a war film, and equally impressive as one of Cameron's earliest. Movement and conflict. More emphasis on the familiar is necessary for this approach, so we see the sets and costumes less adventuresome. This is a thrill which uses the trappings of scifi only as another thing with which to impress. The mood created is projected not into the image as with Scott, but into the theater as something to amaze. Cameron hasn't evolved at all from this film, only been given ever bigger effects with which to amaze. So one might consider this his most `genuine' film.`Resurrection' seems to not be as admired by the fan base. But I think it every bit the equal of the other two. In this case, we also have a new director, a European with two fantasy tales under his belt. But those set a tone that is strikingly weird: the tone not in the setting, but in the psychological space in the story. And that's what we have here. In Cameron's film, every character is a stereotype. Here, every character is an anti-stereotype: the black guy isn't jive; the cripple is the toughest; the sex kitten is a robot... even the hero isn't really. This is also the most cinematic use of the camera, using the psychological eye. Scott dwells, Cameron moves, Jeunet examines. He doesn't mind annotating the past films (rather like Van Sant's `Psycho' annotates Hitchcock's).The only negative thing I note in the sequels is that Weaver isn't adaptable enough to understand and get behind these diverse visions. She understands Scott. Cameron doesn't really care, but she is outclassed by Jeunet.Seeing any one of these enhances the appreciation for the other two.","

The music plays perfectly as the word 'ALIEN' slowly appears, line by line. Then there are the establishing shots of the ship; poorly maintained, claustrophobic.And then there's basically forty minutes of people in a ship pondering and eating and getting along (or not). The film has one little thing that allows it to draw you along so slowly - a promise. A promise made by the advertisements and hype that this was going to kick your ass. You just had to wait.But when it happens, it happens. Though the film doesn't speed up per se, there's a lot more happening in front of the screen to make it at least look like stuff's going on. The first half crawls almost depressingly, but the second half catches your eye and refuses to let go.I suggest everyone sees this film. Even if you skip through the beginning, you need to see this.

"Alien","michael-3204","11 July 2016","I first saw ""Alien"" the day after it opened, knowing very little about it except that the cryptic TV commercial for the film looked cool and its advertising slogan (""In space, no one can hear you scream"") was compelling. Sigourney Weaver and Ridley Scott were mostly unknown and the rest of cast, while recognizable, weren't typically headliners in highly anticipated Hollywood releases. This had ""B-movie"" written all over it, and in many ways it is very much a B-movie made with A-list skill, craftsmanship and imagination.It's impossible, all these years and several viewings later, to separate myself from my first experience of watching it. I can't forget that I nearly jumped back a row, to the accompanying screams of a nearly full theatre of moviegoers, during the now-famous chest- bursting scene. The iconic imagery of the film -- the sensuous design of the alien ship, the ominously large corpse of the alien spaceman fused to his giant perch with bones bent outward, the unknowable originality of the titular creature and its unpredictable life cycle, the lived-in character of the commercial towing vessel Nostromo (""Star Wars"" excepted, in most depictions of space travel at the time everything had a factory-fresh gleam) -- all became almost instantly iconic and influential for a reason. Having experienced this film's introduction into an unsuspecting world, it's not possible to look at it through the eyes of contemporary film fans who come to it later and might judge it by a different standard.All of which it to say, I admit to being incredibly biased in my assessment of how well ""Alien"" holds up despite the considerable advances in visual effects since it was made. What looks a bit dated today is the depiction of the on-board computer ""Mother"" and the bizarre blinky-light room in which it is housed. Most of the rest of the tech depictions are fine, mainly because the story doesn't rely on whiz-bang futuristic tech to propel it. The basic (and, alas, inadequate) weaponry with which Nostromo's crew tries to contain the alien was understandable then and now, on a non-military vessel with a civilian crew. The surprise reveal about the true nature of one of the crew members still makes sense against the backdrop of corporate shenanigans in which the crew operates. Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett's story carefully constructs the sense in which the deck is stacked against our heroes in ways they don't fully grasp until a few of them have died, and it does so mainly by making the crew anything but heroic. These are ordinary workers who snipe at each other and complain about their pay and try to advance their place in the hierarchy the way workers everywhere do, and maintain an uneasy camaraderie and mutual respect despite workplace tensions that are eminently relatable.A lot has been written about this film as a metaphor for both male and female rape and the predatory nature of sexuality. While the film's design is stuffed with incredible sexual imagery, I'm not really sure what that analysis gets you. ""Alien"" is essentially a very effective, beautifully shot horror movie set in outer space. It employed and helped solidify horror movie tropes we're all familiar with. It's not afraid to take its time to build atmosphere, character and suspense, which might (but shouldn't) try the patience of people used to the faster pace of current films. To me, it was and remains an almost perfect movie.","

"Alien","Theo Robertson","20 May 2003","Nice to see that a few all too rare reviewers agree that Ridley Scott`s ALIEN is a rather overrated film , yes I agree with everyone that the set design is fantastic but the film suffers from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY syndrome in that it has a very slow sterile atmosphere which makes it difficult to connect with the characters . The only character I felt any sympathy with was Kane and that`s only because he was played by the excellent John Hurt . As for the rest of the crew I couldn`t care less if they got eaten or not . To all intents ALIEN is a corny B movie script ( I think we can ignore all the pseudo-intellectual claptrap involving subtext - it`s a B movie script ) produced by A list technicians Trivia point : Ridley Scott was working as a BBC designer in 1963 and legend has it that he was due to work on a fledgling sci-fi series but became unavailable at the last moment which meant Raymond Cusack worked on this new show called DOCTOR WHO and it was he who designed the Daleks undoubtedly the most visually interesting creations in the history of television.Talking of DOCTOR Who check out the 1975 story ` The Ark In Space ` which has a very similar premise to ALIEN  but is far more enjoyable","

""Flawless"" as the director recently put it on a science fiction doc series. This film also had a shocking historic scene in history and effect on the audience right up there with Jaws and Psycho. A 4k resolution remastered blu-ray disc anniversary edition has just been released for the home video market for a great price. A must have Also, I noticed that this film (made 40 years ago) is even more ahead of its time in terms of direction and style- making its place matching style-wise within the avant-gsrdish series/sequels it has spawned (Prometheus, Alien: Covenant, Aliens, Alien 3 etc.)...its fresh and modern-like. Fine cinema wine. With Ultra-unique creature design by the late h.r. Giger. The music score, by the late Jerry Goldsmith, deserves more kudos than it has had because of the psychological intense mysterious mood it creates and weaves. A score that perhaps creates best a: true dynamic science fiction psychiatric characterization of what fear, environment, darkness and communicates the personality of a monster/otherworldly species.","

"Alien","avik-basu1889","1 January 2016","'Alien' is the first film in one of the most well known and renowned film franchises of all time. One of the major reasons why 20th Century Fox green-lit this film was the resounding success of another little film set in space known as 'Star Wars' at the box office. 'Alien' was based on a screenplay written by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett and was directed by Ridley Scott. A crew aboard the space vessel Nostromo on their way home pick up an SOS warning from a distant planet. They decide to check out the planet and the subsequent events lead to an experience for the entire crew which can only be described as nightmarish. Although Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett's screenplay was great and had thematic depth, for me 'Alien' became the masterful horror film that it is due to one man's visual flair and complete command over the subtleties and nuances of filmmaking and camera movement, and that man is Ridley Scott. This film in the hands of some other director could have easily been reduced to a generic, silly genre film about alien monsters which were released in abundance during the 50s, 60s and 70s. But Ridley Scott made something that truly distinguished itself from all previous alien monster films. The claustrophobic atmosphere that Scott creates is enough to suck the viewer in. The film like most Ridley Scott films looks absolutely fantastic. The visual attention to detail is meticulous. The alien planet looks as real and authentic as any alien planet has ever looked on film. Scott slightly borrows the slow and gradual style of storytelling and tension building that Spielberg used in 'Jaws'. Like 'Jaws', we don't see the Xenomorph a lot. But that adds to the tension, the fear and the claustrophobia. The lighting, the editing and the pacing, all work together to the fullest effect.Although most people make a connection between 'Star Wars' and 'Alien' due to their contrasting styles. Both the films were released very close to each other and both films were set in space. But while 'Star Wars' was a fantasy fairy tale, 'Alien' was straight up horror. I can understand this comparison, but for me 'Alien' shares a deep thematic connection with '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Both films deal with the duel between man and machine and they both explore the question: What it means to be human? Incidentally this was also the basic theme of Ridley Scott's next sci-fi film 'Blade Runner'. After knowing that Ash was actually a droid, on reflection, I do think that the relationship between Ash and Ripley has some similarities with the relationship between HAL and Bowman. Ripley at the beginning refuses to let Kane (John Hurt) in by obeying the company laws while he has the face- hugger on his face, but Ash actually lets him in which might seem to be a very humane act. But later his true identity gets revealed and he has this beautiful monologue about how he appreciates the Xenomorph's perfect body structure and its purity which lies in its lack of emotions and feelings. This film is also undeniably about the ill-effects of capitalism. The Weyland-Yutani Corporation sends this crew to a mission as dangerous as this without informing them anything for the sole purpose of acquiring this alien life form and using it as a weapon. This shows the lack of humanity in the way the big corporation treats its workers. This lack of respect for the workers and the existing class division also gets repeatedly hinted at with Brett and Parker's constant complaints about being underpaid. These workers are made to go through hell and utter madness in distant parts of the universe where they themselves are alien just because the big corporation wants to use the Xenomorph for its weapons division. The miserable plight of the crew in completely mad and alien surroundings has a thematic link with the madness in 'Apocalypse Now' where young men are made to fight in mad environments. To be honest, the Xenomorph is not the villain in the film, the villain is the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.Another very apparent element of the script is the sexual subtext. The Xenomorph and other alien elements and sets were designed by H.R. Giger based on his own artwork which clearly have sexual undertones. Right from the design of the Xenomorph's body to the concept of the face-hugger and chest-burster, there is a sexual angle to the narrative that hints at themes of rape and unwanted pregnancies. Through Ridley Scott's imagery, it is thematically implied that the corporation in the way it renders the human workers expendable is actually devouring them. The face-hugger uses the body of the host to give birth to the Xenomorph, in the same way thematically the corporation is using the helpless crew just to serve its own purposes. Although the human characters in the film don't have a lot of back story, but the conversations that they have among each other are extremely realistic which makes the characters believable as ordinary human beings. Every character gets distinguished from the other due to the naturalistic acting. However for me the two best performances in the film come from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley and Ian Holm as Ash. They play off each other brilliantly. Ripley's character has evolved over the course of the entire Alien franchise. In this film Ripley is the indefatigable survivor.I only have one minor complaint. I think the screenplay and Scott's execution of the scene leading up to Brett's death could have been a little better instead of following a bit of horror trope. However the death itself is chillingly shot.'Alien' is one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made due to the care with which Ridley Scott treated every individual element of the film and also due to every one else who worked with Scott and contributed with their own ideas.","

"Alien","KineticSeoul","1 October 2009","Although this movie was probably very good when it came out in 1979, while now watching it in 2009. The movie just seemed too dated, and I don't mean with the special effects, cinematography or anything like that. It's just that this film just didn't add any surprises, even when the audience comes across a certain twist it doesn't add anything to the movie that will add any shock value, the film just felt a bit dull and sort of boring. I can see how this movie would have impressed a lot of people who first viewed it when it came out. But watching a movie that came out when I wasn't even born, it just fell short of my expectation. This film is far from being a bad movie, it was actually good but I just felt that it was a bit overrated. The title of the movie is ""Alien"", but the audience don't even get to see the alien all that much, well besides that there is little to no tension and most of the scenes are just a group of truckers in space that decides to go investigating in till they come across a unpleasant discovery and investigate some more, but none of it was intense or gripping. Although there are very few scenes of the actual alien, I get the feeling that they went that direction to add more fright, but didn't really work for me. A lot of the scenes were about the crew trying to find out what the alien is capable of. The movie also goes in a direction where you just don't care for the crew that is trying to survive. It was probably a phenomenal movie of it's time and did a lot for the sci-fi horror genre, but I ain't going to jump on the bandwagon and say this movie is the best in the genre.7.2/10","

"Alien","CalRhys","4 March 2019","Tonight I got the chance to view the perennial sci-fi horror classic in all its glory on the big screen, celebrating 40 years since its inception, and my god does it stand the test of time.Derek Vanlint cinematography is masterful to say the least, perfectly embodying the elements of horror through utilising claustrophobic camerawork and a bleak blue and grey colour palette, however, it's his use of lighting that truly captures the chilling overtones. Shafts of light seep in through vent grates, puncturing the smoky atmosphere in abundance, strobe lighting creates a sense of agitation as the creature hunts the crew members one by one, whilst flurries of neon blue and red shimmers ground it to its science fiction roots.The sound, or lack of, further builds unease, with Jerry Goldsmith's humming drone of a score crafting an eerie tension that only erupts when utterly necessary, standing as one of the first films to EFFECTIVELY utilise jump scares. The use of clanging chains and scraping metal highlighting the anxiety being established alongside impressive and colossal sets. The production design is utterly stunning, from the confined corridors of the Nostromo to the vast expanse of the alien world.This film will forever remain an exemplary addition to the sci-fi genre. Gorgeous and terrifying cinematography, a haunting score, immense set design and some brilliant performance from the main cast, that aided in creating one of the greatest female action heroines of all time, upping her game further in Cameron's follow-up action flick. 'Alien' is truly masterful.","

She's a smart, tough as nails character that you can't help but root for her. The art direction, sets, sound, and special effects all come together seamlessly to create a highly atmospheric world that itself is like another character. Of course we can't leave out the monster, who is very menacing and a lot to deal with. I feel like Alien really set the standard for future sci-fi/horror films and held a high degree of influence on subsequent film makers.

"Alien","tsf-1962","19 November 2006","In many ways, the first ""Alien"" can be described as the sordid underbelly of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Instead of pristine white interiors and clean-cut young men in shorts we have the cramped interior of a grimy, smelly cargo ship with a surly and contentious crew. This is as far from the perfect world of ""Star Trek"" as you can get. The men are unshaven, and everyone smokes, drinks, and uses bad language. Tom Skerritt as the captain does little to inspire confidence, and the only person who knows what she's doing is Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who ironically becomes the only survivor, launching Sigourney Weaver's career as a star and becoming the first female action hero in film history (unless one counts Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz."") It's interesting how the imagery of this film influenced later science fiction, particularly the series ""Red Dwarf."" In terms of plots, ""Alien"" follows the general outline of the classic slasher film ""Halloween,"" with Ripley in the Jamie Lee Curtis role. The alien creature is still probably the most repulsive monster in movie history; unlike ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" or ""E.T. The Extraterrestrial,"" this is a first encounter that is anything but joyous.","

"Alien","one9eighty","4 February 2019","In space, nobody can hear you scream. While on route home, the crew of the Nostromo commercial spaceship pick up an apparent distress signal from a nearby moon, which they are duty bound to investigate. Upon investigation it turns out that the distress signal was actually a warning, but it's too late, as one of the investigating party is attacked by a creature of unknown origins. They try to make a hasty getaway but things are already too late as they've let something alien onto their spaceship.This visionary Ridley Scott film is an absolute classic which crosses genres so easily - It's part Sci-Fi, part Horror, part Thriller, with a lot of action and drama to boot. It's delivered with style and substance making it not just look amazing, but the technology and science behind it too stands strong. A testament to the quality of both the story and delivery on screen is that it has stood strong for from the 1970's and is still recognised some 40/50 years later as an absolute masterpiece of cinema. It's spawned sequels, prequels, comics, games, comics, and fan memorabilia/merchandise.Starring Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto, Helen Horton - and let's not forget Sigourney Weaver - of who it made an absolute icon of film the acting in this is top class. On the subject of Weaver's performance, not only did she deliver a brilliant performance she also goes against cinema convention as the tough, no-nonsense hero of the film where most conventional films would have had a male lead instead. The way they come across, there is no outright leader, there is no star, and there isn't a go-to person - they are all fragile, average joe's who are living on the edge and could be killed off without easily. They are ordinary people who are doing the best they can and surviving while living in fear. Kudos to Scott for actively encouraging the cast to ad-lib certain moments, it gave real authenticity to the performances. In addition, the way he interacted with them really provided an additional layer of emotion - off-screen they were reported to have been encouraged to annoy each other, so that when the cameras were rolling the audience would pick up on the tension. The cast help to give an un-easy feel to the film which is littered with haunting and daunting scenery - making the prospect of the future something more industrial and hardworking. There are times where it feels like the crew is working in some dirty and sweaty industrial factory or prison rather than what the media has perceived as the clean and cool future of space travel in the future. Using the confines of the spaceship as a playground there is no escape from the alien which is hunting them down one by one. The alien is brilliant; it's a fine mix of puppetry, live action and model - which is has haunted film goers now for decades. Hat's off to H.R.Giger for the artistic concepts, it was this film that got me interested in his art work and I've never regretted it. Designing the alien as a non-human humanoid makes the creature but familiar and unfamiliar at the same time - a real creature of nightmares. The elongated head, the jaw, the violent stabbing tongue, no eyes - it's something that humans could have evolved into rather than what we are now, in an alternative reality. One of the things that make it so menacing is its soulless, chaotic and violent approach to hunting. There is no sense to its targeting; it kills because that's what it does. If it doesn't kill you outright it impregnates its host, and then you are on a count-down until you get torn apart from the inside while an alien spawn uses your body like a battery. The Alien, while being the titular vehicle to the film, isn't the sole source of horror and tension in the film - it doesn't appear until after an hour and then only has about 5mins screen time - no, as mentioned, the environment and people stuck in the environment create their own tension as survival feels almost inconceivable, but the score sets the tension up wonderfully too. So much work and effort has gone into every aspect of the film that it's a masterclass; from the directing, to the writing (Dan O'Bannon & Ronald Shusett), to the acting, to the art and design (by Moebius, Chris Foss and Swiss surrealist artist H.R.Giger) - all on point.If it isn't obvious from the passionate write up I have given this, I love this film. It may not have been successfully received in the 70's (some saying it was ""Jaws"" or ""Friday the 13th"" in space) - but by the time I watched this in my childhood it was something that stayed with me. I'd recommend everybody to watch this film at least once as this really is a pivot movie in the history of film and the evolution of genre defying art mediums. 10 out of 10.","

Now, it wants Earth!"" - Dr Blaire (""The Thing"") ""If the sales are good, we'll make another."" - Ridley ScottRidley Scott directs ""Alien"". A haunted house tale, the film watches as the blue-collar crew of the space-freighter Nostromo are systematically killed by a mysterious alien. This alien, slimy and phallic, functions as a kind of roving penis, a reproductive machine which exists only to rape, inseminate and reproduce.Much of the film finds an astronaut called Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) being menaced by both the biomechanical horror of the creature, and the cold inhumanity of a certain, very 1970s corporatism (epitomized in the film by scheming computers, duplicitous robots and traitorous companies). Ripley's softer, feminine instincts are repeatedly conspired against in the ""Alien"" franchise. This has led to Scott's film being labelled ""feminist"". It's not. Ripley merely reprises your typical damsel-in-distress role, stripping down to her panties, fleeing secreting penises and choking on phallic Playboy magazines, all for the audience. By the franchise's end, she would become the alien queen; the source of the beasts.As is now well known, the film's sets and creature designs were inspired by both Swiss designer H.R. Giger and ""Heavy Metal"" artist Mobius. Their visions, coupled to Ridley Scott's own elaborate storyboards, were responsible for ""Alien's"" budget being graciously tripled by the film's producers. The money men saw a hit on their hands. ""Jaws 2"" became the highest grossing sequel the year before.The film's tone mixes cinema verite, classy Kubrickian camera work and B movie peek-a-boos. It was one of several films to bring the venereal horror of Giallo splatter cinema into the mainstream. Despite a strong start, though, ""Alien"" gets increasingly predictable. The film differs from other slasher movies only in the way it makes overt the sexual undercurrents bed-rocking the violence of its siblings. Dripping with post-coital atmosphere, Scott's set pieces are staged as literal rapes and overt intergalactic sex sessions, making explicit the unconscious of other slasher movies, with their maulings, penetrations and blood orgasms. And as with most slasher movies, Scott's characters exist only to be killed. They behave stupidly throughout and are thinly sketched.Though the 1960s and 70s were seen as cinema's liberative, post-studio era, the period's permissiveness had the opposite effect and quickly spawned an increasingly rigid film industry. One sees this most clearly with the ""horror classics"" of the 1970s, most of which were redecorated B movies of the past, only now with A-list budgets, newfandangled gore and modern special effects. These films pandered to the audience's basest instincts, pandered to the audience's most self aggrandising understanding of itself, but they raked in big cash and offered the possibility of incessant sequels, so all was fine; the model works, so it procreates. Today virtually all Hollywood movies are B movies, retro, or exploitation films glossed up in glitz. And as their goal is to tap into increasingly harder highs, and as anything over a pg12 rating is now viewed as being too niche (or ""demographically conservative"" in producer speak), one eventually ends up with schizophrenic horror movies like Ridley Scott's own ""Prometheus"", which simultaneously tries to recapture the shocks of the past (Caesarean sections/abortions replacing ""chest births"") whilst also being bloodless and sanitised. You know. For kids, gore hounds and nostalgic old timers all at once.Most of the ""classics"" of 1970s horror ""updated"" or ""dressed up"" their predecessors. Spielberg's ""Jaws"", for example, borrows the score and various scenes/shots from ""Creature From The Black Lagoon"", whilst Cameron's ""Aliens"" climaxes with the ending to ""Them!"". Ridley Scott's predecessors are Ford's ""The Lost Patrol"", Hawks' ""The Thing"", and horror schlock like ""Fiend Without a Face"", and ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space"". The film's narrative structure, which tricks you into thinking its a tale about men, before turning a female astronaut into its central hero, recalls ""Psycho"" and Hooper's ""Chainsaw Massacre"".Old B movies, though, are Scott's chief inspiration, particularly Mario Bava's underrated ""Planet of the Vampires"", which also features a space crew responding to a distress signal, landing on an alien planet, exploring a derelict ship, finding giant alien skeletons and coming under attack from monsters. Scott's horse-shoe alien ship is also Bava's, as are his smoky, rocky planet surfaces, shots of helmets next to flight chairs, alien climates, alien interiors and flame thrower guns. Scott's big set piece, in which his crew stumble across the giant skeleton of an ancient alien, even recalls an identical scene in Bava's flick. Elsewhere Scott's face hugging critters recall the creatures of ""Fiend Without a Face"", and his last act, with air ducts, ventilation shaft encounters and a climax in which the alien is blown out an airlock, recalls ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space"", another film in which astronauts respond to distress signals and explore alien derelicts. Scott would deny the influence of ""Planet of the Vampires"" for many years, but seems to have finally admitted it with ""Prometheus"". In addition to other similarities, Prometheus' crew are unmistakeably wearing the skintight suits of Bava's own astronauts.8/10 – Worth multiple viewings.","

I didn't care once about what was going to happen to them. I was just praying they all died and the film ended an hour before it was supposed to. The film wasn't remotely suspenseful or engaging.

Because this film broke several horror paradigms, such as that women are always powerless, or that horror couldn't be more subjective and calm, and so on. The originality of this film is huge, making a wave of horror films that are inspired here.As I mentioned, the movie is subjective, it uses your mind and your creativity, so you can make your own guess as to what Alien is entirely like. It uses the most primitive human fear, which is the fear of the unknown, and because of that, it takes a longer time for the alien to appear in the plot. For some this is bad, for others not so much, for me it is sensational.In addition to primitive terror, the screenwriters still found time and space to make very interesting criticisms and allegories, such as that the crew (men) who were abused by FaceHugger so that the Alien will be born, or the criticism of capitalism and corporations who care only for profit and not for the workers.This movie has tremendous importance for the movie industry in general, not just for science fiction and horror. His precise decisions that fill the film with qualities, made new directors and screenwriters inspired by it.

In a slow build horror builds on horror, and then the deaths start.The entire film used no CGI, just standard special effects although you only see them 2-3 times in the whole film.The entire cast burned the nature of each character into the memory, and simply by great acting, great storyline and dialogue, and superlative direction.Unlike most modern films with ""Just a bit more excess"" CGI, and blaring music throughout, this film relies on the story and the people telling it.It's hard to believe it's over 40 years since I first watched this, and I sat transfixed for the last 2 hours watching it again for the umpteenth time, .

The execution of this really simple plot is where this movie shines.Most of it takes place on a giant spaceship but the ship feels empty and dark and has a million places for a bad guy to hide so the tension is high. Even during the big showdown it still feels like everything is slow and drawn out to really build tension.I can't think of anything I don't like about this movie, other than the horror of it kind of sticks with you but would totally recommend to anyone who likes horror or sci fi. Don't let it's age fool you.","

"Alien","skeen-69248","16 April 2017","At the end of the day, Alien is now roughly almost 40 years old. 40 years is a long time, and we've seen cinema evolve drastically over that period, yet Alien retains everything it had back in 1979.Everything from the atmosphere, the long shots, the slow build-ups, the creature design, the characters, the plot twist, I could go on. It really does become difficult to find flaws in this movie. Granted some of the FX are pretty dated now, but you have to remember how revolutionary they were back in the day.Alien is a masterclass in sci-fi horror, far and few films can claim the level of superiority that Ridley Scott's masterpiece still holds.","

"Alien","onepotato2","4 March 2008","When I first saw this with a friend around 1983, we fired it up, and after a while she took a phone call and came back 20 minutes later, ""What did I miss?"" she asked. ""...nothing!"" I responded. Truly, nothing had actually happened in 20 minutes.This is an unusually slow-moving movie. Contrary to arguments voiced here, movies were definitely paced faster than this at the time. (Except maybe Solaris and 2001) Yes, that's right, in 1983 we already thought this was slow. This is the movies major problem. It has only mood, production design, and a couple of scares. It's slow in the wrong parts and quick where it should be more developed. It takes 40 minutes to locate the distressed ship, which introduces the conflict, and 15 minutes near the end is devoted to the self-destruct sequence, and what's left over (the plot - killing everybody) is perfunctory and still dull somehow. 5 minutes for Harry Dean Stanton to look for a cat? A long self destruct sequence starts, an attempt is made to reverse it, then it goes ahead anyway. The reversal effort does nothing but increase the running time. Once on board the Sulaco, the alien spends a lot of time mugging from his perch in some pipes. It's destroyed about four seconds after it frees itself; a wasted opportunity. I just watched it again to see if I needed to reassess; there was no need. I completely honor it's achievement of changing sci-fi movies, but structurally it's bare. Characters are vaguely sketched in. Ad-libbed dialogue around the meal-table would have been a swell place to deepen the characters, not keep the language inaudible and trifling. It has no ideas. If you provide no ideas to think about, pacing is critical. Cameron was a better director for this type of thing as he proved with the superior sequel. This is reputed to be the first time blue collar workers are shown in space. Perhaps trying to look casual in space, Tom Skerrit is deliberately low-key and contributes to the films lethargy. Yaphett Koto receives the dumbest expository line in the script (""Ash is a ROBOT?"") Yes, we're all about 3 minutes ahead of you there. Ridley Scott has an eye for detail, but he's just the wrong director for horror. It's just too arty to be scary. When Dallas gets it, there's a shock appearance of the alien who makes the ""Ta-daaaaa!"" gesture with his hands which is unintentionally funny, not scary. There's enough bad direction like that to kill the mood. And a cat is a lame reason (& a lousy device) to continually leave your co-workers to die. On top of that the design for these DVD menus is very irritating. Gigers design for the majestic, evil alien is still astonishing.","

"Alien","MaxBorg89","12 May 2007","Almost thirty years have passed since Alien made its first appearance, becoming an instant classic, opening the doors of Hollywood to director Ridley Scott and starting one of the best-known franchises to have ever graced the screen. Thirty years, and the movie is still as fresh, brilliant and scary as it was back in 1979, perhaps because no other film (with the exception of James Cameron's superb sequel, Aliens) has yet been able to match its claustrophobic mood and moments of sheer, unadulterated dread.Of course, by now everyone knows what the alien looks like, but when he inadvertently started the series Scott made the wise decision of keeping it mostly unseen: the ghastly creature is almost never shown in its entirety, preferring to lurk in the shadows as the unaware human characters gradually realize what's happening. In fact, the first half-hour or so of the film is spent to introduce the protagonists and get a better understanding of their relationship, which, as in many other similarly themed movies, is tense. Justifiably, since the nine astronauts have been together on the Nostromo for a lot of time, sent on a mission in outer space by a mysterious Company. Suddenly, they receive a distress signal from a remote planet and decide to take a better look at what's going on. Within hours, they will regret it. Hopefully, the people watching this film won't.Some parts of the movie could be dismissed as clichés, but the truth is, of course, that Alien actually CREATED many of the stereotypes of recent sci-fi (crew being wiped out from within, no one out there to help them, et cetera). Plus, the film is so solid and consistently captivating it is hard to stop and think of possible leaks in the plot. As a pure exercise is suspense and horror, Alien has no rivals, Scott's clever use of lighting and camera angles ensuring the claustrophobia and tension never drop. He is also helped in this by choosing to keep the villainous creature in the dark most of the time, perfectly adhering to the old principle of ""the less you show, the better"" (something Spielberg and Carpenter applied with equal success on Jaws and Halloween). And while the characters may have been developed better in the sequels, what we have here is enough to qualify as convincing and likable, thanks mainly to a spot-on cast: Sigourney Weaver, a complete unknown at the time, is mesmerizing in the role that made her an A-lister and finally put an end to the Hollywood tradition of women being no good other than when it comes to running and screaming. The supporting cast is every bit as strong, with John Hurt (who is the unsung hero of the entire franchise's most celebrated sequence) and Ian Holm in particular adding to the film's unsettling atmosphere.Briefly, one of the Top 10 greatest science-fiction/horror (it fits equally well on either list) films ever, and, Blade Runner and Gladiator aside, the high point of Ridley Scott's career. Just remember: on Earth, people CAN hear you scream...","

"Alien","dognemur","19 October 2022","A lot of people describe the suspense and terror that this movie demonstrates as its best characteristic, which is certainly valid. It is intense, and can be held up as one of the greatest horror movies of all time, easily. I would argue, beyond that, that it's one of the greatest movies of all time in general. It's basically perfect sci-fi; with absolutely gorgeous sci-fi design and brilliant execution, with beautiful sets and effects that hold up today. It has great dramatic moments and even some twists. None of the sequels, to me, hold a candle to this.It feels a bit like Blade Runner, with its borderline avant-garde use of quiet moments. However, unlike Blade Runner (which is just as strong a film) this movie uses its nebulous setting and ominous set design, music, lighting, and sound design to instill a deep, troubling fear in the audience.","

"Alien","maue-19674","16 May 2019","It is quite a few years since I first sat down to watch 'Alien', my anticipations being that it would be like any other Sci-Fi film of the period. To say that this film changed my life may be a slight overstatement but it certainly changed the way I view Film and Cinema! The opening titles (accompanied by Jerry Goldsmith's thoroughly creepy score) give the tone of what is to come. The crew of a commercial star freighter are awakened by their onboard computer as it has picked up a 'signal' from a small planetoid in a nearby system. Obliged by Company Rules to investigate, they set down and find a completely non-human ship crashed and (apparently) derelict. One of the crew descends into the bowels of the ship - to be confronted by a chamber full of ovoid shapes...unwisely he decides to take a closer look...and things spiral out of control from that point....What makes this Film SO great is that it is almost shot in a semi-documentary style - the shaky camera footage on the helmet cams, the dark foreboding atmosphere and the quite slow pace - all are deliberately and slowly drawing the audience in. Alien sometimes comes close to being a 'Science Fiction Art-Film' - and so it is - in a way. The designs are extraordinary - with Swiss Artist H.R. Giger designing the absolutely frightening ALIEN of the title. Scott's visuals are astounding and introduced him to Hollywood as a real talent. The pace picks up through the second half of the film - the effects were all done 'in camera' - no CGI here - just old fashioned film making. Scott ensures you never quite see the creature, which adds to the menace and sense that you are trapped in there with it. The sequence in the air shafts is superb - a gripping piece of cinema, as is Alien's most celebrated scene - the 'birth' of the monster.We tend to forget now that, back in 1979, it was not the norm to have a 'female hero' - Scott deliberately went and made 'Ripley' a female to set against audience expectations - thus when Captain Dallas falls, the audience were now wondering what to expect. Everything about this production is first rate and Ridley Scott has never really been better (unless you compare with Blade Runner). Sigourney Weaver - a then unknown - shows that strong female leads are the future.
It is difficult to underestimate the impact of this Film on Science Fiction in general - this really WAS the first time that a Sci-Fi Film was shot, designed and delivered in a totally realistic way - which is why audiences believed it and were scared to hell. This Film so impressed me that I started to watch other Genres, older cinema - it gave me the 'gateway' into the history of Film. It will forever be may most treasured cinematic experience...If you have never seen this - prepare to shocked, scared and blown away with some of the most stunning visuals in this Genre.","

"Alien","Eric_Cubed","25 June 2015","How can this movie not get 10 stars? It baffles me. In context, this one came out in 1979. 19 F----ng 79. And it still stands up awesomely today. Let us first investigate the Ash. When did we first realize he was an android? When the milky fluid came spurting from him. Although he was often ""collating"" we never really suspected until his head was bashed in proper. What an incredible character Ian Holmes created. And those little pre-exercise jiggles he did. We just thought he was a bit off, certainly not a robot. And Ripley, a strong female lead. And though the scenes of her in her panties were anti-feminist, she still was the lone survivor, who kicked the Alien out of the airlock. She kicked a-- and everyone will always remember that, especially James Cameron. And what about Tom Skerritt? As captain, he always left the science decision to Ash, as he was instructed to do by the company. He felt he was, ""just the captain,"" though he did ignore basic contamination protocols by letting Caine in with the Alien attached to his face. His acting was perfect, a man who only knows the job he is hired for, compartmentalized, weak, and yet ultimately courageous in his decision to go after the Alien. And Parker and Brett were perfect. Pay attention to how their camaraderie is condensed into a few beautiful scenes. Ridley Scott should be credited for this, as we really get to know the friendship between them quite quickly (as James Cameron does in Aliens). Lambert is great in her nervousness. This is as good an any movie can get, a masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, sorry for the spoilers, but rent as soon as possible, it is a piece of American Cinematic History.","

"Alien","manisimmati","8 March 2018","In terms of sci-fi horror, Ridley Scott's »Alien« is as good as it gets. As many people have pointed out, the story is basically B-movie stuff: a spooky monster haunts some hapless people, only this time they're in space. Scott stages the rather simple plot like an arthouse flick, beginning with the slick and lifeless introduction to the space ship Nostromo. The atmosphere is unbelievably tense throughout the movie: from the industrial Nostromo, the stormy planet V-426 to the phallic Alien designed by H. R. Giger. In many ways, »Alien« is the antithesis to Stanley Kubrick's »2001: A Space Odyssey«, the most megalomaniac movie ever conceived. Ridley Scott shows us that space travel won't be about philosophical self-discovery. It will be about dirty, senseless work. Of course, there are also some gender issues at stake here. Sigourney Weaever as Ellen Ripley might be most badass last girl in movie history - and maybe the first female action star that is not reduced to her womanhood. If »Alien« has one problem, it's the fact that it betrays its B-movie roots. There is a wannabe-deep scene near the end of the movie that feels affixed, as if Ridley Scott wanted to reconcile the intellectuals in the movie theater. That wasn't necessary at all. Still, if you're into stylish and evocative sci-fi, horror or sci-fi horror, you need to watch »Alien«. Man, what am I talking about? If you're into movies at all, you need to watch this flick.","

"Alien","claszdsburrogato","3 September 2023","Alien was released 44 years ago and still impresses with its technical quality. The scenarios and visual effects are perfect, managing to be better than many of the current films that have much more technology to create something better. The Alien has a wonderful and iconic look, making him one of the most striking villains in cinema, even though he doesn't appear all the time. Not showing up much is what makes him so awesome. The tension scenes work really well because you don't know what he's capable of and you can't see him. The characters are well developed and the fights between them are very natural. There is only one moment where the visual effects are not so good, but that does not negate all the aesthetic beauty and writing of the film. Perhaps this is the best science fiction in cinema.","

"Alien","FiendishDramaturgy","22 January 2005","I'll start this off by saying that this review is not for the theatrical version, but the extended Director's Cut from the Quadrilogy Collection.While this movie is some 25 years old, it hardly feels dated at all, aside from the actors appearing so young in comparison to now. Also, aside from ""Gorillas In The Mist,"" this is some of the best work of Sigourney Weaver's career.Ridley Scott, although relatively new to the cinematic scene at this time with only two theatrical directions under his belt, was prolific in direction through the media of television. While these are two totally different animals, he demonstrated a thorough understanding of the way things should be done. He introduces his characters and builds their development in a nice, easy flow without boring his audience with what can sometimes be a tedious demonstration of humanity.He introduces his story, gives you a sketchy outline through dialog clever in that it does provide that outline and backdrop of the situation at hand while eluding to what will be coming up, without giving it to you on a silver platter. Obscurity (hiding things in the shadows) is a virtue when building suspense, and he proves with Alien that, even at this early stage of development in his career, he has mastered that phenomenon.As the tension builds, so the story deepens, providing you with highly suspenseful, edge-of-your-seat moments, and some really good scares, as the story itself is strong enough to draw you in.The ""monster"" this time is, as the title would indicate, an Alien, but one the likes of which you've never seen. It is intelligent, bestial, brutal, and yet beautiful. The Alien is born of a pod lovingly laid by its Queen Mother, then reborn by way of a warm-blooded host. Reborn pregnant, it immediately seeks to impregnate another warm-blooded host with its spawn, thereby insuring the proliferation of the Alien species. Very clever writing, dramatic and carefully controlled performances, some excellent effects, and amazing camera work combine to make this a sure sci-fi/horror classic. We knew it would be, as soon as we saw it.It rates an 9/10 from...the Fiend :.","

"Alien","lucasversantvoort","5 May 2015","In 1979, a little film hit theatres. You might have heard of it, it's called Alien. Ever seen it? You probably should. It's pretty good. Seriously, what am I talking about? It's Alien. Everyone has either seen or heard of this movie. Now, I don't see Ridley Scott as the master filmmaker some perceive him to be, but there are times when he got it very right. Alien is one of those times.In deep space, a ship called the Nostromo carrying mineral ore and seven crewmembers is bound for Earth. The crew are in hypersleep and all is well, that is until the ship's computer registers a signal from a distant planet. The ship has automatically changed its course and awoken the crew. Though no one is particularly excited—everyone assumed they'd be on Earth by now—one of the crewmembers informs them they're contractually bound to investigate any signal. They arrive at the planet. Three of the crewmembers (Kane, Dallas and Lambert) don their suits and head out to explore the planet. They arrive to discover a mysterious spacecraft in the shape of a horseshoe. They enter and eventually discover a large hall with countless eggs all guarded by a force field hovering just above them. Then, one of the eggs opens and a crab-like alien, spewing acid, burns through Kane's helmet and latches onto his face. They bring him back to the Nostromo and the rest is history.What made this film revolutionary at the time was its brilliant combination of the claustrophobia of space with the concept of a haunted house horror show. A well-executed haunted house thriller is scary enough, but the addition of space means there's literally no escape. It's actually a simple, but really effective concept and Alien executes it to claustrophobic perfection.Indeed, it's the atmosphere and the handling of the alien itself that makes Alien such a classic. Regarding the alien, Scott and co applied the Jaws principle: refrain from showing the monster completely. What you can't see or understand is the basis of all horror. Because the film deliberately only shows parts of the alien who's often veiled in shadow, it makes him/she/it all the more horrifying. It's telling that one of the deleted scenes featured a full body-shot of the alien crawling towards someone. It looked downright ridiculous. Indeed, the importance of only showing glimpses of the monster in horror films cannot be overstated. It's something Aliens tried to do as well by showing shots of the aliens and quickly cutting away, but alas, you can only show aliens exploding so often before they lose their shock value. The idea of not showing the alien also extends to the script which doesn't explain the origin of the alien, how the spacecraft got there, what the space jockey was doing there, etc. Because we have zero information on it, we can't understand it and because we can't understand it, our imagination kicks in. Sometimes, leaving plot elements unexplained and letting the viewers' minds do all the work is for the better. Also, the atmosphere in Alien is absolutely wonderful. Even by today's standards, this film looks incredible and it was made in 1979with a budget of only 11 million dollars. All three of Alien's sequels have moments where you're subtly aware that something looks fake or was made on a computer screen. In Alien, I can't remember a single moment where the film looked anything less than stunning. Whether it's H.R. Giger's wonderfully disgusting alien design or the ship's interiors, it's all wonderfully realized and immersive.This film also marked the birth of one of film's most famous action heroines, Ripley. While she would only be recognized as such in Cameron's Aliens, it's interesting to see in retrospect how Alien laid the foundation. What I like the most is that at first, Ripley is just another crew member. Scott doesn't emphasize her as the main character. But when Kane is brought back with a face hugger firmly attached to his thinking cap, Ripley takes center stage by refusing Kane and the others entry back on the ship because it's in violation of protocol. The fact that Ash overrides the door and gives them access anyway, thus ignoring Ripley, is irrelevant. This is the first time Ripley assumes the position of a leader. Her decision might be inhumane, but it's exactly those types of hard decisions that leaders must make. As time goes on and the alien escapes, Ripley starts assuming this role more and more. It's very well done.Special mention goes to maestro Jerry Goldsmith's score. The production was a troubled one for Goldsmith: some of his music for Freud (1962) was used for the dripping acid scene, a classical piece replaced his end credits music and all but one cue survived the editing process unscathed. Despite all this, the score itself is a classic in the horror genre. Particularly impressive is how 'alien' much of the score sounds, and how much of this is achieved not through electronics, but the skillful manipulation of instruments or the application of real ones. He used actual whistling, an echoplex, wind machines, a didgeridoo, conch shells, a serpent, the list goes on. Despite all this experimentation, Goldsmith still manages to inject the score with some cohesion by carefully applying and manipulating a few themes, the main theme of course being the most recognizable and quasi-romantic. Director Scott however was hesitant to start the film with a broad, but mysterious romantic theme and replaced it with the famous hollow sound that opened the film back in 1979. Goldsmith sought to create a musical journey, while Scott was thinking in individual cues. Both sides of the argument are understandable however.Alien stands as one of the great achievements in cinematic horror. Not only did it introduce one of film's greatest heroines, but it combined sci-fi, the vast isolation of space and the haunted house concept to produce a singular horror experience.","

"Alien","estebangonzalez10","19 June 2012","¨It's got a wonderful defense mechanism. You don't dare kill it.¨ Ridley Scott has had a great career and made several great films, but Alien, only his second film, may arguably be his best one. In my opinion this is the best horror film of all time due to the dark mood, the claustrophobic atmosphere, and several shocking scenes that continue to have an impact on the horror genre 33 years after its release. I have to admit that I just now got around watching this historic movie after having seen its prequel, Prometheus. I liked Prometheus so much that I knew I had to go back and watch the original film that got the franchise started. Despite having seen the aliens in the horrific AVP films, I still was shocked and surprised with the scenes and effects in Alien. The visual effects were excellent and it rightfully won an Oscar in that department. I can only imagine how shocking the chest bursting scene must have been for viewers in the late 70's. The scene was masterfully directed by Ridley Scott and it has to be one of the most frightening ones in horror history. It may be the highlight of the movie, but there are also several other shocking moments that make this the perfect sci-fi horror film. I loved the way they managed to build the suspense without showing too much of the alien. The setting was just perfect and the sense of claustrophobia is all over the movie. You knew that at any moment the alien could pop out of nowhere and attack once again. That sense of dread was also built thanks to the suspenseful score. Thousands of horror films have tried to copy a similar format since the release of this perfect movie without reaching the same success.The film takes place sometime in the future as a towing spaceship named Nostromo is on its way back to Earth. There are seven crew members who are in hyper-sleep and aren't expected to wake up until they get home, but unexpectedly the smart computer running the ship, known as ¨Mother, ¨ receives a signal that seems like a distress call from a nearby planet. The crew members are awaken and are informed of the situation by Mother. Despite some initial arguments over them not being a rescue team, the Captain of the vessel, Dallas (Tom Skerritt), decides to land on the planet and once there they discover a wrecked spaceship nearby. Dallas along with his assistant Kane (John Hurt) and crew member Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) get off their ship and enter the wrecked one in search for clues as to who may have sent the distress call while Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Brett (Harry Dean Stanton), Ash (Ian Holm), and Parker (Yaphet Kotto) remain on board of the Nostromo trying to fix some mechanical problems after the rough landing they experienced. Kane, Lambert and Dallas on the other hand discover the fossilized remains of the dead alien pilot on their expedition with a huge hole on his chest. Kane is sent further down the ship where he finds some sort of alien eggs surrounded by a blue mist which seems to be disturbed by his presence. This is where the horror begins as Ripley discovers that the distress call isn't really an SOS call, but a warning.The film has a perfect structure: the science fiction is beautiful taking us to a futuristic world that is well constructed, the visuals are excellent, the editing perfect, the performances are strong, the script is really well written by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett (who later collaborated together for another known sci-fi film: Total Recall), the thrills and scares are plentiful, and there are several shocking moments with a couple of twists. The true star of the film is the alien even though we do not see much of it. The reason he's the star is because the claustrophobic mood of the film makes you dread it can show up at any given moment. These characters are stuck in the spaceship with this evil alien that's killing them off one by one. Not even Sigourney Weaver is the star of this film as she practically gets equal screen time as the rest of the cast. She wasn't a known star at the time, and it was actually this franchise that catapulted her to fame, so no one really knew which characters were really going to survive this horror story as the film had plenty of surprises throughout. I wish I would have been around in 1979 to see what kind of reaction I would of got considering I already have seen the aliens in recent versions, but the fear of the unknown is always much more frightening. I still had a great time with this movie and consider it mandatory viewing for everyone who loves film. Alien is as close to a perfect film as you will ever see.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com","

Once I started reading, I became absorbed by it. My father was right. This was the year the film was released, and at 12, there was no way of going to see it. So I became obsessed with getting to see it. After the film was released, I stumbled upon the photo book The Making Of Alien, and after finally seeing H.R. Giger's creations, I was completely blown away.Alien is a tightrope of tension and fear. It's the most atmospheric movie I have ever seen. All of the cast are solid in their roles. Ridley Scott and crew did an amazing job of recreating H.R.Giger's designs, and Scott's direction is flawless throughout. The set designs inside the Nostromo, and the gritty 'space truckers' feel of the film, add to the realism. Which makes for a great contrast when they finally discover the alien derelict, with it's nasty surprises.John Williams's score is amazing. Suitably dark and bleak, with just a glimmer of hope.So, from a 12 year old's crush, and to finally seeing it a few years later, I can say with ease, Alien is without doubt, my favourite film.Total perfection.","

"Alien","Pramitheus","15 May 2016","I am watching this movie in 2016 and still the practical effects almost made me puke. Ridley Scott's space horror is one for the classics. I have obviously watched many movies with gore and aliens and sometimes both but all of them try to force feed you. The set pieces don't seep in and the audience is made to jump from one gory situation to another. BUT this is Ridley Scott we are talking about. The one who started it all. I actually had watched Prometheus 1st and had a vague idea about the Alien franchise. Now after re-watching Alien I am beginning to connect the dots.The plot is probably known to everyone by now. So just skipping over that. Starting with the direction. The slow paced direction allows you to feel the atmosphere. The situation. It makes you understand the psyche of each of the crew members aboard the Nostromo. You start to care and while watching it I often wished to not get emotionally involved because I knew what was to follow. The face-hugger scenes was much more creepy and disgusting than when the Alien arrives, because the Alien is shown in the dark and mysterious. So the effect of the goriness is only understood when the witnesses arrive but the face-hugger is on screen. It is puke-worthy. The acting was very natural. The lines almost seemed unscripted. The equation between all the crew members was very evident from the beginning. I should seen through the fact that Ash was an android but it was well hinted throughout the film. It is very subtle. So subtle that you are bound to miss . As I said, the pacing is very steady. You'll feel the fear. The set-design is amazing. All in all it was a enjoyable movie. Ridley Scott is the master of space oriented movies.Final warning. IF ANY ASTRONAUT IS READING THIS AND WANTS TO SPACE TRAVEL, DON'T LAND ON UNKNOWN PLANETS","

And you actually care and feel for the main protagonist, along with her cat, and you truly want them to escape alive from the death witch is something unusual for horror movies to do. I just have to say that it's one of my favourite movies of all time.","

"Alien","tfrizzell","26 October 2000","""Alien"" is one of those films that has spawned numerous imitations, but none have come close to the brilliance of their inspiration.  Definitely scary and somewhat difficult to watch, the film deals with an outer-space crew that accidently runs across an unknown organism that is bent on killing everyone.  Sigourney Weaver became a super-star because of this film, but she gets ample support from everyone else.  Tom Skeritt, Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto, Harry Dean Stanton, and John Hurt all do amazing jobs with the material.  Ridley Scott's direction keeps the audience tense and on edge throughout the film's running time.  A really great film from the horror and sci-fi genres.  4 stars out of 5.","

"Alien","kaaffilm","27 March 2023","""Alien"" (1979) is a masterpiece of science fiction horror that has influenced countless films in the genre. Directed by Ridley Scott, the film tells the story of a crew of astronauts on a mining vessel who encounter a deadly extraterrestrial life form on a remote planet. The tension is palpable from the opening shot, and the film's visual design is striking and otherworldly.One of the film's great strengths is the strength of its characters. Sigourney Weaver delivers a powerful performance as Ellen Ripley, the ship's second-in-command who emerges as the film's heroine. The supporting cast is also excellent, with standout performances from Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, and Yaphet Kotto.The film's use of suspense and horror is expertly crafted. The Alien itself is one of the most terrifying creatures in cinema history, with its design by H. R. Giger perfectly capturing the sense of dread and horror that permeates the film. The sense of isolation and helplessness that the characters feel as they are stalked by the creature only adds to the tension.""Alien"" is also notable for its visual effects, which have stood the test of time. The use of practical effects gives the film a sense of realism that CGI-heavy films often lack. The iconic design of the Alien and its spacecraft have become iconic in their own right and have been referenced in countless films since.Overall, ""Alien"" is a masterpiece of science fiction horror that stands the test of time. Its powerful performances, expertly crafted suspense and horror, and striking visual design make it a film that deserves its place in the pantheon of cinema classics.","

"Alien","Silverzero","19 January 2003","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSAm I the ONLY person who didn't like Alien. What was so flawless about it? Here's the plot in a nutshell. Crew of spaceship find alien egg. Bursts out of someones stomache and kills them all one by one until one of them eventually kills it. All that over 117 minutes.There is absolutely no music. A crew member spends ten minutes looking for a cat, (not expecting an alien to kill him) and guess what happens. I think it would have been ten times better if it was a little less subtle, quicker to get the point and directed by somebody else. But i'm SUPPOSED to love this film because every critic on the planet does. This is overrated and unworthy of its hype.","

"Alien","Mr-Fusion","17 June 2012","It's kinda funny, when you get right down to it, ""Alien"" is just a guy in a monster suit terrorizing a bunch of space truckers. But oh, man, what they do with that premise. It's a revered classic for good reason; it draws you right in and traps you aboard the cramped confines of a dingy space freighter while a horrific twin-jawed best kills off the crew one by one. But this thing just oozes atmosphere, from the Nostromo's claustrophobic corridors to the workaday lives of these characters. ""Alien"" is cold, frightening and introduces one of the great movie monsters. Supreme craftsmanship, all the way.But seriously, if there's any doubt as to the impact of this movie, look up the '79 trailer on YouTube. It was a genius marketing campaign (""In space, no one can hear you scream"" . . . there's no topping that), and it's got to be the most effective trailer I've ever laid eyes on.8/10","

A must-watch classic. The disconcerting atmosphere after the Facehugger falls off Kane's face, leading up to the disturbing, explosive reveal (and the actual appearance) of the Chestburster Xenomorph, is executed brilliantly and is one of the most memorable, fear-inducing, shocking scenes in cinematic history.","

"Alien","MovieAddict2016","31 October 2003","Minor SpoilersI attended a screening of ""Alien: The Director's Cut"" not four hours ago, and not four hours ago I was thrilled. I knew that I was going to get a chance to witness one of the most atmospheric and thrilling films of all time--with added footage. Fans who picked up the DVD (now out of print to make way for the new ""Alien Quadrilogy"") may have already seen a few of the deleted segments, while other fans who didn't, and are waiting on the promised quadrilogy to be released next year, will be enthralled. This film doesn't feature a wealth of new footage such as ""Apocalypse Now Redux,"" scenes that could damage its flow, but instead gives us scenes that click together a bit more. One of these is when Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) finds Dallas (Tom Skerritt) attached to the wall with alien mucus seen later in ""Aliens."" It doesn't make sense to feature it in the original cut, and director Ridley Scott was smart for deleting it when the film hit theaters back in 1979. It doesn't really make much sense, and stops the gripping flow of the ending when Ripley is racing to get to the escape shuttle. It causes people to think, What? and then they start letting their minds wander. But now that we have seen ""Aliens,"" and understand the significance of the mucus (sounds funny, huh?), it makes complete sense. This is the fan's version.Plus, it's fun to get to see the movie on the big screen for those who didn't twenty-four years ago.The plot (as if you didn't know it by now): A mining ship in the future named the Nostromo, carrying seven passengers back to earth, stops in its course to locate an SOS beacon on a distant planet, which may, or may not, actually be a warning signal as opposed to a distress beacon--too late to find out, since they land on the planet and one of the investigating crew members, Kane (John Hurt), gets attacked by a strange alien creature that attaches itself to his face and doesn't let go.The ship's captain, Dallas, hauls him into the ship's lab, where he is looked over by the ship's scientist, Ash (Ian Holm), who takes an odd affection to the creature that bothers Ripley, the second in command. The technician, Parker (Yaphet Kotto), doesn't like any of this either, and their suspicions reach a maximum when Kane wakes up from his sleep, the alien unattached from his face, and proceeds to eat irregularly. Later that night, back in their course to earth, a small alien bursts from Kane's stomach at dinner. The alien escapes into the depths of the ship. Search parties commence but the alien starts to grow more fierce and terrifying as the film treads on--soon it's a man-eating set of teeth bent on killing the lot of them.Atmosphere is part of what makes ""Alien"" the terrifying nail-biter it is. This isn't a routine horror flick that jumps through all the hoops--it's original to a certain degree. Its inspiration comes from earlier films but it improves upon them all for the most part. From its opening shots to its final, it is eerie, moody, and scary. To show millions of aliens abounding from hidden crevices would be typical--the fear of ""Alien"" lies in the anticipation of the jump, or the startle. We wait, and wait, and suddenly something leaps at the screen. It's not the alien. The alien is in front of the thing that jumped. Our heart stops and then jolts again. Forget pumping volts of electricity through dead people--place them in front of this and their hearts will pound once again.James Cameron's sequel ""Aliens"" (1986) is often considered the better of the series, in terms of excitement and aliens themselves. But ""Alien,"" like the movie ""Signs"" (2002), isn't really about aliens. The film ""Aliens"" is terrific--but so is ""Alien,"" as its central idea is too unnerve the audience through bumps and jolts. Not through blood and guts. Depends on what your personal preferences are--startles or explosions? I appreciate and enjoy both.Ridley Scott knows how to evoke wonder and magnificence from his shots. The opening sequence that shows the exterior of the Nostromo and then dissolves to the interior, crawling along the shafts as we wait for something scary to happen and then forget as we are wowed by the movement and visuals, is a fine example of the art of filmmaking and not the filmmaking itself. Cameron is one of my favorite directors. Scott, when given the right material, can turn out wonders. ""Alien"" is his crowning achievement alongside the dark 1982 classic ""Bladerunner,"" another sci-fi feast for the eyes and mind. I wasn't a fan of ""Gladiator,"" but let's not bring that up, shall we?""Alien"" may seem tame by today's standards. But this isn't a film that wants to be another mindless blood and guts extravaganza. This is a smart horror film, one that is as involving as it visually magnificent, one that is as amazing as it is terrifying. This is horror at its finest. And if you didn't get to see it on the big screen last time around, now is your chance to get a glance at what you've been missing all these years.Notes: The new ""Alien: Director's Cut"" version features over three minutes of never-before-seen sequences, as well as restored prints and a newly remixed surround-sound track. Attached to the director's release of the film is also the first teaser trailer for next year's ""Alien vs. Predator.""5/5 stars for the 1979 original and 2003 Director's Cut.John Ulmer","

"Alien","Hitchcoc","22 March 2006","This is the ultimate fright fest. From the planet these junk dealers come to, to the appearance of the monster and subsequent events, this is one wild ride. First of all, there is a bleakness and an eeriness. These people are on a salvage mission, trying to bring things back to sell. They have been victimized by their own bosses. When they go down to the planet, they have not been told what lies there. There is a darkness to everything. It isn't the romantic explorer thing of a Star Trek or the use of a sophisticated starship. This is a big space barge. When the man is brought back from the surface with that thing on his face, we know that there is something coming. The scene following is one of the most startling and disgusting I've ever seen (in a positive way). The alien is a true threat, dripping corrosive venom and poison blood, terrorizing the ship, leaving one person to combat it. If there is a more claustrophobic, terrifying movie than this, I'd like to know what it is. The other Alien movies don't quite make the grade because they draw on way too much of the same thing and it seems forced.","

Of the network okayed just about everything from plotlines, especially to set dec, character models, music.Everything about 2 screams ""for sale"" and to me (for example Alien 3 - was that produced, developed and released with a modicum of the standard that Alien was treated to?) while it's the better action movie, Alien is the better movie.Just like Hitchcock, this movie didn't just change horror/sci-fi forever but also modern, big budget blockbusters entirely and is so timeless and genre defining that I'm not even a horror fan and this is one of my favorites.This movie speaks more in the action, the setting and the arc than in the dialog, the music rivals anything by Williams or any of the other greats, and this still remains one of the best, undated looking movies ever, it could have been released today, tomorrow, or 30 years from now.","

"Alien","mark.waltz","2 September 2020","Who would have thought that just two years after ""Star Wars"" would come a film about outer space that would immediately grasped its audience and create a franchise of sequels? ""Star Wars"" gave us Carrie Fisher. ""Alien"" gives us Sigourney Weaver. Even though Tom Skerritt is the top-billed star, it is Weaver whom you'll be watching all the way through, and while she certainly has a legacy outside of this, it is obvious that say her name in fifty years, an alien will be the film that people remember her for.A group of astronauts and an Android are on a mission in space when they are alerted that their assistance is needed on another ship that is claiming SOS. After debating whether or not they should go, they head out to help, and realize that the SOS was actually a warning. When they get aboard, they discover that the ship has been taken over by some sort of Horrid creature who aligns itself onto one of the astronauts faces, and the acidic like droppings from it become deadly. Another astronaut all of a sudden has a spasm with a creature popping out of his chest, and before long, they are fighting for their lives.Among the crew are humans Veronica Cartwright and John Hurt and android Ian Holm, and while perch has several memorable moments, unfortunately, his role is nothing more than a cameo. Home, as the Android, is unforgettable with or without body attached to head. But Weaver is definitely the star, commanding and strong, yet brave and fearless, and certainly somebody I would want on my side during a dangerous predicament like this!While you get to know the characters, if not so much from their words as it is from their actions, because the script does what it needs to do without being too wordy. The special effects are sensationail and the direction is tense and sheer perfection. Ridley Scott creates a tense atmosphere that never lets up, aided by Weaver's cat who gives a little warnings whenever the alien is around. There are plenty of moments that will make you jump, but that is followed by laughter from the situation. Who would think that a film like this could have a sequel every bit as gripping, and for some, even better? But this is where it started, and it is a film that will stand the test of time long after this review has faded into the list of many others written about it.","

"Alien","saikatsamanta","7 July 2021","Ridley Scott's Masterpiece which popularised the Space Horror subgenre, is a stifling atmospheric horror from start to finish. Its about a crew aboard a cargo spaceship who were awakened from cryo-sleep to investigate a remote signal & unknowingly returned with something sinister on their ship. The Art Design, Practical Effects & Makeup done in this film is the stuff of legends & even after 40 years it can amaze the viewers. The screenplay is unique too as Scott subverts all of the common horror tropes, & we get one shock after another. The film gave us one of Movie History's most iconic Monsters, the Xenomorph & it is kept hidden most of the time as the director uses its unknown presence as the source of anxiety and fear among the crew. The camerawork is iconic too with shots worthy of film school studies. Sigourney Weaver as headstrong Ripley is a Breakout Performer. A Timeless Horror Classic worth a part of any Collection.","

"Alien","anders-rock","29 May 2011","Every second of this movie gives me the shivers. Even in the slow moving first half the atmosphere is so ominous and creepy and the acting so excellent that I'm never bored. The movie builds up the tension so masterfully you're on the edge of your seat all the time. I've heard some people say that the effects are dated to which I will answer: No not really. The monster is a man in a suit with some mechanics in the head and while there are a few shots where it's movements seem a little stiff we rarely see it and when we do it's only for a short duration and it actually in many ways looks more real than most CGI creatures of today. The artwork and design is one of the reasons this movie holds up so well to me. The ship looks appropriately old and battered up and the alien itself is pure genius. This movie just keeps thrilling me every time I watch it.","

"Alien","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","21 April 2008","This film is quite popular, at least judging from it's rating(as I'm writing this, it's placed #50 on the top 250 list). I realize that this was probably a benchmark for special effects when it was made, but now the effects seem incredibly dated(which they don't, at the very least to the same extent, in pieces from the same period, best example being Star Wars), and many scenes seem clichéd today, even though I suppose they were fresh when it was made. I guess the main problem with the thing is that it doesn't age well, but I also think it lacks too much in both character development and humor... just a little comic relief would have made the nearly two hours go by so much easier(for me, this merely gets slower and less watchable with each repeated viewing). Attempts at making you laugh fall flat on their faces. There are far more unintentional laughs to be had, at various corny and odd things(why does this have so much weird stuff in it, and why do the people who love it just accept that?). More often than not, to me(and one person I know who *loves* these movies), this just ends up being too hard to take seriously. I'm willing to entertain the theory that Ridley Scott's stuff just isn't for me, I've yet to be amazed by him. For how much sheer, unsynthesized acting talent this has, the players have next to nothing to work with(they do turn in fine performances). Nonetheless, the film does manage to scare me and provide some shocks, even though I've seen this and the other films at least three times before. The film manages to establish a pretty nicely done, spooky atmosphere that lasts for most of the film, despite its shortcomings and the very formulaic ending. The plot isn't bad, and it takes off almost immediately, keeping you fairly interested. The characters are so-so, though there aren't any really startlingly poorly written ones. The creature effects are decent enough, and they do not fail to impress at least a little. The editing has moments that are just strange, the cinematography has reasonably little to offer. Props to whoever ensured that the realism was kept at such a high level. The sets, and in general the production design, is all well-done(some is nothing short of breathtaking). I've read one suggestion that stories set where this is and similar are more straining on the audience, and they are more likely to be bored, in spite of the potential talent possessed by those who put it together... I'm inclined to agree. There is some language, and violence as well as gore is also featured herein. I have to admit, I see this as valuable more as an introduction to the world of the title creature, and find, for example, Cameron's expansion of, and further adventure within, it considerably more worthwhile. Don't expect a masterpiece, and prepare to test your patience, especially if you've seen many of these films. The ""Director's Cut""(though he feels the original fits that bill better... hey, at least it's not as bad as the alternate name, ""Extended Version"", which is even a misnomer as it *shortens* the overall length) adds a few things, which you may find worth a look, if you like it(not that there are that many, I count five chapters with additions in the DVD's own breakdown). The commentary track is an OK enough listen, some of the stuff said is cool to hear. I recommend it to fans of alien-type science fiction, and fans of sci-fi horror films(as such, it's good enough) in general. I suggest any possible Alien-fans to-be to start with this film, rather than any of the other films. The series works best in correct order. 7/10","

"Alien","elijahbutler-40119","19 February 2018","I remember when I first saw Alien as a teenager. This movie scared me to the core and it's STILL scary and very suspenseful to this very day! I love movies from all genres and horror is one of my favorite genres in cinema history and when it comes to horror movies, Alien is DEFINITELY one of the greatest ones of all time! Ridley Scott's direction in Alien has a HIGHLY suspenseful feel throughout the entire film and it somewhat makes you feel disturbed and uncomfortable and that's one of the reasons why this film is so iconic! Sigourney Weaver as Ripley takes this ENTIRE film from opening to finish! She was EXCELLENT in this film and this is definitely one of the greatest roles I've seen in ANY movie which makes this one of the greatest roles in cinema history! All of the other characters such as Brett, Parker, Kane, Dallas, Ash and Lambert played by Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto, John Hurt, Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm, and Veronica Cartwright were really interesting and engaging characters throughout the entire run time of the film and the acting in Alien is ABSOLUTELY mind-blowing which was another reason on why this movie is insanely scary! Now let's talk about the creature in Alien known as The Xenomorph, this thing is just.................ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING AND AWESOME! The Xenomorph has to be one of the scariest things I've ever seen in ANY movie in my entire life! Ridley Scott also decided to not show this creature for the majority of the film which was a little more terrifying, because you never really expect or know when this thing is going to come or what it's going to do to the crew or what the creature looks like when you first watch Alien and it is just GENIUS AND FANTASTIC SUSPENSE FILM-MAKING! Something else that I also love about Alien is of course the iconic chest burst scene! Most of you who have seen Alien know what I'm talking about, but when they were shooting the chest burst scene, the actors were 100% unaware of what was going to come out of John Hurt's chest so when the Xenomorph burst out of his chest, their reactions were legit and real and that's just so awesome! This movie also holds one of the GREATEST jumpscares in cinema history when Dallas is in the air shafts and out of NOWHERE he runs into the Xenomorph and you don't actually see him die by it, but you see it appear and you just hear this EXTREMELY LOUD screeching sound and static sounds in the background and every time I watch this movie, that jumpscare STILL sends chills down my spine and it's a jumpscare done right! There's also something else I absolutely love about Alien when the crew finds out that Ash was a robot that was sent by the company to send this life form back to earth and it is a VERY clever twist that was HIGHLY unexpected and it's all done by the genius mind of Scott and the tension he brings in this film! Alien is one of my all time favorite movies and it has stood the test of time VERY SUCCESSFULLY and it has inspired many film-makers and it will continue to do that, because it's a timeless masterpiece and a classic film and Alien DEFINITELY gets a 10/10!","

"Alien","Woodyanders","18 November 2007","There are several reasons why this remarkably taut, scary and effective science fiction/horror hybrid holds up so well to this very day. 1.) The premise ingeniously mixes elements from two separate, yet compatible genres into a strong and satisfying synthesis. The futuristic outer space setting is pure sci-fi, but the grotesque monster, ghastly gore and spooky mood are sheer gut-wrenching horror all the way. 2.) The plausibly drab and bleak depiction of a frightfully possible future. There's nothing slick or shiny about the future shown in this picture. It's truly grim and grimy, with the grungy set design, grubby costumes and rundown looking spaceship all contributing to one fascinatingly credible version of a future that seems just around the corner. The all-powerful company's cold assessment of the crew as expendable isn't too far removed from the world we currently live in -- a world in which greed and money take precedent over the basic worth ascribed to everyday human life. 3.) The gradual pace. While there are some folks who take issue with the methodically slow pace, said pace nonetheless is crucial to developing the almost unbearably substantial amount of suspense that really kicks into harrowing overdrive once the creature gets lose on the ship. It's the meticulous build-up of the first half which gives the second half of the film its considerable nerve-wracking impact and potency. 4.) The infamous ""chest-burster"" scene. It's so supremely well-timed and staged, with highly believable mixed reactions from everyone involved in the scene. 5.) The uniformly superlative acting from a top-notch cast. Sigourney Weaver positively shines in her break-out star-making role as tough sole survivor Ripley, with stellar support from Tom Skerritt, Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm, John Hurt, Veronica Cartwright, and the always terrific Harry Dean Stanton. 6.) Jerry Goldsmith's exceptional score. Ace composer Goldsmith chimes in with one of his most brilliantly spare and chilling scores ever. 7.) The thoroughly convincing warts'n'all human characters. The way the well-drawn characters bicker and interact with each other rings completely true throughout. 8.) The strikingly gloomy cinematography by Derek Vanlint gives this feature a supremely powerful dark'n'shadowy atmospheric look. 9.) The still quite sound and cogent special effects. Done prior to CGI, those miniatures have an organic quality to them that's extremely persuasive. 10.) That hideously vile, nasty and downright creepy alien itself. Sure, it's just a guy in a suit, but wow does that suit seem incredibly genuine and lifelike. 11.) Ridley Scott's faultless direction never wavers from start to finish, keeping the absorbing story on track while delivering plenty of jolts and cranking up the clammy claustrophobic tension to the often exhilarating ninth degree. Add all these sterling factors together and the net result is a simply spectacular motion picture that's wholly deserving of its classic status.","

Face hugging, chest popping and outright carnage ensue, as one by one the crew is left to fend for themselves.This film goes down as a classic, and it well should have. A giant in the sci-fi world directed this (Ridley Scott, ""Blade Runner"") and it was written by Dan O'Bannon (who also adapted ""Total Recall"" from Philip K. Dick and wrote/directed the horror classic ""Return of the Living Dead""). And a cast consisting of Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm? Amazing! What makes this film great is the real sense of being alone it leaves you with. Even when the crew is grouped together, they know they're trapped millions of miles from home. They must fight to survive, no running possible. The enemy changes and remains unknown, and even one of the crew may not be on their side.This film contains the iconic ""chest-popping scene"", which was pretty cool. Granted, after seeing ""Spaceballs"" you might be let down by the version in this movie, but it's still pretty memorable. The face-huggers are also creepy, if you can imagine what that must be like to have a slimy, acid-blooded creature suctioned on your face, dropping eggs. Nasty! The film goes from sci-fi to horror and back again, mixing the two together in way that's rarely successful (although I would give a nod to ""Event Horizon"" for being a fine exception). They implement the ""final girl"" scenario well. I don't mean to ruin the plot for anyone, but not many of the crew survive and one of them is Sigourney Weaver (which I suppose is obvious since she's in all the sequels). She knows how to be tough, even if she's not exactly pretty while doing it. (I think horror fans crave attractive women more than science fiction fans do, if this film is any evidence.) My only complaint with this film is the alien suit, which seemed too rubbery and human-like. Luckily, the director was smart and saved the reveal until much later in the movie and kept it to a minimum. Sometimes the unseen is scarier than the seen, especially if you aren't able to make the monster as scary as you planned (which is fixed in future sequels).If you haven't seen this one, see it. It sets the bar for all future science fiction films, particularly ones involving hostile alien life. I don't know if a film in the genre can be made any more without somehow paying their respects to this one.","

"Alien","ryanskywalker-87402","20 May 2017","One of the most original, suspenseful & terrifying films you're ever going to come across, Ridley Scott's breakthrough feature is a masterful blend of imagination, art direction, set design, special effects, unsettling score, perfect cast, terrific performances & quality narration, and is an extraordinary achievement in the genre of both horror & science-fiction which today is universally hailed as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time.Alien follows a seven members crew en-route to Earth on board a huge commercial ship when their journey is interrupted by what appears to be a distress signal from a desolate planet. The crew lands to investigate but discovers a deadly life form which breeds within a human host. And so begins the horror... the horror of a highly aggressive extra-terrestrial creature which begins to stalk & kill them one by one.Ingeniously directed by Ridley Scott, it's his brilliant use of atmospheric visuals & breathtaking details plus strong emphasis on realism over movie heroics that provides Alien an ageless appeal. Cleverly penned down by Dan O'Bannon, his vision of the monster and the futuristic world he sets the plot in is nothing short of breathtaking. Also, H.R. Giger's design of the monster is an exceptional feat in itself, for it is truly a unique & original fusion of insect, man & machine.Cinematography & editing is carried out amazingly well and integrates effortlessly with other aspects of this film. The cast works together as a team with great maturity and it was pleasing to see each & every character getting equal importance as it provided viewers a bunch of very believable & convincing individuals. And in a cast that comprises of Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm & John Hurt, it is Weaver who ends up leaving the most lasting impression on the canvas.But the most remarkable thing about Alien is its persistent attention on suspense over mindless gore & graphic kills and of course, its smart pacing as well that separates it from typical slasher films. Alien actually takes its time & waits until the viewers are fully immersed into its world and is at its scariest when nothing is happening as Scott allows plenty of space for our imaginations to run wild and, with little help from Jerry Goldsmith's tense score, turns almost every frame into a potential nightmare scenario.On an overall scale, by bringing together the silence of 2001: A Space Odyssey to create suspense and the horror of Jaws by not showing but not ruling out the presence of the creature either, Alien succeeds in creating a very dark, moody & unique atmosphere that constantly provides a feeling of uneasiness throughout its runtime. A genre-defining masterpiece, a genuine fright classic, and an unprecedented fusion of art, science & horror, Alien is a distillation of everything that scares us in the movies. One hundred percent recommended","

"Alien","saymaraza","5 June 2016","Alien is one of the first movies directed by legendary 'Ridley Scott' (Blade Runner, Gladiator) The film is a classic in the making. When i first heard about this movie i was around 10 years old, obviously too young to watch the movie, now i am 17 and i have watched it for the first time, now twice i enjoyed it so much. This is honestly one of the best Sci-Fi movies of the 70s, probably is my favourite Sci Fi movie of the 70s, and one of the best of all time. The Sequel 'Aliens' (1986) was directed by James Cameron, another one of my favourite directors. Director of 'The Terminator' (1984) which stands as my favourite Sci-Fi movie of all time. The reason i didn't want to see Alien when i was younger, was because i always felt scared of the Alien, i used to have horrific nightmares of them just thinking about them. When i went to Disney world, i have always loved Movies, so i decided to visit a Movie ride, the Alien suddenly popped out of the ceiling, of course it was only plastic, but looked real enough. So i had always been too scared to watch the Movie. I didn't know what i was missing out! As i watched it i didn't know what i was worrying about. It's very different to watching it on Screen than seeing for real. I am nearly 18 now, so i am not really scared of anything anymore, i would definitely go back to Disney and try out that ride again, just to see if it still scares me, I think now i've finally seen the movie i appreciate now that it's not real, and i find it interesting than scary now more than anything, because it feels like I'm in the movie. When it comes to Ridley Scott director 'Prometheus' (2012) a prequel to Alien, that wasn't very scary at all, it was more of a mystery than a Sci-Fi/ Horror i thought. Alien is deifinitely a classic in the making, Don't miss Ridley Scott's masterpiece Alien!","

"Alien","hall895","6 April 2013","Upon its initial release critical reaction to Alien was mixed to negative. One notable review described it as an empty bag of tricks. One critic dismissed it as an overblown B-movie. Another called it deeply dislikeable. Then a funny thing happened. Audiences saw the film and liked it. The film became a big success. It wasn't long before the film was being touted as a classic of its genre. Critics who had initially panned the film went back and wrote entirely new reviews praising it. The film was now beyond criticism. Nobody would dare admit they did not love it. Truth is the critics had it right the first time. This film is just not very good.Alien is meant to be a scary monster movie but the scares certainly don't come fast and furious. This film takes a long, long time setting itself up. Director Ridley Scott tries to build suspense. But this slow build drags on far too long for the film's good. Tension and intrigue drain away, boredom sets in. The film is often described as ""Jaws in space"" in that it's a monster movie in which we see very little of the monster. But where Steven Spielberg kept Jaws crackling along Scott's film gets terribly bogged down. Jaws also benefited from compelling characters. No such luck with Alien. Sigourney Weaver has some presence to her playing the key role of Ripley. But that character doesn't really spark to life until very late in the film. The rest of the cast has very little to do. A boring group of characters prone to doing stupid things. Like searching for a cat instead of, you know, escaping the giant murderous Alien. There are some notably fine actors here, including John Hurt and Ian Holm. But the script fails them. The characters never inspire much feeling in you at all, giving you little reason to care about their fate. There is very little story here, no character development whatsoever. A late reveal of one character's background proves more silly than shocking. The film has a memorable moment or two. But one or two moments in a two-hour film aren't nearly enough. This monster movie is monstrously overrated.","

"Alien","Asentiff2004","25 December 2013","Deep in space, the commercial vessel the Nostromo receives an emergency distress signal from an unexplored planet. After having arrived and conducted a search for survivors the crew returns home only to discover in the most terrifying of ways that a deadly and seemingly invincible bio-form has joined them, and is slowly hunting them one by one.Terrifyingly claustrophobic is a brilliant way to describe this movie. The tension escalates as the movie plays its course. The pacing is brilliant from master filmmaker Ridley Scott. Sigourney Weaver in her most iconic role does a brilliant job portraying Ripley. The feeling of being closed off, the feeling of the Nostromo being a giant claustrophobic maze in which the viewer desperately wishes to escape make this one of the greatest and most terrifying films of its generation. With shocking surprises and twists throughout including the iconic dinner scene that still to this day can be shocking for a first time viewer. The score of the fim only adds to the tension and seemingly silent but deadly tension that continues to mount as the film plays on, only at its conclusion does the viewer finally feel as though they may take a deep breath. Spawning 3 sequels, 2 cross over films, and a loosely tied prequel, Alien has proved to not only resonate these many years later but maintain its popularity within the mytho's of classic American cinema.","

Like 2001, the images are unforgettable, a cinema experience you can become completely immersed in.The late 70's, my youth, were in many ways were an incredible rebirth of science fiction and horror cinema, and it's worth noting how Alien in a sense bookended Lucas' fantasy reinvention of sci-fi with Star Wars. Ridley Scott's great vision in bringing all these elements together in Alien and Blade Runner literally changed the course of fantasy films alongside Lucas'.Many comments here also focus on comparing Alien to Aliens, which is ridiculous..It's simple...Alien is a horror masterpiece, and Aliens is a brilliantly executed action film using Alien as it's inspiration.If you don't like Alien, you don't like films...it's that brilliant.","

"Alien","Lechuguilla","29 December 2008","A rat in the attic is a good metaphor for this unimaginative ""sci-fi"" flick from director Ridley Scott. The human crew aboard a Hollywood-conceived spacecraft diddle and dawdle. They chitchat about this and that; they eat; they smoke; they look at outdated computer screens; they emit petty frustrations. Finally, after interminable plot filler, and after our space voyagers have displayed requisite incompetence (what would film stories be without incompetence?), ET shows up on-board, less cosmic than sleazy, like something the cat drug in from a b-grade horror flick. Now, our beleaguered ... and incompetent ... crew promptly sets forth to deal with the menace.But our spacecraft-trapped rat has vanished into the woodwork, probably to escape the crew's incompetence and/or all the hammy acting. Where did ET go? Behind the stove? Under the frig? Inside the computer? Nope, he's in the attic. Quick, fumigate. Oops, too late. The house is condemned.I'm constantly amazed how easily sci-fi fans can be satisfied by conventional, stodgy stories, and cheesy, overbearing special effects. Where in this film is a sense of the cosmic? Where is the originality? Where is the science fiction in all of this?","

However they stumble into a weird spaceship with lots of eggs until one of them accidentally brings a creature on board that will soon be born, a nightmare will soon follow Ripley and her crew.A truly terrifying and magnificent movie that has stood the test of time for many years since it's release in 1979. A highly influential mix of Science Fiction and Horror from Ridley Scott who gave us the masterpiece ""Blade Runner"" for audiences and critics alike praised this motion picture as a visceral and startling roller-coaster ride. The screenplay by Roland Shussett and Dan O'Bannon is quite smart and original borrowing some influence by 50's Sci-fi and EC Comics, Jerry Goldsmith's score is chilling at his best. Sigourney Weaver as Ripley as created a Sci-fi icon of herself for being one of the best heroines to hit the screen, i also love the dark atmosphere that makes it almost a character to the movie much as Ripley and the crew are especially the main star which is the coolest monster to hit Sci-fi cinema known as the Alien. H.R. Giger designed both the monster and the design of the film. There's even memorable moments of graphic gore such as the chestburster which disturbed audiences yet it still does and has been spoofed many times.It became a pop culture phenomenon spawning three sequels with ""Aliens"" almost being better then this as the best of the franchise and a true must see.","

"Alien","emms75","11 April 2004","Alien is a chilling suspense thriller set in space. Directed in 1978 by Ridley Scott, this film is important to me, as I admire the techniques used in order to generate a response in the viewer.Back in 1978, the director couldn't rely upon today's modern digital effects to grab the audience's attention. Instead, he relies upon techniques such as camera angles, a clever set design, and a superb soundtrack to slowly build tension and create feelings of fear, vulnerability and intimidation within the audience.It is at least half an hour into the film before the audience are aware of the extent of the horrors that follow. Until then, the uncertainty of not knowing exactly what we should be afraid of only adds to the tension. The eventual release of the tension, which has gradually built up, inevitably has more impact.The film is set in a time and place unknown to us. However there are several ideas in the film which we can recognise and relate to, making the story believable, therefore more frightening.For example, the idea of travelling far in space for the purposes of a mining expedition is something which the viewer could accept as likely to be happening in the future. Also, the seven characters on board the ship have an obvious class system, something which we can all relate to in any work environment.These are some of the qualities which make Alien so popular, making it an inspiring piece of film making.","

"Alien","Cinemaniac1984","11 August 2015","In 1979, Alien was released and was a box office hit thanks to Ridley Scott's brilliant direction and a small cast including a little known actress named Sigourney Weaver who would establish herself as one of the most successful actresses in Hollywood. The story is kept simple and there are plenty of non-stop nail biting moments that would be guaranteed to keep audiences on edge and to scare them out of their seats. Alien certainly lives up to its now famous tagline ""In space no one can hear you scream"". The original movie poster is brilliantly kept simple too.Alien takes place in the near future where a commercial spaceship Nostromo is returning to the earth, intercepts a distress SOS from a distant planet. The seven-member crew of Nostromo is made up of Dallas (Tom Skerritt), Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Lambert (Veronica Cartwright), Brett (Harry Dean Stanton), John Hurt (Kane), Ash (Ian Holm), and Parker (Yaphet Kotto). All seven crew members are woken up from their hypersleep and the spaceship subsequently descends on the planet. While exploring the planet, the crew discovers a strange derelict spaceship and thousands of alien eggs. One of the eggs hatches and attacks Kane with a facehugger attaching itself to Kane's face rendering him unconscious. Kane is brought on board Nostromo and the crew depart the unknown planet. The facehugger then disappears and Kane awakens, seemingly fully recovered. All is well until Kane starts to convulse violently during dinner with the crew and a tiny alien bursts from his chest. The crew look on in horror as Kane dies and the alien escapes into the spaceship. The remaining crew members must work together to locate and trap the alien, but it is not as easy as it seems when the alien grows larger and starts killing off the crew members one by one.Everything is excellent about Alien. Without a doubt this is one of Ridley Scott's best movies besides Blade Runner (1982), Gladiator (2000), and Black Hawk Down (2001). The then-little known cast are excellent and it's great to see Sigourney Weaver go on to enjoy a stellar career. H.R. Geiger's visual effects are excellent (despite being a bit dated now) and it was excellent to see him being rewarded for his efforts with a well deserved Academy Award for visual effects. Jerry Goldsmith's atmospheric soundtrack was also top notch and his brilliant work is sadly missed.Who would have thought Alien would go on to leave a legacy by following up with three sequels and establishing Sigourney Weaver's Ripley as one of the greatest female action heroes of all time. Aliens (1986) turns everything up to 11 by expanding on the first movie by going bigger, better and louder. Unfortunately Alien 3 (1992) and Alien: Resurrection (1997) fail to reach the same heights as the first two movies.Alien is a timeless science fiction horror classic that has firmly placed itself as one of the best movies of all time. I still enjoy watching Alien for what it is.9/10.","

"Alien","hou-3","17 January 2015","After all, surely it is just a haunted house or lost platoon movie taken to the extreme? No, it's much more. In Alien everything works to best effect, and that was not simply luck. In Giger's astonishing alien, cold metallic smoothness is synergised with unmitigated, super-swift killing and intelligent cunning, representing an unprecedentedly fearsome enemy. The bickering relationships among the crew set up an atmosphere of unease and vulnerability that the malign intent of the Company readily exploits. And the descent into chaos and terror is orchestrated with devilish finesse through the brilliant coordination of lighting, music and adroit camera work. For me this is Scott's Citizen Kane - it all falls into place. It is his main claim to greatness.","

"Alien","jazzest","31 January 2005","The very reason of the huge and continuing success of this 25-year-old sci-fi classic may be the simplicity in its storytelling and its art direction, which has seemingly made the film timeless and universal.A simple And-Then-There-Were-None type of story has no era-related influence from the late 70s, while many sci-fi films tend to mirror the world at the time they are made. Staged mostly in a closed environment inside a spaceship and briefly on an unknown planet far from Earth, the film practically has no connection to any particular culture.The designs of aliens' colony on the planet and of the alien by H. R. Giger must have been remarkably cutting-edge back in the time; for contemporary eyes, they look rather simply beautiful. The title design at the opening is also appropriately simple: Green LED-like lights turn on one by one to form the letters of ""ALIEN.""The film doesn't look old at all after 25 years and probably will never do. This is one of great examples that simplicity attains eternity.","

Where your imagination completes the picture and your brain delivers the jolt of horror! Alien is one such movie! I saw it first at 15 and was scared out of my wits, and it really was not until my 20s that I could look at the whole movie without goosebumps.Now, after watching the movie perhaps 100 times, I am still attracted to it and drawn into it. But my perception of it changes. Having seen it today again on TV, I realized the really positive message was that the CAT has survived :) The Nostromo crew is dead and the ship destroyed, a colony would be set up on the planet and destroyed again, Ellen Ripley loses her daughter and ultimately her life, but the Weyaland-Yutani Corporation prospers. Everything sucks except the cat makes it! And that is good :)Bottom line: Cat 1 - Alien 0","

"Alien","charchuk","24 October 2006","Probably the first sci-fi/horror, and definitely the best. By limiting the number of characters, and enclosing them in a confined space, Scott hikes up the tension without having to resort to cheap thrills or buckets of gore (though the chest-bursting scene is still terrifyingly effective). Each of the characters is fairly well developed, and it's unclear at the start who will live and who will not, which also upps the suspense. The production design is really cool, and doesn't look dated at all, and the alien creature itself is quite original and still scary. Great performances too, and a good script, making this much more than just a monster flick.","

From the timeless effects, to the fantastic score, to the perfect use of suspense, this film just completely gripped me and never let go from start to finish. The use of atmosphere is probably my favourite element. There were so many scenes where more or less nothing happened that I was still on the edge of my seat throughout. The performances were great, particularly the badass Sigourney Weaver, and the creature design was surprisingly good for a film made in 1979. The story is simple, but it means that it can be fleshed out further, and leads for some great moments of suspense. Oh yeah, and the chestburster scene was just incredible to watch. My one issue is the reveal that Ash is literally a robot? It came completely out of left field and just felt weirdly unnecessary to me. But overall, a fantastic experience, and one I'd definitely recommend.Also I know this has been said before but who the hell brought the cat into space?","

I must first say that much of this adoration comes from the beautifully sinister score by Mr. Goldsmith, and, as I very recently learned, a piece from ""Romance"" by Howard Hanson. This became Ripley's theme of defeating the Alien at the end of the film. But I also love Sigourney Weaver, who will always be Ripley. If they dare to remake this film, I won't go see it. We need to learn to quit ""needing"" to remake everything and accept the classics as they are, products of their time. I am sick to death of CGI. This film is a real classic, directed by the innovative Ridley Scott, and its cast includes Tom Skerrit as the temperamental and not-so- sensible Capt. Dallas, John Hurt as the tragic Kane, Veronica Cartwright as yes, the weepy but understandably terrified Lambert, Harry Dean Stanton as Brett, a mechanic of few words, Ian Holm as Ash, the science officer, the incomparable Yaphet Kotto as Parker, who was somewhat of a comic relief for a while here, and then went on to an amazing dramatic career, and last but not least, Jonesy (I'm a cat lover, OK?)The story is simple...a space ""towtruck"" called the Nostromo is ""lured"" by a signal to a small planet to investigate. They wouldn't bother. They are only a commercial civilian vessel after all, but their employers have ordered them to investigate via ""Mother"" their ship's computer. You know the rest, or if you don't, you need to watch this peerless film. Then follow it up with ALIENS.

"Alien","sebbystone1","22 December 2015","With the exceptions of Gladiator and the Martian, Ridley Scott hasn't made a good film in far too long. I would never call myself a fan of Blade Runner, but Alien shows Ridley Scott as his finest.The claustrophobic, psycho-sexual tension masterpiece that is Alien is a classic of Sci-Fi. It sparked a franchise including three sequels, two cross overs, and a prequel. It is in dozens of top 100 sci fi movies lists, and was listed as Empire's 33rd greatest movie of all time. Does the highest rated horror movie on IMDb deserve its praise?Short answer: yes. Alien does have a handful of short-comings, such as some implausibilities including technology (the worst self destruct system of all time). These count for nearly naught. You won't be terrified by this movie, but it doesn't deny that this gripping film remains to be the perfect sci fi-horror film. While some good sci-fi horror films exist, such as Predator, The Thing and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, none have been able to replicate this movie's atmosphere and tension. Whether its the infamous Chestburster sequence, Dallas' death in the vents, or Lambert's off screen violation, there is no doubt that this psycho-sexual, claustrophobic, star wars turned R horror movie will be remembered by myself as Ridley Scott's greatest contribution to mankind.

"Alien","rmax304823","12 July 2003","""Alien"" follows the general conventions established by John Ford's ""The Lost Patrol,"" his highly influential 1934 work.  It's been redone any number of times as a war movie or a Western.  Now it's in outer space.  The sub-genre looks something like this.  A small contingent of people -- a mixed group -- in an isolated situation are confronted with a rarely seen enemy who strikes out of the darkness.  There is no way to fight back effectively.  One by one, the group members are picked off, beginning with the leader.  This shifts the responsibility to the next in command, who turns out to be the lone survivor or, sometimes, the last to sacrifice himself or herself for the sake of the mission.But it's hard to recognize the basic plot under all the gloss.  This movie was something of a shocker on its release, and introduced a lot of innovations into SF movies.  For instance, in all earlier movies in which a team lands on an alien astronomical body there is no wind.  Here, there is a howling gale.  This may not seem like much, stated so baldly, but no one had thought of it before, although it's long been known that planets like Jupiter have atmospheres that are in a state of constant turbulence.
The monster was also a vehicle for a new, slimier conception of raw evil. This one is no Gill Man or furry pet with teeth.  This thing is positively reptilian in its detestability.  And it doesn't just ""do away"" with its victims.  It begins by incorporating every revolting image from our worst nightmares -- a scaly muscular skate-like creature that plasters itself to John Hurt's face and embeds itself in his innards in order to plant a seed of some sort, which later develops into a juvenile that, in a famous scene, bursts out of Hurt's chest during a shipboard dinner that didn't look very appetizing anyway.  This was the first movie that could really turn one's stomach, what with jelly-like substances and gooey sounds.  Everything connected with the alien looks as if it belongs under a rock in a jungle. The f/x are outstanding.  If they look a little tired today it's only because they've been so often imitated.The performances are professional all the way down the line.  Sigourney Weaver has a strangely boney face and tiny mouth, but she's believable and turns in a good performance, especially for a Stanford graduate.  Her first name was plucked by her father from F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, ""The Great Gatsby,"" one of my faves.  Tom Skerrit isn't around that long, but he is so likably easy-going that we hate to see him disappear from the plot early on. John Hurt is a fine actor.  He was my supporting player in the art-theater classic, ""From the Hip.""  He's never done less than a first-rate job. Whatever happened to him?  Veronica Cartwright exudes vulnerability.  She needs protection as an adult as much as she did when she was a child in ""The Birds.""  In an interview she revealed that when the juvenile creature first appeared everyone laughed at it because it looked so much like a penis. Ian Holm as the robot is suitably cold.  He's a good Shakespearian too. Yaphet Koto is an earthy comforting presence -- while he lasts.  The alien itself doesn't have much screen time but makes the most of it, dripping all over with what looks like saliva.  It reminded me of a boatswain's mate I once had the misfortune to serve under.There are a couple of curious things that shouldn't get more than footnotes. The music is almost all taken from Howard Hanson, a moody and underrated composer, and effectively evokes distance, darkness, and the mystery associated with them.  There are also a couple of references to Joseph Conrad thrown in (eg., the name of the ship is the Nostromo) for reasons I can't figure out.  Maybe the writers or the director just happened to like Conrad.  It should also be noted that Sigourney Weaver's figure, while not bursting with femininity, is sleek and smooth and looks designed for underwater swimming.If you haven't seen this, you should probably try to.  The gross factor isn't very high, viewed from today's perspective, so if that's what you're looking for, rent Carpenter's regurgitative newer version of ""The Thing"" or something.","

"Alien","Seb_3","14 August 2021","I watched this masterpiece for the first time in 2021 and I was left in awe as the credits rolled. I absolutely loved this film, despite it being released almost 4 decades ago! The acting holds up wonderfully and everyone does an absolutely amazing job, the cinematography was beautiful even by todays standards and the sound design and music was scary, but beautiful and really helped build a certain atmosphere and a sense of complete isolation, which is where the movie shines. You feel trapped with the crew knowing that around the next corner It could be waiting for its next pray, this feeling is what makes Alien such a nail biting, edge of your seat experience.There are a few things that were of course held back by the technology of its time, but these are just extremely small nit picks that doesn't come close to ruining the movie in the slightest. There were a few times where the sound effects or visual effects really put me off, but these scenes only lasting for a couple of minutes. The creature it self and the environments look amazing and even better than I could have hoped for. Everything felt real and the alien looked even more terrifying and realistic than I thought It would. This sparked a franchise and while some of the further installments were great and some of them not so much. Nothing can touch the throne that the original Alien movie has been sitting on for so long. This is still a thrilling and nail biting adventure, that will leave you at the edge of your seat many years later. This is truly a timeless masterpiece.10/10.","

Alien feels authentic realistic that this could happen in the near future with space travel. It builds great suspense and you dont know when the Alien will show up. The movie has several good surprises. Also many great scenes (especially since it was part of the recent defunct WDW ride). Wonderful cinematic movie that deserves to be near the top of all time horror suspense movies.","

The movie is consistently tense, the effects hold up tremendously well and the characters are all likeable. Things are constantly changing and the movie is consistently fun. I can't say much about this film without entering spoilers but truly everything about this film is amazing.

"Alien","Horst_In_Translation","31 July 2017","Here we have the 1979 two-hour film Alien and this one is the beginning of a franchise that is still going on today, again with Ridley Scott in charge, the man who also directed this original movie. It is all about what happens when an alien creature ends up on a spaceship full of scientists in the future. Lets just say that it is not full of scientists anymore at the end. The movie won an Oscar for its special effects and scored another nomination. These days, despite being almost 40 years old (or because of?), it is considered a classic when it comes to combining the horror and sci-fi genres. The most known cast member is certainly lead actress Sigourney Weaver and she keeps moving more and more into the center of it all the longer the film goes and there are other pretty well-known actors in the relatively small cast here. Still, this is at no point an actors' movie. It is all about the creature, the fight for survival and of course the technical aspects (both visually and audibly). And last but not least about the scare factor: I think they did a pretty good job here in elevating this film beyond mediocre jump scares as the creature attacks sometimes when you don't expect it and does nothing when you do expect it like when the second victim was looking up at the ceiling in search of his cat.Some solid plot twists about crew members and the general plan involving the creature work in the film's favor too. You have to dig deep for flaws, but here and there you find one. Maybe Ripley is sometimes depicted too heroically for a film that definitely tries to go for realism at the very core of it all. I also could have done without the epilogue outside the ship I guess, but I'll accept it for the thrills. Just personal preference though obviously. It was a good watch, but almost top50 films of all times (as here on IMDb) is certainly exaggerated. I will probably check out the James Cameron sequel at some point too, but these two hours were not on a level where I would want to do it immediately. Overall, a thumbs-up though. Certainly worth checking out if you love sci-fi. A lot was done right here and there were certainly scenes that could have gone horribly wrong with less competent people in charge. Lucky for us, they did not. Go see it.","

"Alien","NightmareOnElmStreetFan","3 January 2020","Alien (1979) is a masterclass of terror it is my favorite Sci-Fi horror movie of all time a real classic. A film so terrifying and yet so beautifully done that it demands to be viewed over and over again. The characters are grounded and feel real, the sets are breathtaking (even today), the film feels natural and plausible. But the main reasons to watch the film are for two things: The Alien and the atmosphere. Both make this film, the entire film is full of dread and when one of the most interesting and violating creatures shows up on screen; it is riveting.I can still remember when I first saw Alien back in 1997 as a 13 year old kid, It's scared me back then and still holds up today as one of the best horror films of all time. The direction by Ridley Scott is first rate and the sets and atmopshere are creepy and claustrophobic. The ""chestburster"" scene is brilliant and very effective. Also gotta give a shout out to H.R. Giger who designed those amazing Alien creatures. A must own for any sci-fi or horror fan!!Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley is gorgeous and one of my favorite heroine survivors. The ship for Nostramu is great. The effects and desigen for the creature is wonderful great it is a masterpiece fuly done. this is my favorite horror sci-film to me. One of the most frightening horror masterpieces ever made.I love the characters: Captain Dallas, Ripley, Lambert, Brett, Kane, Ash and Parker. I love the Alien design the costume. Bolaji Badejo as the Alien was great it is really a tragedy and sad because 2 great actors died like Bolaji Badejo and Kevin Peter Hall they both died in the 90's and they both played monster creatures so well. Hall was Predator and Badejo was the Alien they deserve both actors respect and they are missed R.I.P. This was Badejo's only role I wish he would get more movie roles. I miss these actors so much. Veronica Cartwright was great as Lambert I really love her she was sexy. Yaphet Kotto was a bad-ass as Parker. Great practical effect when Parker burn with flamethrower As's remains. That is my favorite scene. Tom Skerritt as Captain Dallas was great and wonderful, his best performance on screen I have ever seen.The movie is master sci-fi classic masterpiece with a horror elements. My problem is the first hour is boring when the crew goes on the desolate planet and they find that empty ship whith a lot of eggs. One of the crew members gets infected and Ripley does not leave the crew inside the ship but Ash opens the gate and lets them in, he does not obey his superior Ripley. By the end we find out that Ash knew what is going on and he was admiring the purity if the Alien. I love the finale and I love the cat Jones, the cat was really trained. The second hour goes fast around and I was more interested in the second hour. It had horror and survival elements I love that.On their voyage home, the crew of the deepspace tug Nostromo investigate a transmission from a desolate planet and discover a mysterious lifeform.Alien (1979) is my favorite horror film, Aliens (1986) is my number 1 favorite horror so I put Aliens (1986) above Alien (1979). To me they are both masterpeices to me. The Nostromo ship is great designed, today the CGI effects are fake, the effects in 1979 were great and excellent.","

"Alien","Rainey-Dawn","30 June 2014","Still one of the creepiest movies in the sci-fi horror category and that deals with contact with space aliens. It is suspenseful, dramatic and mysterious.""Alien"" is the first movie of the film franchise - and, to me, the best in the series. It is the story of how the group of astronauts (most notably Ripley) came into contact with the bioform/alien. The movie has action in it but not nearly as action-packed as the second movie in the series ""Aliens"". I find that the first film (Alien) is a good story.This is definitely a movie for all that love the concept of space aliens and horror films but is also good for mystery lovers as well.9/10","

"Alien","leonsott","23 December 2022","I first watched this film when I was a kid much to my hesitance. The whole time I was terrified but being brave I tried to stick it out.One thing I remember is the Alien itself. Although rarely popping up, I could feel that it was there. The way it moves and the mouth that comes out of its mouth all fueled my nightmares.Recently, I looked at Alien on IMDb and saw that it has a very high rating. I revisited the classic and enjoyed from a more mature perspective. This was before the days of computer visual effects and massive cgi displays and to be honest it looks better.The Alien is terrifying because its a guy in a costume and that is what makes it so real. It moves like a human but it isn't. Another thing I love about this film is that the protagonist played brilliantly by Sigourney Weaver is not your damsel in distress type. She is the hero of the story who carries a sense of masculinity.Of course I need to mention the chestburster scene. When that thing came out of John Hurts chest the first time I saw it I was horrified.I do wish directors look back to films like Alien that don't so heavily rely on computer generated effects and yet are amazing. Films like star wars (original) or even the Lord of the rings don't have flashy visual effects which is what makes them brilliant films.9/10 Brilliant film and you should give it a watch.","

"Alien","Red-Barracuda","19 August 2012","I guess in hindsight you can see why Alien was such a sure-fire winner back in 1979. It took important elements of two of the most successful blockbusters of that time. It combined the science fiction of Star Wars with the relentless killer monster of Jaws and put them into a narrative that reflected the cynical anti-corporate feel of many 70's movies. The result was an iconic and brilliantly presented sci-fi horror movie.Directed by Ridley Scott from a script from Dan O'Bannon, Alien is very intelligently made. None of the cast were stars at the time. This factored into the generation of suspense, as we simply have no idea who will emerge as the hero and who will die - if Charlton Heston was in Alien, for example, you'd have a pretty good idea from the get-go - this casting decision is one that very few subsequent big budget movies have made; to their detriment and to Alien's success. As it was, Sigourney Weaver was the strongest and most capable figure. Apart from a blink-and-you-will-miss-it cameo in Woody Allen's Annie Hall, she hadn't really been in anything before this. Ripley was her calling and she created one of the definitive strong female characters of all time. There are of course other excellent performances from, among others, Ian Holm as the android and John Hurt in the unforgettable role as the first victim.But as much as anything else, Alien is a triumph of brilliant design work. The looks of the Nostromo and the alien ships are entirely different. Both teams created them in isolation from one another in order to create pure designs 'alien' from one and other. The Nostromo is pleasingly rough, with coffee mugs left lying around etc, it really looks like the kind of place that people live and work. The alien ship and the alien itself are of course the work of surreal artist H. R. Giger. To say that his work is effective would be a gross understatement; the alien itself is a terrifically threatening creation. It's a giant phallic killing machine with jaws within jaws. And this is to say nothing of the eggs, the face-hugger and the chest-buster. Really this is a movie with more creativity than a hundred others.","

"Alien","starry-2","18 October 2019","Warning: Spoilers.Finally cinema's premier ambient genius atmospheric and primal fear sci-fi & horror masterpiece (directed brilliantly by Ridley Scott) gets the 4k treatment for home viewing. This film, the arty sci-fi version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, starts with a brooding isolation in space mood then builds nicely when the 'truckers in space' land on a derelict planet to find the source of an alien transmission which may be a warning according to a female crew member. What happens then is that a bizarre alien species with an interesting life cycle then begins to be the hunter and one by one gets each crew member. The film is a first for showing a very visceral graphic violent scene which scared off audience members while making the others sick. The acting is superb. Ian Holm as Ash, is acted amazingly. It's funny in a smart way how much human traits he has in his personality- his deceptive ways, the high-strung and annoyed aspects are so intense and highly reactive that its almost funny in a good way. John Hurt's character is devoted, enthusiastic and meek in comparison. His curiosity gets the best of him however. It's also interesting to note that after 35 years of watching this film that I now see that captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt), also annoyed and high strung is actually going along with Ash and his constant bickering reminders that the alien must go back to earth for study despite the company's secret 'Special Orders' in that the alien is of highest priority and that the crew is expendable. The rest of the acting by Yaphet Kotto (cocky alpha brave male), Harry Dean Stanton, his right hand man and parrot (""RIIIIIIGGGGHHT..."" is amusing), Veronica Cartwright (frail and adds fear and tension at her improvised crying helpless scenes (something she does rather well- see her performance as a child in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds) and Sigourney Weaver as the proper ethical company person who takes the cake and balls in the film and innovates to dispose of the beast. The Alien and the planet's topography and Alien derelict ship was designed by Swiss surrealist painter and sculptor H.R. Ginger. No expense was spared- here he created sexually suggestive and ultra creepy aspects to the creature (a mix of organic and mechanical dna) and landscape. The tension builds up so amazingly that you'll find yourself downright baking in fear whilst rooting for the heroine to be to kill the alien or successfully escape. The music by Jerry gold Smith's a winner here...bizarre yet fitting classical ambient with a weird cool depressing down tone compliments the action while translating the story into more atmosphere and fear, rather artistically. This film was a huge success and its trajectory is unforgettable and relentless. This became an ultra huge comercial cult hit and is the best of the franchise it brewed. The vast nature of space, 7 crew members, one ship and one hell of a unique, hostile and clever alien that has Kill on its mind. He director has the audience gripping their seats throughout that the surprise stick he throws at us, the viewers, into the drama's spokes is more than a acceptable and furthers the constant building of relentlessness. It's perfect right down to the end credits' music, which plays out ironically like funeral music and great ending mellow classical fanfare. ALIEN is one of the best films in the past 40 years. It never ages and of course never let's go.The 4k blu ray's image is a 4 out of 5, as it was transferred around 2013/4 using earlier equipment. I suspect the original 35mm film negative was not used as the film looks like a bit of a well worn faded documentary film. However that's to the analytical eye....the lighting is meant to look that way. The sound is superb, and you can listen to every mix they ever made for it it...from dolby pro logic matrixed mixes to early ac-3 (5.1 surround) for laser discs to a new 7.1 mix. Included are audio commentaries and the cash grab 2003 extended cut. Alien is a masterpiece of psychology , fight for survival while living a nightmare that keeps getting worse.","

As a huge sci-fi fan I assumed this would be some kind of low budget monster movie that would be mildly diverting. I'd never heard of Ridley Scott before... I came out of the cinema stunned and wanted to see this again immediately. To say it is one of the greatest sci- fi films of all time is under-rating it. It is one of the greatest films of all time.Performances that are pitch-perfect from a stellar cast. The first dirty, grungie space vessel that I'd seen in a film - more gritty and real than anything that had ever been offered up before. A freighter - not a fighter or a star-destroyer or something glamorous. Just a working freighter.And a villain that was relentless, a perfect killing machine. Tougher than anything - with acid for blood! And in the end a heroine that was just as relentless. Ripley. Legendary now, revolutionary then.

"Alien","ThomasDrufke","16 May 2017","When you talk about the greatest science fiction films ever made, you have to at least include the original Alien in the conversation. It spawned an entire franchise, sure, but it also inspired an entire generation of filmmakers that still resonates throughout filmmaking today. It's often imitated, but never duplicated.I love going back and re-watching this film because it's one of the few horror films I can remember that isn't tarnished upon second viewing. It's always hard to make a film that is just as good the second time around, but it's particularly challenging with horror films. There's something about knowing when each scare is coming and knowing who gets killed off first that usually ruins the fun. However, 1979's Alien is quite the achievement in transcending the ""trapped in a confined space"" genre.The one thing that always shines through with Alien is Ridley Scott's vision. He's one of those directors that when he's on top of his game, there's no one better at displaying a singular vision for filmmaking. He was certainly inspired by a few sci-fi's that came before like 2001 or maybe even Forbidden Planet, but Alien is its own entity. And boy does it possess one particular entity that scared an entire generation.Much like the entire film around it, the Xenomorph is a fascinating piece of art. I love H.R. Giger's design. I love its origin. I love that its hidden for half the film. I love that there's actually a human underneath all that terrifying skin. Heck, I love that this thing has two mouths, both just as horrifying as the other. The Xenomorph is as much the star of this film as Sigourney Weaver is, and they both complement each other brilliantly, as strange as that sounds.But let's talk about Weaver & the crew. If there's ever a memorable crew in one of these space mission films, it's in Alien. And the crazy thing is, you don't necessarily get to know any of them in depth to care about their health and well-being. Most of the film is spent in silence, which makes it all the more powerful when the Alien does attack. Sometime less is more, huh? In its entirety, Alien is one of the greatest films ever made, and easily one of the most memorable. Whether it's the dinner scene, the cat, Weaver kicking a** in her underwear, the reveal with Ash, or just the endless amount of beautiful establishing shots and production design, Alien is a masterpiece.+Tension+Scott's vision+The production design & effects+Birth of the Xenomorph10/10","

The characters are so well portrayed that you don't even know who is the main character untill 50 minutes in. The reallism of this movie is still unmatched. Ridley Scott did one of the best movie direction ever, by not answering all question and leaving you wondering. Some of the scenes don't make sense in the first place but when you think back, you finaly understand the answer. The dialog is nothing special but the way its told is impresive.

Since this movie is involved in the sci-fi genre, I decided to check this film out. I am glad I did.The plot is simple. It's about seven crew members aboard a spaceship returning large amounts of mineral ore to Earth. Along the way, they intercept an apparent SOS transmission. But little did the crew know that the transmission is not an SOS, but an warning. One that will end in devastation.The acting is great and believable led by Director Ridley Scott and unknown actress Signourey Weaver. Scott is one of the best directors of all time. Weaver did a great job with Ripley. I also give kudos to John Hurt and Ian Holm, more great actors.The special effects are excellent. Especially for a movie released in 1979. In fact, It won best an Oscar for visual effects.My favorite scene is the when the alien popped out of the chest of one guy. That was scary.

"Alien","Corky1984","14 June 2005","Alien is one of Ridley Scott's masterpieces. What is so impressive about the film is that the pacing feels exactly right. There is an ideal blend of character development, suspense and then action. For 1979, the special effects are surprisingly good and many years later the film still looks great. The Alien is of course one of cinema's greatest creations, the shape of the creature being unlike any other and holding a wonderful distinctiveness. The storyline is simple, but effective. Corporate greed forces the mining crew to investigate a planet on their way back to earth. Inhabited by scores of strange slimy eggs, one of the crew, John Hurt, is attacked by a reptilian like 'hand with a tail' for want of a better phrase. Stuck to his face it is planting an alien inside him, an alien that spectacularly erupts from him whilst eating dinner! There then follows the rest of the film in which the remaining crew members hunt for the escaped beast, unaware initially that it is growing ever larger and deadlier. One by one the crew are picked off in a series of well executed scenes that are at times subtle and then violent. Sigourney Weaver eventually emerges as the star of the film, the last one left on-board the space ship. Along the way she uncovers the chicanery of Ian Holm's Ash character, who is in fact an android working for the company and operating a myriad of Machiavellian policies. In one of the highlights of the film, she battles with the out of control Ash in a frantic attempt to learn the truth and save her life. The film ends in typically dramatic style and leaves you feeling more than entertained. The next three films in the series were all good efforts, but perhaps this one is the best? Regardless of its ranking, it merits a place in any film fan's collection.","

"Alien","taldarus","22 December 2020","There are two monster movies that have stood the test of time, and actually prospered. Alien and Predator.Both have one thing in common. A nearly perfect presentation of two separate stories. Like Predator, there is nothing genuinely original in either of the two stories.
Separately they are a sub-par story, but they are put together in near perfection for this movie. Everything in this movie is well done, and has aged extremely well.It does show its age, but in ways that don't conflict with the story setting. The old junker computers weren't made to look 'advanced' but primitive, durable 'working machines'. Things like this.The performance of the crew is superb, and really feels natural and comfortable through movie.Note: This movie is wonderful, and extremely watchable; but it can get extremely graphic. So I wouldn't actually recommend it to people who don't like gore.","

"Alien","SoumikBanerjee1996","10 July 2020","Coming from Ridley Scott, The Cult Classic ""Alien"" that truly shaped Sci-fi genre afterwards; is a remarkably well made film. That inspired so many filmmakers to indulge themselves in these kind of fascinating tales. Considering the era it belongs to; that alone makes it much more impressive but at the same time it still has some pertaining isssues which I really want to discuss.Set in the dystopian future, where space travels have now become a norm and astronauts are instructed to explore newer life and organisms beyond our solar system constantly.
The plot revolves around one of those ships, named ""Nostromo"" containing 7 people who have just woken up from their sleep capsules after their mothership received a distress signal from a nearby planet. The story continues from thereon.Released back in the 1979, the art direction, cinematography, the VFX; everything looked pretty amazing. Even by today's standards they seemed almost competitive. Although it has some isssues regarding the usage of underwhelming Prosthetics, Make Ups but I can understand the limitations they had in those time and age.I would not have complained at all, had I seen this earlier; maybe 10-15 years back. But unfortunately after so many years of experiencing better Sci-Fi productions, at the age of 23; only now I have decided to see this classic for the first time. Too late in the party I guess!Therefore I couldn't unsee the shortcomings on Make Ups, And Props that are being used because of how Hollywood itself as a industry has evolved in terms of Artistic approaches; I couldn't simply nod my head for nostalgia sake and say those were perfect. Sorry I Just Can't!Another issue I have with the characters themselves. Apart from Ripley played by Sigourney Weaver, others seemed weaker in terms of build ups and their individual personalities. I couldn't even care for any one of them. I loved Ripley as the strong lead who single handedly carried it on her shoulders. Without her inclusion this would have been a unpleasant viewing!As for the sound design and background music goes; that was awesome. The makers used a subtle layering of Music whenever situation is demanding. Other times pure silence did the work. Full marks for the audio department.Screenplay and the Editing looked sharp most of the times. On few occasions I found out the cuts or the transitions to be unclear and interrupted in midway. I watched the director's cut, haven't seen the Theatrical one yet so that might be the case but I did notice some glaring issues regarding various frame transitions throughout the runtime. I might be too nitpicky here, but for a cult classic that is both critically acclaimed and loved by the fans; I think I can.Now don't get me wrong, my criticism is my own personal viewpoint. And I know I'm in the minority here but as a reviewer I needed to express an honest opinion. And I just did that with clear enough explanations.That doesn't mean I didn't like the film, Definitely I did. I really liked the film. The scares, the tension, the suspense alongside an amazing camera work, art direction and sound design it certainly grabbed my attention. But still it couldn't make a lasting impression on me. I wanted to love this, as a Sci Fi Enthusiastic; I wished it to be among the best. But to my overwhelming expectations; It missed the spot.","

"Alien","Artimidor","3 January 2012","Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" has easily advanced to the definitive modern day horror classic by hiding the horror rather than showing it, thus appealing primarily to the viewer's imagination and omitting in-the-face special effects. The man in a costume, cheesy must-have in all kinds of sci-fi and horror flicks of the fifties and sixties, still serves his purpose in this film, which however has the advantage of being masterfully directed. ""Alien"" is a perfectly slow paced composition of shadows, noises, musical cues, a film of claustrophobic, tense atmosphere oozing dread and despair, all this creating suspense in the most accomplished Hitchcockian sense: The film provides a scenario where the unknown danger is as unpredictable as it is certain that it does strike.Aside from its directorial brilliance, ""Alien"" of course also has one of the most innovative monster designs in movie history to offer (H.R. Giger's incredibly beautiful otherworldly creature), another excellent Jerry Goldsmith score, exceptionally strong characters and an outstanding female lead in Sigourney Weaver - and last but not least there's that perfect script, which makes a relatively simple idea into an unforgettable story. Put in three words: First rate horror.","

"Alien","samwellcross","1 September 2015","Simply put this is horror perfection. The detail in the film is down to a tee. From the score all the way down to the acting. The set was deliberately made to be as claustrophobic as possible by Scott and it plays a vital role in the whole tone of the finished film. The acting is perfect in terms of the necessary tension needed for the film and the cast is star studded for the day (albeit Sigourney Weaver was a relative unknown at the time). The beast itself is the ultimate in horror terror and nothing will ever be scarier on screen, especially seeing as though it's all computer generated nowadays, and the fact that you don't see a lot of the beast adds to the tension and fear. The pacing is a bit slow to start with but rips into the action when the face hugger makes it's debut appearance. The tagline is 100% the best tagline in the history of film, and goes extremely well with the setting of space. It's got to be said that horror doesn't get any better than this. Absolute perfection. 10/10.","

"Alien","Prismark10","14 October 2023","In space, no one can hear you scream was the tagline for Alien. Although not original, it became a seminal modern sci fi horror/thriller. It also gave director Ridley Scott a welcome calling card.At the very least in having a female action hero in Sigourney Weaver who plays Ripley.The crew of the industrial spaceship Nostromo are sent to investigate a crashed spacecraft in an uninhabited planet. One of the crewman Kane (John Hurt) gets too near a mysterious egg that discharges a facehugger.Kane is brought back to the ship against the advice of Ripley. Partly die to the actions of the sinister science officer Ash (Ian Holm) who has an hidden agenda.The facehugger dies, Kane recovers but he later gets stomach cramps.Scott has made a tight claustrophobic dark haunted spaceship thriller with added jump scares and some gore. The crew members are picked off one by one by the rapidly evolving alien creature or as Ash views it, a perfect killing machine.Although the heroine of the film was not originally intended to be a female. Weaver steps up to the challenge in going one on one with the creature.What really adds a dimension is the alien creature, influenced by the designs of HR Giger.","

"Alien","Onethought","20 January 2006","I give it a 10/10 without doubt. I am not giving it a 10/10 out of compassion but because of the creative and cinematographic (relative)perfection. Please mind that even though it has a new directors cut re-release, this movie is actually a full 25 years old!!! Even when you watch it now it stands it own and that is the magnificence of the art-director and of Ridley Scott, the film director.Ah then you get to see one of the best (or simply the best) female action heroes ever created on screen. Sigourney Weaver is just so memorable. Please don't forget that the brilliance of this movie launched a whole quadrology. That itself is a testament to this first one: Alien. The second one Aliens directed by James Cameroon is an epic in itself but much of the foundation was (perhaps inadvertently) laid by Ridley Scott in this movie. Please note another side effect was that female heroes were used by Hollywood after this movie in very big productions.Each shot, each scene and sequences build up the film in a fantastic manner that is old school but still so difficult to achieve. It is like Da Vinchi's painting. It is old school style. But still difficult to do. Story is about the crew of a mining ship who end up with an alien while answering an SOS call. Alien: not as in an illegal immigrant (er.. this is not a political movie about borders and immigration...) Alien as in the most scary creature ever devised. Truly alien. In every way it is so brilliant. I had a great experience when I watched it again. Definitely one of the all time greatest movies.","

"Alien","insomniac_rod","20 September 2009","The result was beautiful, it's the ultimate monster-piece of Sci-Fi and Horror. To date, no other movie has achieved what ""Alien"" did.When I think of sci-fi oriented plots the words that immediately come to my mind are complicated, interesting, intelligent, fantasy. ""Alien"" mixes those elements with the Horror genre and it provokes a revolution in cinema overall.The plot is breath taking since the beginning of the movie and it's supported with spectacular f/x, creepy explanations, technical oriented dialogs, and even settings.Horror happens and is exploited here when the Alien grows up and decides to annihilate the tripulation. We get chilling chasing sequences, creepy environments that breathe death and uncertainty, a scary monster, and nightmarish sounds.The action is non-stop and it's equilibrated with clever dialogs and interesting explanations towards the system of the ship, and a new form of life.This is a groundbreaking film that changed cinema in a positive manner. It demonstrates that Hollywood can be dark, violent, unsettling, in terms of quality. Money well spent here.The legend of ""Alien"" started here and created a new form of fear... in space. Plus it's tag line is amongst the best of history.","

"Alien","alexx668","17 June 2008","Despite it's legendary status, the truth is that Alien is just a horror movie set out in space, i.e. the alien monster taking the part of the serial killer that's murdering the cast one by one (minus of course the main character, in this case Ripley - played by Sigourney Weaver). So, nothing original, apart from that it's set in outer space.Then where does that leave us? Well, two things are really of note. H.R. Giger's design of the alien planet and the creature itself - chilling and nightmarish, in what is the brush of a true artist, and also Ash's poetic reflection on the alien monster: ""Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility."" ""I admire its purity. A survivor.. unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.""And yet despite the atmospheric approach, it's unclear what angle or view, if any, the film offers. Seemingly it condemns the instinctive effort for survival of the alien creature, yet in the end it's the morally bound humankind which prevails. In fact, the scene in the end where Ripley comes face to face with the alien and kills it by shooting it in outer space is probably the film's center of gravity. The alien creature is for the first time looking insecure and scared of dying, but Ripley (guided by her own instincts) shows no remorse. Here, the roles of the hunter and the hunted are blurred, and so is the moral status of mankind.Other minor themes are the remorseless capitalist stance of the mother/company, which also hides a metaphysical meaning (the company is called mother, it controls the destiny of the crew, has it's own purposes, has it's chosen representative amongst the crew with the robot Ash etc).","

"Alien","TheDragonTrader","25 April 2019","In a seemingly abandoned spaceship, the silence is interrupted by an incoming signal. An automatic program wakes the crew up from hibernation. Disoriented, they assume they're close to home: earth. But no, they're still only halfway there. The signal that was picked up by the ship comes from an unknown origin on an unknown planet and they, the unprepared crew of a simple cargo ship, must go out to investigate. And nothing can prepare them for what they will encounter...This slow burn horror masterpiece gives you the chills, even today, and will keep doing it for years to come. It works because of the practical effects, because of the brilliant directing because of the acting, because of the music, because of the set pieces... should I continue?The futuristic universe 'Alien' takes place in is put before us and is compellingly realistic. With several winks at Kubric's '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) in the design of the ship and the momentary hint of classical music, it creates a sense of familiarity, yet in the ships' largely industrial-gothic appearance it puts us on guard as well. Their technology is being explained, but only when the characters absolutely need to mention it. The rest stays unsaid, but is made clear by other aspects of the movie than dialogue.If that alone is not enough to prove that Ridley Scott is a cinematic genius, we'll talk a bit more about him. He delivered his vision of a movie that's 'Jaws in space' the way he wanted it and the way we needed it. Scott makes movies the way no one has ever seen one: visually renewing, with a whole new believable world to tell a story in (also take a look at 'Blade Runner' (1982), 'Gladiator' (2000), 'The Martian' (2017) ...). This one in particular is one of my favourites in terms of style.Take the design of the hostile Alien creature (the Xenomorph). When shown the work of Swiss artist H. G. Giger by screenwriter O'Bannon, he saw the potential it possessed and had Giger design the creature. The result is as terrifying as it is artful. Appearing as vaguely human, but out of this world in all its aspects.The characters in the first drafts of the script were unisex and could be filled in by both men and women. The studio bosses, all white old males at the time, off course demanded the leading role to be an man. But, Scott said no. In his vision, the main character was a woman, simple as that. And let's be honest, without Sigourney Weaver, this movie would never have been as good as it is. She (the whole cast to be honest, but especially her) had me gasping for breath again and again. Her panic and determination are compelling.All this, and the way he ingeniously builds scenes where the tension gets unbearable and the way he added and cut scenes in order to tell the full story without interrupting the flow of the film, prove that he is one heck of a film maker.This is also a feminist movie, although many will argue that it was never intended to be. But the result is a feminist movie nonetheless. Not only is the main character a woman, outstandingly brought to life by Sigourney Weaver, the underlying themes of the movie are feminist as well. Because actually, this is a movie about rape. And here, it's not only the women that can fear unwanted penetration, but also the men. This rape-theme, executed by the so-called 'Face-Huggers', is unsettling for all viewers. Also notice the phallus-like design of the Alien creatures.The tension is guided by the subtle score of Jerry Goldsmith. The panting flutes, the wailing violins, the assaulting brass section and the beautiful main theme. It is a composition that is unmatched in the horror genre. And where modern scores for scary movies, mean nothing more than a scary addition to the film, this modernist score truly tells a story on its own.'Alien' is, all snobbish intellectual analyses put aside, in the first place one of the best horror films ever made. It gives everyone the creeps, it lingers and it's pure art. And come on: there is a cat! How can you not like this movie? But what makes it truly great, is the fact that when you look a bit closer, there's more to it than meets the eye at first.And remember, if you ever get to journey through our solar system or beyond...
In space, no one can hear you scream.","

"Alien","craig-hopton","16 September 2014","This is a fantastic Sci-Fi horror. It ticks every box. The dark, Gothic horror and suspense builds wonderfully. The alien is genuinely frightening and biologically convincing, when it could easily have looked absurd. The plot is simple, perfectly so. The cast are great - particularly Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm.The real mark of genius, though, is the way the characters get picked off one - by one - by one. It keeps you guessing, and right to the death it's not obvious who will be the last survivor, or even if there will be a last survivor. Downsides? The special effects are, unsurprisingly, ageing. Mostly this is covered up by the fact that we're deliberately only given brief glimpses of the alien. But occasionally the facade slips. For example, there's a scene right at the end where the alien is on the outside of a space-craft and looks like it's being carried around on a piece of string.But special effects will always age and that can be forgiven. It doesn't detract from a movie that fully achieves what it sets out do - keep you enthralled and on the edge of your seat the whole way through.","

"Alien","kclipper","22 July 2011","'Alien' is a prime example of what happens when many talented people from different walks of life combine ideas and collaborate on a simple, but innovative masterpiece. Its a technological, groundbreaking success on just about every level, playing on the audience's fear of the unknown and what could be waiting in the dark to get us, and it's use of the subconscious element of sexual-resemblance gets under our skin and probes the perverse corners of our imaginations.Writer Dan O'Bannon concocted the screenplay shortly after being introduced to the genius of Swiss artist/sculptor, H.R. Giger (His horrific visions appear to him in nightmares.), who provided the details, not only for the excellent creature design, but the harsh landscapes, strange spacecrafts, and surreal interior sets. Along comes director, Ridley Scott, whose eye for eeriness and sheer ambiance proves worthy in every frame, and not to mention the tremendously effective score by John Williams supplying even more tension and mood. An experienced cast headed by newcomer at the time, Sigourney Weaver, who ultimately becomes an iconic female fighting force during an unforgettable climatic showdown with the creature is wonderful, and so is Ian Holm as 'Ash', the android who goes haywire. The most memorable scene (and the one that convinced the studios to invest) is the ""chestbursting"" scene, which shocks the viewer, providing the realization that from there on, this is a horror film. This has top-notch special effects that look so convincingly real that it revolutionized the way films are made. I refer to this as the ""original"" terror in outer space, Although gathering many of its ideas from classic films such as 'It, Terror From Beyond Space', this breakthrough in science fiction/horror was followed by more rip-offs and genre clones than any other film in history. Its a breathtaking and historic achievement that will be remembered for all cinematic eternity, and it launched a series of various sequels, making it the landmark introduction to one of the best sagas in the science fiction world. The 2003 Director's Cut Edition is the way to go, featuring the infamous Tom Skerritt cocoon scene.","

"Alien","danielfarmer-80144","5 September 2021","An absolute masterpiece of a film. This is how you make a horror film. The plot is fairly straight forward but its the cast and characters that make this movie. Superb acting from the likes of Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm and John Hurt make you really invested in the characters. What i liked about Alien is that you do not really know who is supposed to be the main character until about halfway through the movie which makes it feel much more realistic and believable. There is also some unexpected twists in the plot which are really shocking.The Alien design in this movie is the most awesome thing ever. Its so unique and terrifying. It is in my opinion the most interesting 'antagonist' so to speak created in a horror film to date. So must more interesting than a man in a mask just stabbing people. The practical effects are astonishing and its mind blowing how realistic they made this look in 1979. It still holds up perfectly today. This is one of the most well directed films i have ever seen. Every shot is perfect and carries meaning. The setting and locations are absolutely beautiful and the pacing is perfect. If you're an aspiring filmmaker and you want to learn them this is a must see.Alien absolutely masters the art of suspense and creating an unnerving atmosphere. Everything in this movie from the alien and Alien ship design by HR Geiger, the beautiful sets and cinematography and the incredible sound track by Jerry Goldsmith creates an atmosphere like no other film. The audio is also very well balanced. The film knows when to use music and when to be silent, it just uses them at the perfect times and it all helps to make one of the most suspenseful movies i've ever seen.This movie is one of the most perfect and beautiful films ever made, is my 3rd favourite movie of all time and in my opinion the pinnacle of Sci Fi and Horror. 10/10.","

"Alien","blazesnakes9","15 August 2011","There are unsolved mysteries in our space. There are surprises sometime around the corner. And even if it should be left alone, you should know that by now. Alien, which is directed by Ridely Scott delivers a heart-pounding suspenseful movie. The movie is taking place in the deep outer space where the cargo ship, the Nostromo is on its way home. There are seven people in the Nostromo. They soon pick up a signal from distant planet.Rather than make their way back to Earth, the Nostromo crew, which is played by a well known cast including Sigourney Weaver as the control officer on the ship. After leaving the planet, one of the member is attacked by a mutant that basically latches onto your face and stay there. But, what they don't know is that the movie's villain is on the ship. Alien has a great deal in special effects and its set direction is the one I like the most. There are also great shots of scenes involving claustrophobia. But, one of the most famous scenes in the movie is when the member who recovers from being attack by the facehugger and then, he finds out that a chestburster or a parasite is inside of him. This scene is very gory and is not for the faint-hearted. Alien is a great movie because it is like Jaws, or in other words, have a great deal in suspense. The background score is really frightening for those scenes where the Alien pops out. An terrific science fiction thriller. ★★★★ 4 stars.","

We join the space-freighter, Nostrodomo, as it explores a planet for the most mundane of all reasons; to make a profit from new materials. Be careful what you wish for. The crew finds plenty of new materials, but also finds one of the most frightening film monsters of all time as well. The cast is excellent. Led by Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerrit, John Hurt, Yaphet Kotto, and Harry Dean Stanton, we get top-of-the-line performances.A lot of this film is psychological; and the atmosphere just adds to the psychological discomfort one feels through the entire film.

"Alien","vipcorp-954-708527","1 April 2014","Not much to say that hasn't been said about Alien. I am doing my small part to pump the rating up to a solid 9 where it belongs.I saw this on the big screen during it's opening week when I was 11 in a REAL theater - huge (holding 1075 people), packed house, spring-rocking seats, 70mm film, six track Dolby...wondrous. I have watched Alien at least 50 times since and I will never grow tired of it.The overall mood of the film is chilling and suspenseful. The detail and sheer beauty of the Nostromo's interior is stunning. I could easily watch an entire hour of slow, sweeping pans of the rooms and corridors alone. Nothing before or since has ever come close.The special effects in Alien are fantastic by any standard. Yes, there is one scene in which someone attempts to stand something upright on a table and another where something appears to be moving on a dolly that reveal some limitations, but these are more than acceptable trade-offs for the realism of makeup versus CGI. I am sure the editors wished they had a few more takes to work with, but they did their best with the shots they had and these very minor flaws do not detract.I would have thought that by now, CGI would be a match for ""old-fashioned"" silicone and makeup, but sadly no. CGI still looks fake and has never produced a single, believable, creature or superhero in all these years. Ever. I find that very sad. I don't know if it is because the technology for realism just isn't here yet or if it is simply a lack of human talent in adding in the ""imperfections"" that make things look real. I suspect it's a combination of both plus a lack of budget for the time it would take and I don't think we will see real-looking CGI for at least another 30 years. I wish more films today would shun CGI altogether. Models, silicone and makeup are far superior. Come on CGI effects teams - CATCH UP! Well, that's my rant on CGI... But although the sets and effects are wonderful, Alien is not a special effects film. It is pure suspense and horror in a sci-fi setting, done to perfection.Alright that's enough. If you are the one person alive who hasn't seen this, what are you waiting for? If sci-fi or slow suspense is not your cup of tea, so be it. It takes all kinds to make a world, but give it a shot - give it its due. Alien is truly an amazing work of art.","

"Alien","fjk1138-731-161881","20 December 2017","While most people love Aliens, the sequel to this film, for my money nothing beats the first Alien movie. Considering when this came out in the late 70s, the only other ""kid on the block"" was the original Star Wars movie from 1977. While that Star Wars will always be my favorite movie of all time, Alien took sci-fi and horror to a whole new level.There is nothing but artistry in this movie: the sets are amazing and extremely realistic, the sound and music are pulse-pounding and intense, the effects are almost all practical (all of them are pre-CG). The actors all do a superb job and there are a couple of surprises that happen in terms of who does what and where loyalties truly lie.Then there is the Alien, a product of master artist HR Giger's nightmares. Ridley Scott chose to show LESS of the Alien rather than more of it, which makes you wonder where it is at all times. Is that shadow over there where it's hiding? Is it crouching amongst the pipes? Will it jump out an attack at any point? All of this tension is created by showing as little of the creature as possible.Also, this is not a fast bang up action movie. This is a slowly paced film that works to build tension and horror in a masterful way. There is no shaky cam or other poorly shot footage, everything is meticulously done.In case you are reading this and have not seen the movie, I will not spoil it for you.

"Alien","martinpersson97","19 November 2021","This iconic movie by Ridley Scott is truly a masterpiece by every sense of the meaning.Combining a futuristic scifi/space narrative with a haunted house-style genre, it manages to work on both angles seamlessly.The effects are groundbreaking, the creature (later titled Xenomorph) especially, and it's both astonishing and horryfing to look at.The actors all do a great job, and the back-and forth banter between the characters really adds to it all, Signourney Weaver in particular establishes herself as an iconic female hero.It's not as heavy on action and adventure as its sequel, but rather a slow paced and suspensful horror thriller that stands perfectly on its own! Luckily, the sequel is even better, but on to that one later!","

"Alien","Jaymz13","8 May 2021","Part of the secret of this film is that you never get a good look at the alien. All you see is hints and glimpses. While this may seem to have been done to cover for poor creature effects, the reality is that it adds to the tension. Alien is an exercise in quiet tension and measured intensity from start to finish. This effect would have dissolved if we had seen the xenomorph in full.","

"Alien","Reviews_of_the_Dead","12 October 2021","This film is one that I'm not entirely sure when I saw it all the way through for the first time. I regularly watched its sequel, Aliens. I'm thinking it was in college. Since then though, I've seen this one more than any other in the series. I've seen this at least once in the theater as well and now on 4K with Jaime as it is on the poster of movies we are working through. The synopsis is after a space merchant vessel receives an unknown transmission as a distress call, one of the crew is attacked by a mysterious life form and they soon realize that its life cycle has merely begun.For this, we begin by getting background information of the story. We are following a spaceship, the Nostromo, which is coming back from a mining mission. They are approaching a planet where a beacon is going off. The crew are awoken early and told by their company to check it out. They are not sure if it is an S. O. S. Or not thoughThe captain is Dallas (Tom Skerritt) and his second in command being Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). They try to land on the desolate planet, but their hull is punctured by jagged rocks in the process. Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) and Parker (Yaphet Kotto) go about trying to fix the damage while Dallas leads a team of Kane (John Hurt) and Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) to check out what is sending the beacon. Ripley monitosr from the ship along with the help of their chief science officer, Ash (Ian Holm)The planet is desolate and hard to see. They move deeper into the spaceship where they discover a large dead alien. Its chest has been ripped open from the inside. They can tell as the ribs are broken outward. Kane goes deeper to find eggs and an odd fog around them. There is movement inside one. Something emerges and attacks him.Dallas and Lambert bring him back to the ship and demand to be let in. They need to get Kane to the infirmary before whatever has attached to his face kills him. Ripley reminds them of their protocol about decontamination and that they need to quarantine to ensure it doesn't infect the rest of the crew. She is under-minded by Ash though and they're admitted back on to the ship.Dallas and Ash remove Kane's spacesuit and assess what has attached to him. They cannot remove it, because if they try it tightens its grip around his neck. The thing has blood that is acid and it feeds nutrients to Kane, keeping him alive in a coma. They try to figure out something to do to save him, but before they can the thing dies and he wakes, starving.At the meal, everything seems back to normal and everyone is having fun until we learn what happened to the alien that was flying the spaceship. Kane meets the same demise as an alien escapes from inside him through his chest. It is small at first, but as the synopsis states, this is just the beginning.That is where I'm going to leave my recap and I'm also going to assume that most everyone has seen this movie before. It is definitely an interesting idea. What makes it so great is the world that Ridley Scott, the director, along with Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett come up with. What I mean here is that we have these blue collar workers in space. It almost feels like Dallas is a truck driver with Brett and Parker being mechanics. It feels quite grounded despite being in the future. The characters feel natural to people you would know they are just in space.Then from that set up, we have the horror elements. I've heard many different theories on this movie from it not being horror, to be a haunted house or a slasher film in space. I can definitely see the last two for sure. Once this Xenomorph, as they will be called in later films, gets on board, the tension is constantly raising until it ends. People are being picked off here. We don't even necessarily need to see things happening, but we do with some quick cuts. It allows our brain to fill in. It is stated in this movie that we have the perfect killing machine which is terrifying.What I've picked up on this time seeing the movie is that there is an interesting social commentary here. There is a company that these people are working for. I don't recall if their name is stated here, but it is a major corporation regardless. There is a computer by the name of Mother (Helen Horton) that they communicate with. I love there is a secret directive here that only Ash is privy to. Throughout the movie there are little hints that he might not be able to be trusted and it all comes together as the tensions rise.That should be enough for the story so I'll go to something that is quite strong here which is the acting. Skerritt is great as our captain here. I like that we feel for a good portion of the movie he could be our hero. He's faced with some tough decisions for sure. The true star of this is Weaver. It is hard to technically put her in the 'final girl' category, but I love how strong of a heroine she is. We just have a strong cast across the board after that. Cartwright, Stanton, Hurt, Holm and Kotto are all great. I will give credit to Bolaji Badejo and Eddie Powell who are the alien in the movie. They both do great as well.From here let me go to the effects, cinematography and the soundtrack. For the former, they're on point. The cinematography helps here as well. We have this suit that looks quite real and it is amazing for being 1979. The actors inside definitely help as well. What is also impressive though is how real the spaceships look. They have a lived in feel along with grittiness to them. It doesn't feel like you'd get with other space movies where things are white and clean. This feels like a spaceship being held together with band-aids and grease. I think the cinematography definitely aids here, especially with making this feel like the future, while also feeling grounded. The soundtrack also helps to build the atmosphere as well.So then in conclusion here, this is a classic. I might not have grown up with this movie, but I can see why it has withstood the test of time. We have a futuristic movie that feels grounded. This can be seen as a haunted house or a slasher film that is set in space with an alien. The acting is great across the board. The effects are on point for me which are helped by the cinematography. The soundtrack also helps to set the atmosphere that is needed here. This is as close as you can get a perfect film for me. If you've never seen this, I could recommend giving it a viewing for sure.","

"Alien","davidmvining","26 November 2019","The title to this movie is so utterly perfect, much like the rest of the film. In terms of straight entertainment, I find Alien to be a pinnacle of tension building terror in film. It's one of the most thoroughly entertaining horror movies ever made. I love Ridley Scott, I call myself a Ridley Scott fanboi, but he hasn't matched Alien in his career since though he's come pretty close.The Nostromo, a hauling vessel, is pulling tens of millions of tons of ore across the galaxy. It's crew is in suspended animation for the duration of the trip, but their onboard computer, Muthur, wakes them up early when she receives a signal of unknown original coming from a nearby planet. The crew goes down to the surface, investigates, gets an alien organism attached to one of their faces, and come back on board. Famous images happen after the creature on the face lets go and dies and another alien creature bursts forth from the crewmember's chest. The alien grows, killing the crew one by one, until there's only one who escapes.Okay...plot summary done. There's so much that makes this movie work as well as it does, but I think the best place to start is that title. ""Alien"" implies something from the outside coming in. An alien, in terms of earthly immigration, isn't an alien if they stay in their own country. They become an alien by entering another country. ""Alien"" also implies something strange and different from normal experiences. The alienness of Alien isn't just the fact that we have an extraterrestrial, but that it's coming from the outside and coming in, uninvited, I might add.The crew feels like a group of siblings. There's no hint of romance between anyone, and they all bicker like brothers and sisters with Dallas (the captain) acting like the eldest brother. Their mother (Muthur) guides them and directs them. It is into this family unit that the outside entity, the xenomorph, gets introduced, but to take the motif and theme further, it manifests in a literal invasion of the crewmember's (Kane's) body. The terror, much like that in The Shining, comes from an external force invading something that should be held free of invasion, a form of a family.There are a couple of additions to that external pressure to the family unit. Ash, the science officer, we learn later, was added to the crew only two days before their departure from earth. Ash is obviously not really part of the team. He's always just a bit apart and he acts less comfortably in the group than the rest. He's actually an android and he malfunctions in pursuit of his secret mission. Muthur herself is influenced by outside forces, turning her against the crew. She and Ash share the same secret mission, to retrieve the alien at all costs, leaving the crew as expendable. That outside influence perverts the warm cocoon of Muther's room (all soft white lights in the middle of the dark metal grays of the rest of the ship) into something sinister.The idea of invasion is so complete in the film's packaging of terror and fear. It's pervasive in every instance of how it works. The idea of danger hitting you at home is almost primal, and to see the home of the Nostromo attacked from the outside in so many ways, as well as the bodies of those crewing it, is the foundation of what gives the movie its visceral power.Those ideas would be nothing, though, if the movie built on them weren't well done, and Alien is a triumph of design. From the lived in and grimy feel of life on the Nostromo (at least partially influenced by the design of Star Wars) to the alien vessel that does a wonderful job of feeling otherworldly, and to the fantastic creature effects that are filmed perfectly to highlight them in just the right ways, Ridley Scott brings a level of sophistication to the visual world that heightens the experience, sells the reality, and deepens the terror. One of the more interesting subtle things Scott does is how he frames the characters. At the beginning, everyone's filmed rather flatly. Ash stands out a bit, but everyone else, especially in the first scene at the dinner table, shows the rest of the crew in the same clarity. No one really stands out, but as the movie goes on, the crew diminishes, and Ripley asserts herself more, she gains more of the frame. There's also the bit where she makes the final plan with three others in the room. For much of the scene, she's the only person in the foreground and everything and everyone behind her is completely out of focus.I also want to put special focus on the final sequence on the Nostromo from the point Ripley starts the auto-destruct sequence until she leaves on the lifeboat. It's purely an audio and visual assault on the senses, and it works perfectly. Tension is already super high and we get this regular beat of strobes and a loud alarm that just reaches out and grabs the audience. With the alien just around the corner as well, it's one of the greatest audio and visual tour de forces in popular cinema.Tone is handled pitch perfectly with unease seeping into every scene, and the lighter scenes never really getting that light. Acting is top notch (the Harry Dean Stanton rule definitely applies here). Everything about this movie works just so incredibly well, creating a complete package of terror based on familiar fears in an unfamiliar setting. I consider it one of the great movies.","

"Alien","freemantle_uk","8 August 2009","Alien is a special film, a hybrid of sci-fi, horror and thriller. A film that made Ridley Scott a Hollywood player, made Sigourney Weaver's career and a started a multi-million dollar franchise.Set in the future, a commercial mining spaceship, Nostromo, is on its way back to Earth and the crew is in a state of hibernation. The ship's computer receives a signal for a foreign species and wakes up the crew. Under law the crew have to investigate. After crashing on a planet some of the crew go to explore the site of a crashed ship, with one very dead alien on board. One of the crew members, Kane (John Hurt) has the misfortune to find a number of eggs in ship and gets attacked by a Facehugger. Kane is taken back to Nostromo, and the science officer Ash (Ian Holm) tries to study it. He can't remove the Facehugger because it would strangle Kane, and cutting it off isn't an option because it has acid blood. After Kane seems to be fine, but whilst eating the Chestburster kills him and scares the crew in a classic scene. The crew go on the hunt, facing the ultimate predator. But it's not just the alien that the crew should worry about, with a conspiracy led by their own company/employers and a traitor within their mitts.Alien is considered a classic and I admit it is very good, but it's my second film in the franchise. The point of this film is the suspense, nothing knowing what's going to happen and has some excellent scares and scenes. Ridley Scott directs with subtly and slowly builds up the film, keeping you on the edge of your seat and interested at work's going on the screen. It is eerie and perfectly well done. As a horror film its one of the best ever made. It's an excellent sci-fi, Ridley Scott creates a break, dark world, showing space travel can be hard and unglamourous, almost an anti-Star Wars film. The story is simple and strong, a spaceship crew find an alien. But what makes Alien better is that the alien is just a wild animal who want to kill and eat. It's not an intelligence life-form who wants to conqueror Earth. The characters are developed and the conspiracy adds to the story, having an anti-big business message. Another theme that are looked at by this film are fear of the unknown, the future of space exploration and the fear of male rape and pregnancy (i.e. what happens to John Hurt). The art direction is excellent, with great sets and model work, adding to the dark Star Wars feel to the film. There is great special effects for the time.They is a good cast to the film. Sigourney Weaver is obviously good and must have loved the role seeing she played it for times. There are great English actors, John Hurt and Ian Holm, both always good to see. Tom Skerritt and Yaphet Kotto are also noticeable and worthy of mention.An excellent film for horror and sci-fi fans. A must see. Alien and Aliens are the best in the series and it's best to stop there.","

"Alien","fredrikgunerius","7 August 2023","With Alien, director Ridley Scott and producer Walter Hill brought B-movie sci-fi horror and the female action hero to mainstream cinema, with first-grade contemporary visual effects as catalyst for the movie's effect and remarkable success. The title character was a villain in the simplest sense; driven by reproduction and self-preservation - basic human needs made into horror. Alien salutes and nourishes off of xenophobia; everything unknown and not human should be feared, lest you end up as some of the more gullible of these crew members. Ridley Scott appeals to your most basal emotions, and probably gets the response he seeks. Luckily, we have Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley as our saviour - she's not only cool and emotionally controlled, she's also forward-looking and considerate, like an amalgam of classical male and female virtues. She became a feminist icon for all the right reasons - she's not a dissident, she's a confident go-getter in an unforgiving world. And she can even put up with being desired - in her underwear - by her viewers. Perhaps because she's just as unattainable for her admirers and for her critics as she is for the alien.","

"Alien","VikiLauda","11 March 2021","Yes! It was such a disapointment...That I was only 12 when this movie was released, so I never got to see it on the big screen!Alien is my all time number 1 favorite horror/sci fi & this cinematic perfection would go on, not only to produce an awesome franchise, but it also set a standard for horror/sci fi movie making for years to come. I first saw this in the early 80's on late night TV, watching it with my dad, & just 30 minutes in I had fallen head over heels in love. I loved the story, the amazing characters, the acting, the atmosphere & the beautiful music. The Nostromo appears huge but it gives us an unnerving, almost panic attack inducing sense of claustrophobia with some perfect hand held camera work by Scott himself, which makes you feel as if your actually part the crew. The story is beautifully concieved with a simplistic yet severe brilliance of mind, & the acting from all the cast was absolutely superb. This movie introduced also me to the work of Ian Holm which I still enjoy today. & we must also not forget the stunning work of the sadly late Bolaji Badejo who brought us the Alien itself. May God rest your soul sir.Alien tells the story of a deep space mining refinary ship & its crew, who are woken from hypersleep as the ship has decteted a signal from a nearby plaetoid which, at first they think it may be a distress call. The ship detaches from the main plaform & lands & it is decided a small scouting party will go out on foot to investigate. They discover a cave with thousands of eggs & Kane (John Hurt) goes into investigate further, when a hand like creature springs on a coiled tail, & attaches itself to Kane's helmet, burning through the faceplate to attach itself to his face. The three make it back to the ship only to be told they will have to quarrentine by Ripley (Weaver) however her order is countermanded by Ash (Holm) who opens the airlock & lets them & the creature onboard...I literally can not find fault with this classic, except that still, after all these years I can watch this time & again & never stop enoying it. Alien showcases some of the finest talent in movie making both in front of camera & behind it.","

"Alien","HD7","18 June 2019","Alien has something that current horror movies lack and that is fear of the unknown. For a good portion of the movie, we didn't know what the alien looked like. Alien builds up tension by not showing us what the alien looked like or what it was doing.
The characters were amazing during the whole movie. They weren't there just for the alien to kill, they actually had characteristic unique to them. Each character felt real and relatable.
The best part of the movie was definitely the alien. Like I said above the alien was never shown completely without purpose. It was moving with the intention of killing everyone on board.
Ridley Scott direction was excellent. From the atmosphere to how the alien goes on board the ship, everything was on point. I loved the atmosphere of this movie, it was a claustrophobic during most of the movie.
This film is not an action film, so it doesn't have fast sequence moments; this movie takes its time and is a very slow pace. But, that is what makes it work.","

"Alien","Otoboke","1 October 2007","Alien: a true classic for science fiction and cinema in general. Believe it or not but there are reasons behind the recognition that the film has gained, and I'm going to briefly go over just a few of them here as best as I can.The plot of Alien is essentially what a reader back in the 70's summarised as being ""'Jaws' in space"". I like to think it's a little more than that, but that's just me. For me, the story of Alien is absolutely flawless, moving along at a near perfect pace from beginning to end, mixing in great twists along the way and finishing off in a memorable set of scenes that send the entire film off in a masterful finale. The script itself is as tight as one could possibly get and although a lot was improvised, the dialogue works in every scene and helps establish, develop and cement characters nicely. Perhaps the very reason why the script works as well as it does it down to the fact that it focuses on just seven characters, taking time to build them up at a balanced rate throughout the course of the film effectively.It is this great sense of character that allows the viewer to get inside the heads of the crew and experience the terror that they eventually face aboard their ship and in their minds. This is extremely important for 'Alien' because the majority of its horror is predominantly psychological, created through a masterful pacing of suspense that is continually being built up from the very beginning of the story. The character of the Alien itself is also dealt with as well as you could ask, making sure not to develop it too fast, always keeping it some sort of a mystery but at the same time always reaffirming the threat it poses to the crew. The mixture of all these elements is what makes 'Alien' the supreme example of refined atmospheric and psychological horror that it is widely recognised for.On a technical level, Alien succeeds just as well. Nearly every shot during the film is visually interesting and aurally intriguing. Throughout the movie we are placed within the clinical, claustrophobic and alienated corridors and rooms of the crew's ship. Not only does this help add to the already mounting atmosphere, but it often has you looking around, fascinated or curious as to where these people are and what their surroundings are in relation to them. Essentially, much like Ridley's other major sci-fi epic ""Blade Runner"", 'Alien' has a visual style created through it's photography and lighting that I believe is wonderfully timeless. Sure there are a few visual effects that look a little dated these days, but for the most part everything still works fantastically and probably will do so for quite some time to come.Performances from the cast are perfect too, with no real stand outs from any because I believe all give their absolute best here and it shows and pays off greatly. Oh, and who can forget that absolutely amazing design for the big guy himself, Alien. Back in the day, this was an absolute masterpiece in 'monster' design, and still is today with the help of the film's great lighting and photography.These are just a few brief reasons as to why Alien is one of the best films of all time, but hopefully you can understand from them, a little of why and how it was achieved and why I regard this amongst my most favourites of films. This is required watching for everyone, film buff or casual popcorn enthusiast. Get watching and be amazed!","

"Alien","allmoviesfan","20 December 2023","Thirty four years on, Ridley Scott's 'Alien' is still brilliant. It's been a minute or ten years since I last watched the movie that has so far spawned five sequels or prequels (with more on the way) and in that time I somehow forget exactly how good it is, even though some of the jaw-dropping scenes are less potent than they might otherwise have been, only because I kind-of know what's going to happen.That said, I can only imagine how terrifying it must have been for those folks watching it at the cinemas on the big screen in 1979 with no inkling of what was to come, each scene more tense and unnerving than the one before. As the crew of the Nostromo land on an unknown planet and end up bringing a merciless alien creature aboard.The ship seems more and more claustrophobic with each scene of the slow-burn horror/sci-fi/action thriller, as the alien takes out one crewmember after another until only Sigourney Weaver's (now-iconic) Ellen Ripley remains.What a ride.","

"Alien","aidanratesmovies","17 October 2021","An iconic classic, still timeless to this day, Alien works past its slow burn nature to still prove to be an interesting and intense little sci-fi horror flick that is bound to please audiences everywhere. First off, Ridley Scott is easily one of my favorite directors, so it's easy to say for me that his creative brilliance is easily one of the most impressive things about this film. The tone is perfectly executed, and the worldbuilding is endlessly engaging and interesting. Scott doesn't expect his audience to be idiots, and therefore the film is full of clever tactics and not repetitive of dialogue and situations as it easily could have been. The set direction is absolutely outstanding, as well as the look of much of the scenery and the costumes at hand. Its impressive to build a believable sci-fi world around your film, and I strongly feel no film has ever done it better than the Alien franchise (at least most of them anyway). The pacing can be a bit slow at times, mainly towards the middle of the movie, and has a few duller moments. All the actors involved truly give it their all especially lead actress Sigourney Weaver, and Ian Holm as Ash. In the end, Alien manages to still hold up today as a classic alien thriller- and is easily some of director Ridley Scott's best work.My Rating: 9.3/10.","

"Alien","generationofswine","14 January 2019","Horror in Space, that's what this is. It's a space monster movie, and the thing is, if you see Aliens, or most of the other Alien related films BEFORE you see this one, you're going to be expecting something completely different.But what you have is a horror movie set on a space ship with an atmosphere so thick that you could cut it with a knife.You can taste the eerie tension when you watch it...and, at least in my eyes, that makes it better than the over-the-top Space Marines that you see in the later installments.And, no questions are answered. There is no broad sweeping mythology. There is only the movie, there is only the monster, there is only the fear and tension. But that is all the movie needs.It's just science-fiction and scary. It's a brilliant merger.But, don't listen to the people making it out to be more than it is. It's really ONLY a horror movie in space and nothing more. That doesn't make it any less enjoyable, but it does make it completely confusing when you read reviews that make it out to be more than an exceptional monster movie.","

"Alien","Dutch90","2 April 2018","The wave of horror films from the 70s and 80s was filled with what many would consider classics. Halloween, Hellraiser, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare On Elm Street and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are all entrenched in the public consciousness and a must see for any film fanatic. But few of these, even the really good ones, rise above the level of 'cult' classic - they have a dedicated fan following and are certainly good films in their own right, but never really rise above their genre. Needless to say, the *true* horror classics hail from the black and white era of the 30s, 40s and 50s, but I'm specifically referring to the 70s/80s wave here. In my book, three of those rose above the level of cult classic, to become true film classics - The Thing, The Excorcist and Alien. And Alien is the one to rule them all.In many ways, Alien is the base on which every sci-fi horror film of the past forty years was built. Every film made in this genre, no matter how innovative in other areas, rips off Alien in *some* way at least. From the unique design, courtesy of the late H.R. Giger, to the bleak and pessimistic future set design - even more so than the grimy 'used future' and interstellar warfare of Star Wars, Alien is the true antithesis to the giddy optimism of Star Trek - and the greedy corporation trying to exploit the beast at the expense of the characters, and humanity at large. Watching it now, it may seem like you've seen all this before - but that's only because so many others learned it from Alien.Story-wise, Alien is not much to look at. Though innovative at the time, it is a very basic 'space-explorers-encounter-a-deadly-organism' tale that we've become familiar with by now. The brilliance lies in the execution - Jerry Goldsmith's creepy score, Ridley Scott's slow, atmospheric direction and the authenticity of the characters. Alien's characters aren't particularly developed, but engaging all the same. We get to know them not through deep backstories or dramatic character arcs, but their interactions - including several improvised scenes - which showcase them as relatable, working class everymen. These aren't the mystic heroes of Star Wars on a quest to save the galaxy, or the elite Starfleet captains commanding a ship exploring the vast reaches of space - these are your everyday working stiffs, sent out to the middle of nowhere on a gig. Space holds no enthralling mystery to them - it's their working environment, much like sailors out at sea. And when they encounter a dilapidated alien vessel on a barren planet, there is none of the exciting mystery of many space exploration tales - rather, there is a sense of impending doom. And we see their very human reactions when they encounter this fearsome extraterrestrial predator - fear, anger and desperation. This is not the childlike wonder of first contact, but the terror of being trapped in a tin can with an animal trying to eat you. As icing to the cake, there is no real 'hero' to the story. Ellen Ripley, played brilliantly by Sigourney Weaver - by now synonymous with the Alien franchise - does not emerge as a 'natural leader' among the group. In fact, she doesn't really lead at all - she becomes the story's sole survivor mainly through happenstance, because she is fortunate enough to not be in the wrong place when the Alien comes out, and spends enough time studying it to figure out a way to outsmart it. Later films elevated Ripley to a more mythical status as the woman who kept surviving the Alien incursions, taking away from her human vulnerability in this film.None of this would be as effective without the film's briljant creature design and special effects. Making the most of its modest budget (reportedly, Ridley Scott built the Space Jockey set without full permission from the studio) and using SFX both sparingly and effectively, Alien has managed to stand the test of time much better than its 1986 sequel Aliens. H.R. Giger's creepy, sexually charged design - inspired both by outlandish fetishes and deep phobias of rape - has not been matched in the decades after, though many have tried. This isn't a cheesy green space invader with a laser gun, but an *animal* - a fierce creature, trying to feed, survive and procreate. The humans it encounters are no mortal enemies or puny natives to be conquered, but either prey or merely in the way. In fact, it isn't really an evil monster - it's just doing what it does to survive. This, in fact, makes it a more effective antagonist rather than if it were just your average creepy space man. Later films respected this core foundation, but unfortunately moved away from the ilusive, deceptive nature of the Alien and turned into insectoid cannon fodder, dangerous mainly because of its large numbers. It's easy to forget that, at its core, Alien is supposed to be about suspense instead of action. No film, both within the series and outside it, has ever matched the briljant effectiveness of Alien. It is a film that was never meant to be A-list, but became so anyway because it was just executed so well. This is truly one for the ages, and a must-watch even if sci-fi and horror don't appeal to you.","

"Alien","hu675","29 August 2005","This classic Sci-Fi/Horror/Thriller is a relentless suspense film is about a group of Space Explorers (Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Veronica Crtwright, Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton and John Hurt) are in a routine mission that accidentally bring aboard an extremely dangerous and adaptable life form.Directed by Ridley Scott (Black Hawn Down, Blade Runner, Legend) made an excellent Sci-Fi/Horror/Thriller. This was one of the most original and best films of 1979. The cast are extremely good (Especially Weaver in her first lead role). The film has an unforgettable scene with John Hurt in the dinner table is a knockout. It was great seeing the fold print of Alien, which i had the chance to see it in a special theater with fans from the first film, it was great. Although i didn't have a chance to see the Director's Cut, when it was re-release in 2003.The original 1999 DVD has an strong anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and the original-Dolby Stereo 2.0 Surround Sound. The DVD has an not-bad running commentary track by the director. The DVD also has Deleted Scenes, Outtakes and more. The film won an Oscar fro Best Visual Effects. The film was also nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration. This DVD is digitally remastered in THX Picture Quality and Sound.The new two disc set of Alien has the Original Theatrical Cut and the Director's Cut.

"Alien","heverett-10426","21 August 2020","Directed by Ridley Scott, Alien remains one of the most influential sci-fi and horror movies of all time. The plot is very simple. After responding to an unknown transmission, the crew of a commercial starship realizes they have an unwelcome guest, a terrifying alien killing-machine. In the first act, the crew members are presented as relatable, human characters. As a result, we sympathize with them for the rest of the movie. The acting, especially by Sigourney Weaver, is very good. Weaver plays her character with authority and fearlessness, which was very uncommon for female characters of the time.While the plot and acting are strong, what really stands out about the movie are the special effects and production design. Every single set-piece is meticulously crafted and filled with detail. The special effects on the aliens are top-notch and still hold up today. Ridley Scott is able to utilize all of this to create a highly suspenseful and terrifying movie. Scott creates an ominous mood, shooting scenes in darkly lit rooms, accompanied by a haunting score. He builds suspense through slow editing, long-takes and close-ups. In the finale, shaky-cam and strobing lights create an atmosphere of chaos and terror. Things like a beeping radar greatly elevate the suspense. By far the scariest moment of the film was the chestbuster scene. Scott creates a lively atmosphere as we see the crew bonding, and then subverts our expectations in a scene filled with sudden violence and terror. A must-see.","

"Alien","eric262003","7 November 2023","Two of the essential ingredients for a film to achieve the approval of the fans is when you juxtapose entertainment with artistic integrity. Of all the genres science-fiction can be the complex films to achieve that goal, but when it succeeds it can be quite rewarding. In 1979, director Ridley Scoot made his directorial debut on North American soil with ""Alien"". From a viewer's standpoint, it looks like a simple sci-fi creature feature picture as the crew from a financially unstable spaceship must battle a deadly alien creature that has found a way to get in their ship. What makes this movie a success is that the detail that was put into the story that has made it an iconic staple in the sci-fi genre. Everything about the creature works effectively from its ugly character design, to its deadly intentions and its hiss gives the Xenomorph a well-earned place in the annals of classic movie monsters.The story is about the crew on The Nostromo are on their way back home to Earth. While they were deep in their hyper sleep a S. O. S. Transmission is ignited and an unknown vessel has arrived. After further research they discover upon a hidious alien creature that has an endless craving for blood and death. Under the leadership of Captain Dallas (Tom Skeritt) and his second-in-charge Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), they are now faced with danger as they must survive against an entity that is almost unbeatable and hard to comprehend. This commercial crew is the unfortunate underfogs as they never in their lives have met anything so enigmatic or dangerous.""Alien"" is obviously one of the most hardcore sci-fi movies ever been made. The opening sequences before the monster makes its way in has great moments of unsettling vibes. Even when we reach the end there is no general conclusion as we assume that there is something more out there that has been given to us in this wild roller-coaster of excitement and gruesome terror. The intensity level is raw, unsettling, and very graphic in detail. Even from the inside of the ship, Scott takes advantage to how very condemned this ship really is and how the crew will manage to survive considering the limited communication devices that are on this commercial spaceship and the limited technology that have to survive this deadly predicament no one was really prepared for.The whole voyage to space truly exhibits psychological effects that the crew undertakes as we get the gist of lonliness and isolation that garners quite a great feeling of sympathy for them. Being away from home with little or no contact from inside their ship, sometimes you have to wonder if your dreams of being in space an honour or a nightmare. In this case of the crew from the Nostromo, it's a hellish nightmare once the evil creature enters their lives.To get any feeling for anything considered sympathetic, we must have to depend solely on the very small crew. Though there is no true hero depicted here, the crew is still the ones we must trust if ever they are to survive the trenches of space and while encountering the monster. Though there may be very little in terms of character backstory, they do speak out in terms of interacting with one another which is good enough to get a bit of understanding why they chose this mission. Though some twists happen two-thirds along the way, including one character who is not what they seem, they are in the long run, likable, and we truly care about their well-being.Of course we can't ignore the life of the party now can we? There's a lot going on in the physical and the mental state of The Xenomorph. The physical capabilities depicted in the creature are designed without it looking lopsided or cheesy and all of its attributes come to life in a belivable manner as when up close chills come tingling on my back. The special effects make this monster one of the most feared creatures in movie history and the added features it brings to the space crew is truly amazing. Like I mentioned earlier, the movie is more than just a ""creature feature"" movie, but has some elements of psychological drama as well. The nightmare level as at a fever pitch and no one on board is safe given the circumstances they have encountered.Sure it was released in 1979, and a lot has changed over the years. But ""Alien"" is still en effective film that is still legitimate in this day and age. It combines both the horrors of dealing with a deadly monster while also looking at the emotional scars our astronauts are facing where contact is very limited. In the end, you will likely be uncomfortable once the credit roll.","

"Alien","antonjsw1","1 September 2015","Ridley Scott's first mainstream Hollywood film is still fresh and powerful 30+ years after it was first released. The story of a commercial spaceship crew diverted to explore a distant planet as a result of the detection of mysterious signal getting themselves an extremely unwanted visitor and the subsequent horror than ensues makes this a landmark science fiction horror film. A fairly straightforward plot is helped by Scott creating a truly superb visually arresting atmosphere, thanks to great work by production designer Michael Seymour and cinematographer Derek Van Lint. It starts of epic, then transitions to the mundane, before building a growing sense of uneasiness leading to claustrophobic suspense and dread that just keeps building and building until, in the final act it turns into a nerve-wracking horror- thriller as key characters fight for survival. While Ridley Scott deserves great credit in pulling this all together so well, kudos has also to go to the whole cast for creating a wonderfully naturalistic approach to their roles, and being able to define their characters so uniquely and clearly, even if they are archetypes – Yaphet Kotto as the engineer with a chip on his shoulder regarding the preferential pay that the officers get, who nevertheless when the chips are down does demonstrate heroic qualities; Harry Dean Stanton as the fellow engineer who may have some form of brain damage, possibly brought on by historic substance abuse but knows the mechanics of the ship inside-out; Veronica Cartwright as the ships navigator, who acts as the link to the audience as a professionalism is gradually striped away as she is consumed by fear; Ian Holm as Ash, the enigmatic and quiet science officer who has only just jointed the crew at the start of this journey; John Hurt as the curious, fearless and gung- ho second in command, Tom Skerritt as the level headed, approachable but experienced Captain, and of course Sigourney Weaver (for whom this was her first film in a significant role) as what seems to be the young, less experienced but confident and assertive career-driven up and comer Ripley. The growing tensions between the characters, particularly the way that all the character butt heads with Weaver's character works well in the development of the story, and despite relative inexperience Weaver is terrific in the role, and helped create an iconic character in science fiction that would lead to three sequels. Kudos also has to go to the technical crew for creating a terrific atmosphere for the actors to work in – this was helped by Scott deciding to film the movie in chronological order of the story rather than a more typical logistical shooting order. The decision to hire the dark surreal artist HR Giger certainly brought a fresh new look to science fiction, but Michael Seymour's production design is truly brilliant and the way that the Alien is presented on screen is still pretty much the best – keeping its appearances limited and quick – nerves are so shredded by the end of the movie that seeing the monster in more extended full body shots where it is more obvious that it's a man in suit doesn't pull you out of the picture. Credit has also got to go to the brilliant Oscar winning visual effects team – as well as the aforementioned HR Giger, it also included in-camera effects from both Nick Alder and Brian Johnson, and excellent miniature photography from Dennis Ayling. Alder had cut his teeth as a director of effects photography on the Gerry Anderson TV show 'Space 1999'. After Alien, he has worked as an on-set special effects expert on an array of films including Empire Strikes Back, Conan the Barbarian(1982 version), Legend, Jewel of the Nile, Leon, Braveheart, Lost in Space, Behind Enemy Lines, Blade 2, Underworld, Hellboy, Shanghai Knights, Ghost Rider, and would win a BAFTA for best visual effects for the Luc Besson film The 5th Element. Johnson's early credits including work as a special effects assistant on 2001, before also cutting his teeth on Space 1999 as a 2nd unit director overseeing the visual effects. After Alien he would work on a variety of films including Never-ending Story, Dragonslayer, Slipstream, Dragonheart as well as winning another Oscar for best visual effects for Empire Strikes Back and a BAFTA for his work on Aliens. Carlo Rimbaldi was already an Oscar winning special effects veteran of over 20 films prior to working on Alien, and had just prior to this film completed work on both King Kong (for which he had won his prior Oscar) and Close Encounters. He would go on to win a third academy award for his work on E.T, and would go onto work on Conan the Destroyer and Dune. Denis Ayling followed this film as a cinematographer in British Television. Giger's did occasionally work on other films (creature designer on Alien 3, visual designer on Species) but his legacy is that the basic Alien look and design influence has survived through 3 excellent to OK Alien sequels, two poor Alien v Predator crossover movies, two disappointing Alien prequels, a batch of (very bad) Species sequels. Another noticeable contributor to the film's mood was the music – which should have been credited to Ridley Scott and Editor Terry Rawlings. Jerry Goldsmith's original score was extensively edited, cues moved around and classic music from other compositions fitted into the scores, but nevertheless somehow the music works very well. All of this helped make Alien a truly outstanding movie. The atmosphere created is so visceral that the film always leaves you with an impact after when the film is overOverall a landmark science-fiction classic.","

"Alien","LW-08854","23 December 2023","Alien is a superb horror/scifi film, it's hard to know exactly which it is. The first hour sets up the gritty and grimy world for this team of space travellers. 2001 Space Odyssey this is not. The characters, acting and dialogue all work to convey the new world we find ourselves in yet populated by characters we sort of recognise in all their normality. The way in which scares and tension are pulled off is just masterful directed. You really actually are on the edge of your seat in many scenes. The special effects are nearly all superb, one particular scene has become truly iconic. Ridley has to be one of my favourite characters I think, the way in which the group fight back and the sweat and the grime of this film just make it so memorable. Why do so many modern sci-fi movies look so staged and polished? Alien is rightly considered a true classic of cinema and must surely be considered one the greatest movies of all time in my book. Ridley Scott movies nearly always have superb art design but this really is exceptional.","

As the Xenomorph preyed on each crew member one at a time, it just got scarier and scarier for my 5 year old self... some 43 years later it still gives me the creeps but remains one of the best films I'd ever scene!Alien is most definitely a classic in its own right, Ridley Scott was once quoted in saying his inspiration to Alien were the following films: Star wars, 2001: a Space Odyssey and The Texas chainsaw Massacre. I must say it had the feeling and elements of those films!","

"Alien","Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","27 April 2017","Is it even possible for Ridley Scott to make an unremarkable film? I don't think so. Yes; I'm also including Prometheus in this argument (with the exception of Robin Hood). And Alien showed that Scott was THE MAN when it came to mustering visually impacting science fiction at the cinema. After Star Wars broke new ground for scifi at the movies, along came Alien in 1979; and this film was a totally different beast. And terrifying! Alien is one of the best space-films of the 70s. Its sense of isolation, confinement in the vacuum of space adds to the tension so beautifully well. The crew of mining ship 'Nostromo' are all alone in space until there's a signal coming from an unknown planet. Little do they know that they're about to bring back with them the most dangerous creature in the universe: The Xenomorph, an alien that bleeds acid and can hide easily in such a vast mining ship.Scott made himself a filmmaking star overnight with this film. Thirty-eight years on and he's still at it, with Alien: Covenant on the horizon, still showing himself to be a talented and committed auteur impressing us still.","

"Alien","Mequias","27 January 2024","""Alien"" is one of the few shining pinnacles of not only perfect but industry defining cinema. Regarded as one of the top three greatest horror movies of all time, it's a definite contender for first place. ""Alien"" is exceptional for many reasons, but some notable aspects include an incredible visual landscape that truly gives a sense of atmosphere to the plot; a patient and careful pace thru which attention to detail and a true love of the characters evolves, and, most importantly, a flawless script in which every word is carefully chosen. Plot and subplots are developed and each member of the cast is fleshed out. ""Alien"" sets many standards; not only in moviemaking as a whole, but also in the Horror genre. This film surprises, deceives, concerns and overwhelms.It's hard to find issue with any aspect of ""Alien"" but one shortcoming is the lack of a proper soundtrack. The monster effects are somewhat dated, but can still stand their ground. When a director truly loves his craft, and his producers are smart enough not to interfere, he will attend to every single aspect of a production. When I say that ""Alien"" is a perfect movie, I truly mean it: perfection in cinema is defined by an experience of effortless acting, correct dialogue, flawless cinematography and next to no errors in plot and film. Many examples of this perfection exist, and its sad to see the industry half-bake most of its creations. As an example, the sequel to this movie is an immediate and very apparent drop in quality, but is still miles ahead of anything being filmed today. ""Alien"" is a movie worthy of purchase and repeated viewing, and an example of the wonderful art mankind can achieve.","

Now just 40 years after the original vision, it's hard to write a review or even start to reflect the magnitude of this gigantic, monster of a movie. Perfect set/alien designs by H.R Giger, top-notch acting from an all stellar cast, a fine musical score by Jerry Goldsmith and last but not least, the very film that put Ridley Scott, on the cinematic map. Of an interesting note the great Walter Hill, with no previous experience of the Sci-Fi genre, ended up as the producer (and also writing one of the first drafts). Originally they had scripted the alien to impregnate a female member of the crew but they thought that this most shocking of concepts, was taking it (what is almost a B-movie plot) a bit too far. Still though a stand alone classic, that in space and time will never be forgotten.","

"Alien","invisibleunicornninja","27 October 2018","Before I continue this review, I just want to give a warning to everyone with photosensitive epilepsy. The entire third act of this movie is filtered by strobe lights. If you're sensitive to that kind of thing, then don't watch.Plot and ""Characters"" - I honestly don't mind slow movies, but this is taking it too far. I'm not asking for nonstop action, all I really wanted was some kind of a plot, tension, maybe some world building, and possibly some character development. Just the bare bones that you'd want out of a movie. Unfortunately, this mess contains none of that. The ""plot"" can be summed up in one sentence - ""dumb people find alien, do dumb things then die."" One of the people on the ship turns out to be a robot and it doesn't even have anything to do with anything, it just happens. I've heard people say that these characters are incredibly well-developed, but they aren't. Calling them ""characters"" is an insult to the very word. There is next to nothing that differentiates them from one another. Instead of dull scenes without dialogue or anyone doing anything, this movie really could've used some scenes where the characters interact, express individual motivations, and maybe get some backstory. The start has a vague plot about getting away from the aliens, but but the time one person is left alive, the editor gave up and nothing makes sense. Even the movie knows its being boring too because Ripley strips for no reason and from then on the movie is filmed in a bit of a sexual manner.Sights and Sounds - The visual quality and the effects and the sound design in this movie are all fine. Nothing great, but not bad. Its actually pretty good, considering its age.This movie isn't scary or interesting. Really it commits the biggest crime that a movie can commit - its boring. It does almost nothing that a movie is supposed to do. Even my dad, who was blinded by nostalgia goggles prior to rewatching, realized how bad it is after watching it with me. Anyone who says that this movie is great clearly needs to rewatch it. I don't care that this movie doesn't have nonstop action - there are a lot of movies with lots of action that are boring. Honestly, I have no idea why people hold this trash in such high regard. Maybe it was good at the time, and sure it had some influence on future movies, but it doesn't really have anything else going for it.","

"Alien","Howlin Wolf","8 March 2001","With ""Alien"", Ridley Scott delivered one of the most inventive and atmospheric chillers of modern cinema.   What makes it a classic?  A good script always helps, and this is a cast that refreshingly consists of 'actors' rather than big name stars who can't turn in a performance.  The fact that the principal crew is relatively small also helps because you feel a real sense of loss when one of them is offed. It makes a nice change from horror/monster movies where the hunter has a seemingly indefinite supply of prey to terrorise.   The sets really are pretty cool for a movie made so long ago, and the director exploits the dramatic potential that such a setting provides. There are plenty of shadowy nooks and crannies for the alien to conceal itself in. and Scott knows how to build up the tension gradually, resisting the temptation to rush any encounters with the creature and thus spoil the unsettling mood.   (SPOILERS)   The chest-bursting scene must be one of the most shocking and brilliantly conceived moments in film.  The fact that the alien disappears soon after we see it at this point gives us a chance to absorb what's just happened and to take in the horrified reaction of the crew.  Wonderful.   As mentioned before, the cast are uniformly excellent, with particular standouts being Holm and Weaver.  In Ripley we have a character who just happens to be female and is not a woman because such a decision makes a difference to the actual story (gratuitous vest & knickers scene towards the end excluded)  Weaver is excellent, clearly relishing at the idea of a strong female part, and showing off her talents accordingly.  If it wasn't the money that tempted her back for a fourth time in ""Ressurection"", it was perhaps the mistaken belief that Ripley was still a strong character, instead of the gimmick the studio had by then made her.  I can easily tell people who my favourite actors are, but when the same is asked of actresses I struggle; NOT because there are no good ones out there, but because they are rarely given the roles to shine.  Show me a Hollywood actress with a consistently good (and high profile) body of work.  I'm tempted to cite Sigourney as my favourite actress on the strength of the first three Alien movies alone, but she's rarely had a role as good as Ripley since ""Aliens""   I marginally prefer the all-action sequel to this, but it's a close call. This takes a fairly unoriginal idea and exploits every last drop of tension from it until the climax.  The movie will leave you sweating.  Great stuff.","

"Alien","mateusolivotti","9 October 2020","Alien is certainly one of the most striking and influential sci-fi films of all time, after all, the feature film released in 1979 serves as inspiration for several current films and series. Undoubtedly one of the things that stand out the most in the film is its simply incredible practical effects, the film was released over 40 years ago and even today they are incredible, and of course, the film would be nothing but Ridley Scott's direction that unlike many films at the time, the director prefers to leave a mystery around the creature, which really reveals itself only at the end of the film.
In my opinion, the only reason this film is not perfect is that it has at least 4 or 5 minutes more than it should have, there is a scene at the end of the film that would be perfect if it ended there, but instead the film he decides to continue with one more threat, which he resolves until quickly.","

"Alien","Screen_Blitz","2 May 2017","Since H.G. Wells's classic novel 'War of The Worlds', aliens have been one of the most iconic fictional creatures to stand the test of time in the science-fiction genre. This sci-fi/horror creature feature takes the trophy of not only marking a solid directorial inauguration for Ridley Scott, but also for redefining the alien subgenre. This spine-chilling alien invasion piece not only shows off Scott's versatile directing chops, but also serves as an influential classic to inspiring many sci-fi/horror tropes of the past few decades. Although some may admire the director's visceral blend of sheering suspense and startling visual effects as the movie's most valued accolade, it is difficult to argue the astonishing influence that this film has spread over the past many years; especially when you look at the large number of cheesy rip- offs Hollywood has flown at us. This film centers on a commercial crew of seven members travelling through space on a spaceship known as the Nostromo. The crew is lead by Captain Dallas (Played by Tom Skeritt) and consists of members Ellen Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver), Lambert (played by Veronica Cartwright), Brett (played by Harry Dean Stanton), Kane (played by John Hurt), Ash (played by Ian Holm), and Parker (played by Yaphet Kotto). When the crew receives a distress signal from an unknown source, they soon become terrorized by a mysterious extraterrestrial force that manages to sneak their way on the ship.If you picture John Carpenter's 'Halloween' and replace the masked killer with a grotesque-looking extraterrestrial and the suburban setting with the interior of a rundown spaceship, then you got this movie. This film is a terrifying ride. It focuses on the survival of seven individuals who are forced to use their intellect and weaponry to fend off against an otherwordly force that is beyond what they imagined. Ridley Scott effectively sets the action in an inspiring hodgepodge of firmly constructed atmosphere and a surplus of horrifying special effects. Similar to Steven Spielberg's method in 'Jaws', Scott makes a smart decision of not displaying the monster throughout the entirety the film, but generating a chilling wind of suspense that effectively builds up when the extraterrestrial creature finally shows itself on screen. When the creature reveals itself, it is brutally terrifying especially when the considered the surrealistic design of the sinister creature. And best of all, the creature serves perhaps not just as a cold-blooded killer but a moving force of the sinister atmosphere. Scott's methodology awards us with a powerful string of scares and thrills including the infamous chest-bursting scene. As for the acting department, the cast does mostly fine, but the shortage of character development does serve as a small hinder. The only one who manages to sustain a proper characterization is Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley who displays plenty of grit and heart in her tough female role.Alien marks not only a scary, heart-pounding science-fiction set piece, but an influential sci-fi/horror cinematic entry. It is an amazing work of art that boasts the incredible talent of visionary director Ridley Scott. Although it certainly shows its age, it is effective enough to leave moviegoers pining for more.","

"Alien","gab-14712","18 October 2017","""Jaws in Space."" The perfect three words to describe 1979's unique Alien. If you look at it closely, Alien is very similar to Jaws. An abnormal giant creature is terrorizing a bunch of innocent humans, and even the introduction to each monster is eerily similar. I really dig the influences that Jaws made on Alien. I liked how they hid the alien until the end, where we finally get to see him in all his grotesque glory. The 1970's was a hard time for sci-fi. Not many science fiction movies were made in the midst of American exploitation films, but luckily Star Wars and Close Encounters changed everything. Because of the success of those films, one of the best sci-fi/horror classics of the twentieth century was able to get produced. I am not much of a horror guy but if you are able to add a science-fiction element to the horror and actually make it good, well you can count me in. I enjoyed nearly everything about this film from start to finish.One of the film's best strengths is its pacing. It moves purposely at a slow pace. People would expect the movie to be about the alien from the start, but the alien does not begin its reign of terror until the movie has been running for a good amount of time. But we are treated to wonderful characterizations (conversations on money shares), the silence of space, and the anticipation of what will happen next. But from the start, it's worth investing your time into the characters of the ship, The Nostromo. Another strength is the production design thanks in part to designer H.R Geiger. The Nostromo has a wonderful design to it and you can tell the influences from Star Wars. But what about the creature himself? My goodness, they are scary-looking creatures. From the harmless looking chest-burster to the killing machine that is called the Alien, they are visually disgusting creatures (in a good way). In today's day and age of movies, the visual effects still hold up very well. The effects actually won an Oscar.The Nostromo is a commercial deep-space vessel on its way home when it picks up an SOS signal from a distant planet. The SOS signal awakens the crew from their deep hypersleep way earlier than anticipated, The seven-man crew is led by Dallas (Tom Skerritt) and the rest of the crew consists of Ripley (Signourey Weaver), Lambert (Veronica Cartwright), Brett (Harry Dean Stanton), Kane (John Hurt), Ash (Ian Holm), and Parker (Yaphet Kotto). Once they get to the signal, they realize that this was not an SOS signal at all. It was a signal of danger now that a very dangerous lifeform is a stowaway on their ship. Will they be able to destroy the alien before they get destroyed themselves? Another reason why the movie works so well is the presence of a strong female lead character. So we have ourselves a 70's rarity: a female-driven science-fiction movie. Signourey Weaver's Ripley plays out like a character straight out of a 1950's movie and I love it. Ripley is a hero worth remembering in future movies. Weaver is the most important character of the movie, but let's not forget about the rest of the cast. I find the ages of everybody interesting. A typical horror or thriller movie has most of their characters between 20-30. Outside of Weaver and Cartwright, everyone is 35 or older. I liked that because they added experience to their characters thus making us care more about their fates. Ian Holm was the oldest cast member at 46, and is the second most important character. His character is actually an android and his profession is a science officer. So you might have the feeling he will play a pivotal role with the alien (and the humans) fates. I must give a shout-out to John Hurt for taking it so well the fate of his character, Kane. Kane happened to be the lucky fellow involved in the horrifying chest-bursting sequence. I've seen this movie several times and the shock value of this scene still remains at a high point.This movie was directed by Ridley Scott, whom would go on to have an impressive career in Hollywood. But this movie is where he was mostly introduced to the film world. He did one hell of a job directing the movie. This movie could have easily been a movie with cheap scares, but he grounded the movie. He made it much more than just the alien. In a way, you can count this as another similarity to Jaws. That shark movie began the mighty career of Steven Spielberg..just like this film did with Ridley Scott.Overall, I really enjoyed Alien so much. This movie spawned many sequels and spin-offs, but none of them impacted me like this movie did although 1986's Aliens is also a classic. The movie is scary and thrilling, but Ridley Scott's powerful directing and Signourey Weaver's acting prowess did much to elevate the movie. Then there was the impressive visuals, the good use of sound (a smooth mixture of silence and Jerry Goldsmith's score), the good script by Dan O'Bannon. This is really an unforgettable classic and its up there with Jaws (yep, I mentioned it again) as my favorite horror movies from the 1970s'. If these kind of films have a good story, then you bet I'll like them.My Grade: A","

"Alien","bankofmarquis","22 February 2020","I convinced my cynical 19 year old to watch an ""ancient"" film (her phrase) - so I was careful with my choice. I know she likes horror, so thought I would try to see if she could be scared the old fashioned way and pulled the 1979 Sci-Fi/Horror classic ALIEN off the shelves to show her.It scared the crap outta her.Directed by Ridley Scott (more on him later) Alien tells the tale of a working-class deep space vehicle, returning home with a full cargo when they intercept a distress call at a distant, non-descript planet, they go to investigate and...As told by Ridley Scott, based on a script and story by Dan O'Bannon, Alien is a masterwork in suspense and mood. Scott takes his time telling this story, setting up the feel and atmosphere, showing a gritty, working-man's vessel (and not a sleek silver and chrome shiny ship) where the people inside the craft are not heroes, but working class stiff's just trying to make a buck.What surprised me this time around seeing this film is how deliberate (some would say slow) that the pacing of this film is - but, darn it all, if it doesn't work. The tension slowly builds so when violence/action happens it explodes and seems all the bigger due to the fact that it is coming out of silence.The cast - a group of relative unknowns at the time - is stellar. In the DVD commentary, Director Scott said he spent quite a bit of time casting this film to ensure he had the right mix - and his work shows on screen. The 7 actors in this film work well together - and each one of them brings a real character to the screen that is interesting to watch.Tom Skerrit (the film version of M*A*S*H) as laconic, laid back Captain Dallas and Yaphet Kotto (the villain in the James Bond flick LIVE AND LET DIE) as gruff, looking-for-a-buck mechanic Parker were the most well known of the 7 at the time of the release of the film - and they do bring some star power to the proceedings, but are met, evenly, by others like former child star Veronica Cartwright (Alfred Hitchcock's THE BIRDS), veteran character Actor Harry Dean Stanton ( THE ROSE) and John Hurt (THE ELEPHANT MAN). All 3 bring interesting characters - and faces - to the proceedings.But...for me 2 the standouts in this cast is IAN HOLM (TIME BANDITS) as Science Officer Ash - a character with some ""quirks"" (to put it mildly) and, of course Sigourney Weaver (GHOSTBUSTERS) in her star making role as 3rd officer Ripley. I don't want to spoil anything in this film, but Weaver's Ripley is the type of strong female character - fighting the typical, chauvinistic male hierarchy - that was heretofore unknown/rarely seen in film and is the prototype of these types of characters to this day. Weaver's performance and the writing and direction of this character is that strong/groundbreaking that it continues to influence writing and filmmaking all these years later.The 8th character in this film is the look and feel of the ship - the Nostromo - and the look and feel of the titular Alien character as brought to life in an Oscar winning effort in Visual Effects for the team of H.R. Giger, Carlo Rambaldi, Brian Johnson, Nick Allder and Dennis Ayling (based on drawings by Giger). This is truly remarkable, bravura and groundbreaking design and filmmaking - one that holds up very well more than 40 years later - made all the more astounding when you realize that these are all practical effects (CGI had not be invented yet) and the filmmakers had to rely on puppetry, editing, performance and what you don't see (but your mind thinks you do) to fill in the gaps.It all works tremendously well - if you haven't seen this in awhile, do yourself a favor and watch it again. If you have never seen it, well...you are in for a treat.Letter Grade: A+10 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","

"Alien","Benjamin-M-Weilert","8 March 2019","Science fiction in film has faced an uphill battle in terms of being taken seriously. Up until the late 1960's, most sci-fi was low-budget, B-movie schlock more likely to be Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fodder than Oscar potential. This all changed in 1968 with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Now that sci-fi could be considered art it took almost a decade for other films to capitalize on Kubrick's groundbreaking work. Star Wars (1977) expanded on the special effects and made sci-fi a fun, action-filled ride. Regarding the horror aspect of sci-fi, Alien (1979) remains the founding film of these combined genres.Not only does Ridley Scott do a fantastic job directing this movie, in particular through the use of elaborate sets, puppetry, and just plain spectacular cinematography; but the fact that Alien has an incredibly strong female protagonist (Sigourney Weaver's Ripley) puts it leagues ahead of its time in terms of character-driven plot. The fact that she was brought back for the James Cameron sequel, Aliens (1986), is merely a testament to how strong her character's impact on the original film was. Of course, part of the reason Ripley stood out as a unique personality was due to the antagonist: the eponymous Alien.The horror of the unseen remains the best technique to build suspense, but the gruesome visage of this creature delivers all the horror the plot had built up. Unlike some of the B-movie horror of earlier decades, this monster is realistic enough to give a legitimate scare without giving away the puppetry technique behind it via poorly designed costumes or visible support wires. The fact that this alien is nigh indestructible (and has acid for blood in case it does get injured) merely adds to the terror of it running rampant on a cramped spaceship.The epitome of the sci-fi/horror sub-genre, I give Alien 5.0 stars out of 5.","

Even at the very end of the film it was supenceful. The end where she had to escape the ship before it explodes was amazing. When it get revealed that the Alien was on the escape ship the whole time is absolutely terrifying. My favorite part of the Masterpiece that is this film is the end.

"Alien","writtenbymkm-583-902097","4 June 2016","SPOILER ALERT. I suppose it's asking too much to want a sci-fi movie that's halfway intelligent. ""Alien"" is not. If you start thinking about this movie, it falls apart. I'll try to be brief. One, if I'm not missing something, the ""Company"" that owns the spaceship knows about this horrible alien monster, knows it ""can't be killed"" (Ash, the robot, actually says this), and wants the monster brought back to Earth, ""crew expendable."" Question, if the monster can't be killed, but it kills each and every human it sees, how the heck are they going to get it off the spaceship when it gets back to Earth? And what will they do with it then? That's absurd. Two, how does the Company know the spaceship crew will even get the monster on board to bring it back in the first place? There's no way at all for the Company to assume this. Three, the only reason the monster got inside the spaceship was because of an incredibly stupid thing one of the crew did. If you were on an unknown alien planet and you saw some ""eggs,"" would you try to go down and sniff at them and put your face as close to them as possible? And when one of them started to open, would you just stand there and get even closer to it? This is beyond stupid, it's insane. Four, once the monster is on the ship and hugging this guy's face, it disappears, and suddenly another monster pops out of his chest. Seriously? This rather sizable alien being with a big ugly head has been living inside a man's chest but he never felt any pain and none of his organs suffered any damage, not his lungs, not his heart, nothing? I didn't buy that for one second. Five, this creature supposedly has ""molecular acid"" (ha ha) flowing through its body, an acid so strong that it can eat right through steel like a knife through warm butter -- but the creature itself is immune? Right. Six, once the entire crew except for Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is dead, she decides to blow up the ship and escape in the shuttle. So she has to go through a cumbersome series of physical actions, including pulling up big tubes, just to set a destruct signal, and then it gives her ten minutes -- ten minutes, folks -- to go to the bathroom, find her cat, get to the shuttle, strip down to her micro-panties for us, ten minutes. In a sane world, on a sane ship, you'd be able to set the destruct for any time you liked, and you'd be able to get on the shuttle first and then activate the destruct signal. Finally, only a guess from the way they made it look, but evidently the ship was destroyed in a nuclear explosion, while Ripley is still close enough that she (and her cat) would be killed by the radiation. (Even in ""Forbidden Planet"" they knew enough to get the ship far away from the explosion.) So, for all those reasons, this is a movie that is so scientifically stupid and impossible that I couldn't believe it or enjoy it at all. Where are Joel and the bots when you need them? P. S. People smoke cigarettes on a spaceship -- yeah, right.","

"Alien","tnelson2-374-411051","9 December 2021","This film is absolutely awesome. Of that there is no doubt. It is masterpiece level. After all these years do I think it's better than it's 1986 sequel?Maybe it's a little disrespectful opening my review immediately comparing it to Camerons sequel but I see the two movies the most connected of the franchise, despite their differences. You can watch them both and they form an coherent story with a satisfying arc for Ripley that the subsequent sequels largely frittered away.Onto Alien then. This is a seminal film in so many ways. The music, atmosphere and cinematography are all seriously top notch here. Alien is such a great looking and sounding film - Jerry goldsmiths score is superb and really suits it. The sets are excellent and most of the special effects are decent still - there's a few times where you can see it's a guy in a suit and the end explosion looks really poor but on the whole this film still looks great considering it's over 40 years old now.The cast are great all round, and it cleverly doesn't telegraph to you that it's weaver's film from the get go, as for large parts of the runtime she's simply another member of the crew with the other actors getting equal billing and all putting in excellent, realistic performances.I think this film beats aliens on some of the scares and maybe the odd bit of cinematography only. Aliens looks amazing but this looks more rich in places somehow. The design of the ship eschews a gleaming star trek style aesthetic and goes for a grimy, realistic 'lived in' look, similar to the first star wars film.The facehugger and chestburster scenes are utterly iconic and the ensuing tension that follows is superb as the alien silently stalks the crew, who are unaware of it's size or capabilities. The issue is for me is once you know what's coming on subsequent rewatches, it's power is somewhat diminished, but on first watch with no knowledge of the franchise? It's one of the best horror films ever made. It's still a rewatchable film but less so than it's sequel which has 90 percent of the scares, 200 percent of the action, special effects, humour, quotable dialogue and interesting characters in my view.Ultimately, despite my nit picks (and that's all they are) this is still a bona fide classic in every sense of the word and this film rarely puts a foot wrong, if at all. It's responsible for a franchise that lasted over 40 years (and spawned some seriously dubious sequels further down the line) and for that reason it has to be considered a hugely important movie. I just prefer its immediate sequel a little more in terms of overall entertainment, but I highly recommend watching these two films back to back and forget the rest. You won't regret it.","

Constrained by a comparatively small budget,Mr Scott pushed his and his cast and crew's creativity and ingenuity to the limits.Miss Sigourney Weaver seized the opportunity the part of Lt. Ripley provided her to become a beacon for the empowerment of women. The special effects,although small - scale compared to the likes of ""Star Wars"",are beautifully realised and genuinely shocking. ""Alien"" is a haunted house movie set in deep space,Mr Scott's achievement is in spinning that familiar theme to the extent where its very familiarity is hidden by his smoke and mirrors. Mr.James Cameron's ""Aliens"" is flashier,noisier and more populist,but it is the work of an artisan rather than an artist.You get more bang for your buck but it's movie making by numbers. In ""Alien"" Mr Scott's vision comes to fruition in relative austerity, but it remains his vision and not that of a committee,it is a movie made with the eye of an artist,not that of an accountant.","

Claustrophobia can be quite draining - but the set design here ... not even thinking about the low budget, this has aged quite well. What hasn't aged to well are the communication devices (same is true for the sequel). But that is really a small part of the whole experience. The special effects are amazing, the not seeing the Alien suspense much also works.This is a classic and something that while I've heard people call ""boring"", is quite the opposite. Edge of your seat and a cast that is superb, an amazing script and many things just working for it.

"Alien","vittoriocosanostra","28 August 2020","'Alien' (1979) is one of the greatest classics of scientific fiction, and is always indicated for those looking for a masterpiece. Alien is the result of an original concept, a great script, a great direction, the charisma of intelligent characters and one of the best plays of history and cinematic language that I have ever seen.The original soundtrack is incredible. It is grand, existentialist, played in the right moments and gives the film a more frightening tone. It exactly matches the villain Alien, who barely appears, but when he does, it scares anyone. Only the look of it already does that, the way he acts makes science fiction a horror movie.Cinematography? Flawless. Scott's direction made one of the most immersed films I've ever seen (It's just not more immersed than Blade Runner, which by the way is also his). It seems he takes care of everything. The film takes place almost entirely in a spaceship, and it looks like a real spaceship, and that we are in the real future. I can't find so many words to explain it, but it is truly surreal. Those initial scenes of the ship, the scene where they first find the egg, I thought I was seeing 2001. The scenes where the camera revolves around the places, that scene where the camera rotates to show the characters, those sequential shots. .. one of the best done directions i've ever seen. The only thing I didn't think was so good were some action scenes that the camera seemed to be ""out of place"", if I were to talk it would give a spoiler. Not to mention the infamous alien scene coming out of the guy's belly.The story is very good. The characters are not stupid clogs that make stupid decisions, on the contrary: They are interesting and well designed and not stereotyped, I ended up caring for them.Alien is an experience that is not just a story of et, it is the appreciation of art, good ideas (and that become iconic) A result of an excellent mix of technical aspects and a great cast of actors who make great characters and a villain unforgettable. That shows Ridley Scott is a genius, that cinematographic experiences are not just about technique and how ""Alien"" is definitely one of the best films ever made in history.",NA
"Alien","Clockwork_Orange55","5 August 2016","""Alien"" is Ridley Scott's first great feature film, and could probably be his magnum opus if not for ""Blade Runner"", which is the other masterwork of his. Honestly, I cannot be sure if he belongs to the pantheon of great filmmakers or not. He spearheaded near-perfect pictures in his earlier days, but his later works like ""The Counselor"" and ""Exodus: Gods and kings"" are near forgettable. ""Body of Lies"" and ""Robin Hood"" are not very well received either, and Oscar winning ""Gladiator"" is overrated.Undoubtedly ""Alien"" is so influential. It spawned three sequels and one indirect prequel thus far, for which they were helmed by three different film directors except ""Prometheus"", which is also directed by Ridley. Its influence stretched even further when it got expanded into video games and even comics. Thus this inevitably made Ridley to be one of the most respected filmmaker in Hollywood of his times. His success is more to be evident in ""Blade Runner"".""Alien"" is the story of a group of ordinary workers who went missing in the stars. The spacecraft 'Nostromo' is on its way back to Earth when it receives a transmission from a nearby planetoid. Obeying the protocol set by the company, the crew agree to land the ship to inspect on the source. They go out to locate the signal, but to only later realize that they bring back something with them to the ship that would decimate the whole crew.Although Ridley is so-called the leader of the project, it was scriptwriters Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett the ones initiated it. Everything we see in the story, is theirs. ""Alien"" got inspirations from classic sci-fi movies like ""The Thing from Another World"" and ""Forbidden Planet"", despite it being an 'original' story. The product is like when different ideas from different sources assimilated and converted into an ultimate masterpiece. Ridley skillfully visualized the ideas, but ""Alien"" will never happen without the duo.From the horrors to the romanticism of its opening, the film is so grasped of perfection. One of the keys to the film's critical success is its pacing. It seemed to be like a kind of slow-burn horror, which slowly but exceptionally captured the details of the movie; like its filmmaking and narrative thrust that all together built-up in favour of for coherence.It was a smart move for Ridley to not shoot the monster fully on camera, and this helped to preserve the authentic look of the character (Xenomorph). If more physical parts of the monster be brought upon to audiences, then flaws of the design of it can be left not concealed. On the other hand, the sets of the spaceship and planetoid were all well-designed. Ridley's direction furthermore helped to leverage its aesthetic appeal.The superb collaboration of Ridley, its writers, the composer of musical score, designers and crews had made ""Alien"" to be the atmospheric, masterful timeless sci-fi horror. ""Alien"" could easily be a mediocre B movie, but Ridley's brilliant direction turned it into one of the greatest films instead. Who would have had expected that a script not so intricate can be converted into a piece that will stay relevant for decades to come? The feat here is rarely being felt and I doubt that it will happen again. I am so sure that as long as cinema is culturally still important to us, ""Alien"" will never be forgotten.(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com)",NA
"Alien","OneAnjel","18 February 2022","This is the film that launched Sigourney Weaver into stardom. I want to get that out of the way because I notice a lot of reviews claiming she was such a big star gracing this film. She was a virtual unknown at this time, just like most of the cast. Judging by her portfolio over the proceeding years, it was Ridley Scott who made her so wonderful in Alien. Sometimes a star can make a movie; sometimes a movie makes the star. Regardless, Alien was positively mind-bending when it first arrived in theatres, right up there with the impact of films like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Thing, and The Terminator. Many people like to make lists online of their top 50 or 100 greatest sci-fi/horror films and you get all kinds of stuff in there. But if you had to really narrow it down to, say, the top 10, Alien would be in there. Some reviews go on and on about how the premise has been done before, even many times. But I beg to differ. Yes, a group of people trapped somewhere fearing for their lives wasn't new but that's like saying Cast Away is a rip off of The Blue Lagoon. Show me where an alien bursts out of a man's stomach after being implanted in his face for days on board a giant space craft controlled by an artificial lifeform created by the military! Nope. Never seen that before.Every now and then, I watch Alien again. I've seen it a dozen times. It's still an amazing watch even though I know how it ends. Stunning in every detail. I can't really speak to the other films in this franchise. I've watched them and thought they were entertaining. But Alien follows the norm of the first film being the best, imo, and per the ratings on this site. I know the box office ratings will say Aliens was actually higher grossing, but hey - the cost of seeing a film had gone up to $9.50 by then from around $3.50 in 1979. Very rarely does the second film in a franchise outdo the first, but with Saw (arguably, perhaps) and Terminator, that did actually happen. I will say, I think the Alien franchise has gone too far with churning out the next film just to cash in. I'd much rather watch the original.",NA

Rarely has a director built tension so effectively, so dramatically and with such polish as Ridley Scott in Alien.I will add no more, in case of spoilers. But if for some reason you have never seen this film then turn down the lights, turn up the volume and prepared to be terrified! I was just 15 on that day when we first watched it. When the final credits rolled we knew, absolutely knew, that we had just witnessed was one of the classic films in cinema history.Absolute genius.",NA

"Alien","bheadher","4 September 2016","This is the one that set the bar very high for those movies to follow...After so many years, Alien grabs you right from the beginning. Casting was superb, special effects were way out there perfect, and the story simply could not be improved upon...The space commercial tug Nostromo, on it's way back from a stint of ""mineral mining"" operations, is tasked by the ""company"" to investigate a strange alien signal sent out from a planet not far from the tugs course. The crew is comprised of a Captain, First officer, two interestingly rebellious engineers, a planetary engineer, and a strange crew member who apparently is the ships medical Doctor, but later turns out to be a sinister company android.I won't go through the whole screenplay, but this movie was written with the twists and turns of Twilight Zone in mind, it is that good...One thing that amazed me over the years is the incredible detail put forth in the models of both the tug Nostromo, and the complete mining and processing platform it is towing. The exterior and interior shots of the space tug is quite simply ""believable"". It looks like a completely utilitarian workhorse, as it should. You could literally close your eyes and imagine being a crew member in the far future...Alien is the mark that all space operas must live up to now...",NA

"Alien","radhrh","21 July 2022","It's hard to believe Alien is over 40 years old and yet it still looks fresh. With a very few exceptions, for example the computer graphics during the landing sequence, everything looks modern. But Aliens isn't just about the visuals. The plot, although on the face of it simple has layers of complexity. The acting is first rate, the characters believable, the art design amazing and of course it's a Ridley Scott master class in direction. It would all be for nothing however if the eponymous Alien was just a guy in a rubber suit. Indeed it was just a guy in a rubber suit but the way it is shot means you never actually see it untill right at the very end. It's a great example of working within limitations and producing a superior movie as a result. These days with CGI movie makers can more or less show anything they wish but as the likes of Alien Covernent demonstrate that doesn't produce a better movie.",NA
"Alien","dk777","1 February 2021","Great science fiction horror with good actors and great directing. One of the best films whose greatest strength is the atmosphere itself. Tension and claustrophobia are so well portrayed and set an example for all other films of this type. Excellent practical effects in which a lot of effort has been invested. Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley is another great example of how to make a character that everyone loves. A character trying to survive, struggling with fear and an impossible situation in this really tense film. Truly one of the best movie characters ever. An interesting and tense cinematic experience.",NA

"Alien","eibon09","16 November 2001","One of ten important science fiction films ever made with a gripping story, suspenseful situtations, sympathetic performances, and excellent artitect. Changed the way filmmakers in Hollywood and around the world saw at how Science Fiction films should be done.  Alien(1979), 2001:A Space Odyssey(1968), and Metropolis(1926) are the three most copied science fiction films since film was born.  Alien(1979) relies on the psychological reactions of the main people of Captain Dallas, Ripley, Lambert, Brett, Kane, Ash, and Parker.  In the order of what is the best to worst I would go with 1.Aliens(1986), 2.Alien(1979), 3.Alien3(1991), and 4.Alien 4(1998).
The first film is a gothic thriller transported to space.  The designs by HR Giger are a marvel to look at.  Atmosphere and dread are two areas that are the film's strongest points.  Introduced the most famous female figure in a Scifi flick to the person of Ripley.  Early concepts in making the film had Ripley being a man but was changed to make the character a strong but vurnable woman.Inspiration for Alien(1979) is a combination of three films(It!The Terror from Beyond Space[1958], Planet of the Vampires[1966], and Shivers[1975]) which played an important role in the look, feel, mood, and situations of the film.  British flavored Scifi feature for obvious reasons.  Utilizes the music of Mozart to convey the sense of suspense and terror in the story. Mozart's ""Eline Kleine Nachtmusik"" enforces the cold, expecting, and unknown fear felt in the halls of the Nostromo ship.  There are scenes of chilling horror and anticipating terror within the plot.Written with a flair for the imagination by Dan O' Bannon.  Filled with brilliant moments like the alien popping out of the chest of Kane, the death of Brett, and the search in the alien ship where one of the crew members discovers piles of eggs.  In the original script there was a sex scene between Captain Dallas and Ripley that ended up not being filmed.  Its too bad such a scene wasn't done because it would have tighten the tension felt in the triangular relationship of Captain Dallas, Ripley, and Lambert. Also, this scene would explain why Lambert has some resentments towards Ripley.Sigourney Weaver plays the role that made her into a minor star and jump started her career as a serious female acting performer.  Before she became known as the female Rambo in her performance for the sequel, Aliens(1986). Alien(1979), Blade Runner(1982), and Legend(1984) are Ridley Scott's three film masterpieces of his film life.  Certainly a way superior film than Gladiator(2000).  One film that would be excellent in blending Science Fiction with Horror besides and after Alien(1979) is John Carpenter's The Thing(1982) except with a different appoarch.",NA
"Alien","kilgoreboys","4 April 2018","Horror movies today could take a step back, take a long look, and find their own piece to take. Now, of course, I sincerely believe the film industry should try it's best to be original, although let's be honest, that won't happen. Everything in this movie is perfect, I mean that. The script never falls apart with one of the most steady spaced movies I have ever watched. The acting is unknowingly great, depending on your observations of certain characters. The ship is fully developed, with a crew that does not hesitate in any scene with their brilliant chemistry. The ship design feels dirty and lived in, keeping the advanced look. Every time a button is pressed to put in commands or a lever is pulled the ship responds. The Alien design is many peoples favorites, feeling real. For 1979 this movie is revolutionary in visuals and props, never looking too fake. If there is anything I would have to say this movie does best on, it is the cinematography. Derek Vanlint gave the job of a lifetime, alongside Ridley Scott. Alien is one of my favorite movies if you have never watched it....fix that. Alien, of course, gets a perfect score.",NA

It never really appeared appealed to me because I'm just not a big fan of dark, sci-fi movies.They did a great job, creating this tense creepy vibe throughout the whole movie. They were smart, not to give away too much about the alien. They left a lot for the viewer to make up their own decisions on what it was. It really worked.The alien itself. I thought looked a little cheesy. This was back in 1979, so I guess I should give them a little bit of a break. It is looked a little silly.I am afraid I think we've already peaked in the series.",NA
"Alien","kumarkyle","26 September 2023","Alien"" (1979) stands as a seminal triumph of cinematic horror that elevates the science fiction genre to an art form. Directed with meticulous precision by Ridley Scott, this enduring classic seamlessly amalgamates elements of science fiction and horror, engendering an atmosphere of unrelenting trepidation that persists long after the final frame.From a cinematic vantage point, ""Alien"" is an aesthetic tour de force. The Nostromo spacecraft, with its dimly lit, labyrinthine passageways, engenders a palpable sense of isolation and vulnerability. The cinematography, deftly orchestrated by Derek Vanlint, employs chiaroscuro techniques to accentuate suspense, crafting a visual tableau that is both haunting and evocative. H. R. Giger's phantasmagorical creature design is a masterwork of practical effects, with the gradual revelation of the Xenomorph serving to intensify the overarching suspense.Jerry Goldsmith's evocative score elegantly underscores the film's mounting tension, while Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of Ripley stands as an iconic representation of female empowerment within the genre. The film's deliberate pacing ensnares viewers in its suspenseful narrative web, and ""Alien"" undeniably persists as an eternally relevant cinematic magnum opus, rightfully enshrined in the annals of cinematic history.",NA

"Alien","Bababooe","10 August 2017","I watched the 20th anniversary edition, on 7/17/15 & 8/11/17. Both times sucked.Fancy set designs and props, that's it. Acting sucks. Most are known actors. The problem? The freaking director, Ridley Scott! Boring dialogue and characters.Cafeteria scene - they're arguing about bonuses. 10 minutes to land the freaking ship. Do we need that? No.Boring but functional cinematography. Audio sucked. Mix of dialogue/sound effects and music crap. Music was OK, nothing special.Lighting is crap. After ship lands scene with Ian Holm/Ash/Robot, super white bright. Monitor shot of ship distorted and annoying.Sigourney Weaver/Ripley confronts Ash/Robot about why he opened the door to let the contaminated astronauts into the spaceship. She's in charge when the captain is out of the ship, broke protocol. Painful stuff.Acid on pencil scene.Yaphet Kotto/Parker has a great idea that nobody listens to - ""freeze John Hurt/Kane till we get home"".Hurt wakes up, nobody does another x-ray. Hurt chestbust in the cafeteria, disgusting, stupid. More props.Harry Dean Stanton/Brett comes up with cow shock sticks to attack the alien. More props.Cat in the locker scare! How did he get in there? Stanton searches for the cat (Cat Search I). Alien is now giant. How is that possible? No explanation, 1 foot to 10 feet?Here's more stupidity: Water dripping from somewhere, maybe a cargo, who knows. Stanton washes his face like its fresh rain, it's more like a leaking pipe or sewer. Alien comes out - very cool. Props! Stanton is dead.Here's another stupid prop/set: The Mother/Computer room. Round, lights.No likable or detestable characters here. All ordinary boring nothing characters.Tom Skerritt/Captain Dallas, the most boring characters here, right after Veronica Cartwright/Lambert. He is no captain Kirk. Kirk would save his ship before himself. Skerritt - ""Open the door, I don't care if we infect the whole crew and ship"". Skerritt is an OK actor. His character here and Skerritt's acting is crap. Skerritt is killed/or taken off screen.Lambert at this point loses it and comes up with this films 2nd best idea, take the shuttle and get off the ship. Since the shuttle takes only 3, and there are 4 people left, the robot not discovered yet, they decide to kill the alien.Ripley goes to the computer room/Mother and finds out that the mission is to bring the Alien specimen in at all cost, the crew is expendable. Fight ensues where Ash/Robot attacks Weaver. Parker and Lambert help Ripley and decapitate Ash. This is one of the most disgusting, milk everywhere, crap fight choreography ever. Even the props here suck! Fake head, fake robot body, fake dummy head burning. It just sucks.Ripley is now looking for the cat (Cat Search II). Parker and Lambert Get killed. Parkers death was cool. Lambert just frozen, is killed off screen. OK.More props. The self-destruct mechanism. Another User reviewer posed a question: Do all ship have self-destruct mechanisms? 10 minutes to detonation. She tries to get to the shuttle, alien blocking her path, she tries to deactivate the self-destruct. Oh, the suspense. She can't. Her and the cat are now onboard the shuttle and off just in time. Detonation time. We see 3 explosions. How is that possible? The death star only exploded once.That would have been enough to end the movie. But, after Ripley put the cat to sleep, she sees the alien, somehow squeezed into under the control panels. She puts on a space-suite, decompresses the shuttle. We hear mumbling coming from Ripley as she is trying to open the door to the shuttle to dump the alien out. Mumbling! Alien is excremented out of the shuttle, then conveniently faces the rocket and is burned out into space. Before all that we get to see Ripley strip down to her ugly underwear.This is not Sc-Fi/Horror. It is Sc-Fi, and Terror. Or just Terrible. Horror would entail supernatural like undead/Dracula.The acting dialogue looks like they improvised and are all one takes - real crap.You want to love this because the ""Alien"" looks cool and that you're a sc-fi fan and it's a ""classic"", fine. But, please do not insult the intelligence of the whole human race by claiming this is the greatest film ever, or the greatest sc-fi film ever. It's not. Not even close. Best part of the mess is the props and sets. The cinematography is minimum. Lighting is annoying. The acting/dialogue/characters sucks. I don't care if they're a bunch of space truckers, no ""company"" would allow these slobs on a spaceship. They spend about 5% of the time on story. 95% of this is props/sets. Better to watch it with the sound off and listen to Black Sabbath. Or watch something that is complete.Best part, Matte painting, when John Hurt descends to the egg chamber was cool. props.If you've never seen this before, maybe a C grade, 5 stars.If you've seen it before, no more surprises, grade D, 3 stars.I'm done with this. F, 1 star.Check out Galaxina instead. At least that's a comedy.",NA
"Alien","jgcorrea","24 October 2019","The seven passengers of the Nostromo spaceship are awakened from their long sleep by the artificial intelligence, soon discovering that the cause is an unknown signal coming from a planetoid in the region. Forced to temporarily suspend the mission in order to check what the signal was about, the crew uncovers the terrible truth behind this detour. An unseen alien, dangerous and utterly hostile, completely shifts the goal from a peaceful return mission to Earth to a struggle for survival against something whose behavior cannot be predicted, which has no known vulnerabilities and no intention to stop.This movie does not rely on cheap shock tactics, since even suggesting a great deal of violence, most deaths are not even shown.It also has a social edge. Earlier in the story, workers argued about working conditions, wages and bonuses, like Newcastle miners in ancient union meetings. They have a sense of the greed of the company they work for. They barely believe the true priority of the mission.But the point in Alien is not a social message, it's rather taking us away from our reality and transporting us to another world-not our own.Despite uncountable imitating sequels and the like , Alien has lost none of its power. One of its side purposes is to explore the inner workings of the mind and share it with the spectator. I'm sure there is nothing inherently wrong with escapist entertainment.",NA
"Alien","renegadeviking-271-528568","11 December 2019","This year was the 40-year anniversary of the 1979 movie Alien, starring Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, one of the iconic heroes of science-fiction. Being the fake-film-geek-girl I am, it was a movie I hadn't seen until just recently, despite having watched the Alien vs. Predator movies and being familiar with the story through its place in the cultural zeitgeist. Going into the movie, I knew three things: Ripley is the sole survivor, the chest buster scene would happen, and of course, what the final Xenomorph would look like. I didn't know anything.Alien is a 1979 science-fiction horror film directed by Ridley Scott and written by Dan O'Bannon. The film stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, and Yaphet Kotto.We begin with the crew of the commercial space ship Nostromo being awakened from their stasis during a return trip to Earth. Our crew of redshirts is made up of Captain Dallas, Executive Officer Kane, Warrant Officer Ripley (the hero we don't deserve), Navigator Lambert, Science Officer Ash, and two engineers, Parker and Brett (the true heroes of this story). After begin awoken, they realize that they are not actually in their own star system. That's because the ship's computer, Mother, had awoken them early because of a distress signal that they are required to investigate. Otherwise, they would have to forfeit their money.They land on the moon LV-426 and end up taking damage from the atmosphere and rocky terrain. Parker and Brett repair the ship while Dallas, Kane, and Lambert head out to investigate the signal as Ash looks on from the ship. As they journey, Ripley deciphers part of the transmission and figures out that it isn't a distress call; it's a warning.From this point on,it gets crazy. The three outside crew members explore an alien ship, and Kane ends up finding a bunch of eggs. While he's leaning over one, it opens, and a facehugger breaks through his helmet and attaches itself to his face. When the crew tries to bring Kane back aboard the Nostromo, Ripley, who is technically in command, says they can't let them in because of the need for a 24-hour quarantine. If only they had listened. Ash overrules Ripley and lets them in, and because of that, the majority of the crew is doomed to death. The facehugger implants an alien baby inside of Kane, and it explodes from his chest during dinner (rude), and the rest is man vs. monster in its purest form.Watching the film, it struck me that the only people with any sense at all are Parker (Yaphet Kotto), Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) and Ripley. All three of them are uncomfortable with the situation. Parker (along with Brett) is already frustrated they are underpaid for their work and isn't interested in sticking their necks out any more. Also, in the book, he agrees with Ripley about the quarantine. Lambert spends most of the trip outside saying that they should term back. She is instantly unnerved, but Dallas and Kane go forward. Not only is Ripley the one who decodes the message and tries to save everyone else, but she is the only one who is suspicious of Ash and paying attention.When Ripley finally takes over following the death of Dallas, and finds out that Ash has been working with the company to return the alien to Earth; the crew is expendable. That's when we find out that Ash is a robot, and I did not know that and I screamed. That was such a twist, and I had no idea that robots were a normal thing in the Alien franchise. It was so good, and his final line: ""I can't lie to you about your chances, but ... you have my sympathies""? What a dick.It makes sense that the three of them are the last ones to survive (before it becomes one), because they were the ones most going against the company line. Even Parker, who might have seemed crude at the beginning, dies because he's trying to save Lambert, rather than just taking the shot when he the chance.I'm not going to bring up Jones, because that cat would have survived them all without any help because he was by far the most capable.There is something beautifully simplistic about Alien-the practical effects, the design of the alien, and how the tension just keeps ramping up. We spend so little time with the alien onscreen, but we do feel the terror because of its ability to just maneuver easily in the vents, not to mention the inky blackness of it blends into the darkness so that you can't tell it's there until it's too late.Alien and the character of Ellen Ripley helped change science fiction for the better, and I'm so glad that I finally get the hype. All the twists work out perfectly, and I can tell that watching it again, knowing all the secrets, will only make it more interesting.",NA
