"the_headspace","9 December 2023","It might just be me, but the older I get, the less able, or willing, I am to grapple with multiple apparently unconnected characters doing apparently unconnected things. Season 1 is great. A close-knit group of people surviving a monster outbreak in a single, claustrophobic environment, where (as the title suggests) home becomes somewhere strange and terrifying. Monsterization is closely linked to human desire. Every monster is unique, and almost sympathetic. But inevitably, the filmmakers decide to expand the storyline, go bigger, move outside those constraints. The Matrix did it. Countless zombie movies and shows have done it. But it rarely seems to work. Involving the military might seem logical, but it kills the uniqueness of the premise, and turns an intense, personal drama into yet another generic post-apocalyptic mess. Monsters look the same, hunt in packs, have no personal connection to the main characters. Lots (I mean lots) of guns. And by the end of season two, I have no idea what's going on. Like I said, that might be me, but I don't think so. It's as if they're throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. Not much, I'm afraid. I really hope season 3 goes back to a smaller, more intense storyline, but I doubt it.","

"ayameofazuma","5 December 2023","I really liked season 1, but i can't even sit through season 2. It's fine to add some new characters, but this was like watching an entirely different show. There's too much military, but that's not as bad as the whole new cast of characters that I just find extremely boring. The season 1 cast is barely in it. I'm not sure if this is Netflix's fault or not, but their shows often go downhill in following seasons. They change too much for the worst. I have been fast forwarding a lot of season 2 because the dialogue is so boring I can't even focus on it. I'll probably eventually finish it just to see how it ends. But I will continue to fast forward a lot.","

"Clive_W","29 December 2020","Awesome bit of fun, if your looking for some kinda bonkers weird horror series to do with these demon-like monsters, this would be something to check out. The characters are enjoyable, fun, and silly. The story is much in the same vain, it's enjoyable, silly, fun, great horror, very reminiscent of Tokyo Gore Police. Soundtrack did make me chuckle, I wander how much ""Warriors"" by imagine dragon costed, we had a fun little bet going as to when it was going to be played. I can't wait for a second season!!!","

"andymhancock","13 January 2021","The story arc and plot are random and chaotic. Whatever seems to fit at the moment. The scene cuts were spasmodic. But it was engaging enough for me to watch to the end, even though I was debating whether to continue a few episodes in. Once I got use to the whatever-goes mentality, I could enjoy it.","

"fake_moviestar","21 December 2020","So this is definitely one of those shows that people will either love or hate. I feel like you get a pretty good idea of the tone, atmosphere, and direction right from the very first episode, so if you dislike the first episode then I would not continue watching.
Yes, the CGI isn't the best, but it's also not the worst I've seen either.
The core of this show is this group of random people in an apartment complex trying to survive a sudden monster apocalypse. It is gritty, dark, and somewhat confusing.All that being said, I really and unexpectedly loved this show. The weirdness of it intrigued me in the first episode, and by episode 3 I was fully hooked. The characters are really, really great and you can't help but root for them to survive. I loved the soundtrack, especially the use of Imagine Dragons ""Warrior."" I can't really explain why I loved this show so much, it was just this perfect combination of weird and exciting and gory that kept me completely immersed until the very last second. I really hope they give this a second season because there was a lot left unexplained!","

"HeIILu","7 December 2023","The first season was definitely worth watching. I'm trying to figure out why the 2nd season lost it all, as I fell inlove with the 1st season, but ended up finding nothing worth caring about in the 2nd.And as it turns out... The plot of this show was actually based on it's original webtoon. The 2nd season's storyline doesn't take place in the webtoon, as expected...It seems like the show was taken over by a whole different set of creators.During season 1, the monsters and their encounters were much more intense, captivating and so much more interesting. The whole setting was claustrophobic, and quite challenging in itself. It was all very suited for this imaginative horror show.... In season 2 that's what I was most disappointed about. It seemed like the monsters didn't belong in the same horrifying universe anymore, and they were no longer a major part of the story.Why shift so much focus onto constant drama between a variety of uninteresting, unlikeable, unbearable characters? It's frustrating how nobody is getting along. Everyone argues, slaps and punches each other. Never-ending bitterness, tension and moody whining through it all..? Liking someone apparently means being inlove with a person who doesn't care about your existence at all. Too many are simply heartlessly cruel, as well.What is there to love about the show, anymore? Is it just meant to get watched, not meant to be enjoyed?I'd recommend season 1, but to ignore that there's more episodes after. All we can do now is hope that season 3 might find it's way back and somehow remember how it was meant to entertain, or perhaps some of us should just go ahead and read the webtoon instead.","

"HorrorEnjoyer","27 December 2020","I was really impressed by the first few episodes, but series start to go down very quickly after that. It seemed like they've spent most of their budget on the first few episodes, because after that it's almost nothing but people sitting around, talking and crying. Lots and lots of crying. Newly introduced monster designs were crappy and sub part, in comparison to the beginning.I just hope, that if this show gets the second season, they'll get more money to bring in some new cool looking monster designs, rather than focusing on people fighting people, like they did as the season progressed.","

"hanalisss","30 November 2023","Sweet Home stands as a gripping testament to the power of the horror genre in Korean television, weaving a tale that is equal parts heart-wrenching and terrifying. With its intricate storytelling, well-developed characters, and stunning visuals, the series takes us on a rollercoaster ride of emotions while exploring the very essence of humanity in the face of monstrous adversity.Explores the complexities of human nature under extreme circumstances. The narrative unfolds as reclusive loner Cha Hyun-soo, portrayed with remarkable depth by Song Kang, finds himself thrust into a nightmarish scenario when his apartment complex turns into a breeding ground for monstrous creatures. From the outset, the series establishes a foreboding atmosphere, intensified by the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that expertly complements the unfolding horror.Huge commitment to character development. As the residents of the apartment complex grapple with their worst fears manifesting into grotesque creatures, the series meticulously explores the humanity that persists within them. Each character is meticulously crafted, revealing layers of vulnerability, resilience, and darkness. Song Kang's portrayal of Cha Hyun-soo is a revelation, as he seamlessly transitions from a tormented soul to a reluctant hero, carrying the emotional weight of the narrative on his shoulders.The monsters aren't just physical entities; they are embodiments of the characters' inner demons. The creature design is both nightmarish and imaginative, adding a unique flavor to the horror genre. The CGI and practical effects are executed with such finesse that the monsters become an integral part of the narrative, heightening the stakes and intensifying the terror.The pacing of the series is commendable, balancing moments of intense horror with poignant character interactions. It doesn't rely solely on jump scares; instead, it crafts an atmosphere of dread that lingers, making every moment fraught with tension. The series isn't afraid to delve into psychological horror, exploring the darkest corners of the human mind as characters grapple with the consequences of their choices in the face of annihilation.Sweet Home also excels in its thematic exploration of survival and the blurred lines between humanity and monstrosity. It poses thought-provoking questions about the lengths individuals are willing to go to in order to survive, and the sacrifices they make along the way. The moral ambiguity of certain characters adds layers of complexity, making it challenging for us to pass easy judgments.Visually, the series is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography captures the eerie beauty of the decaying apartment complex and the gruesome transformations of its inhabitants. The juxtaposition of moments of quiet despair with frenetic action sequences creates a dynamic viewing experience.The series doesn't shy away from addressing societal issues either. Amidst the horror, it explores themes of isolation, trauma, and the resilience of the human spirit. It reflects the anxieties of the real world through its fictional narrative, making it a socially relevant piece of storytelling.This one is a triumph in the horror genre, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in Korean television. It weaves a narrative that is as emotionally resonant as it is terrifying, with stellar performances, masterful storytelling, and a visual aesthetic that leaves a lasting impression. For those seeking a thrilling and thought-provoking exploration of the human psyche in the face of unimaginable horrors, Sweet Home is a must-watch that transcends the confines of its genre.","

"kevin_robbins","3 May 2021","Sweet Home (2020) is a Korean horror television series available on Netflix. The storyline focuses on a virus outbreak that turns people into monsters. The storyline evolves around a group of survivors inside a residential high rise building while chaos takes place outside.The writing for this is very inconsistent. The first four episodes were out of this world A+ action and horror scenes. It was so fun. I thought this show was Amazing out of the gate. However, the storyline quickly shifts from the cool monsters to the humans hybrids and their conflicting feelings about the surviving humans. Overall this series had a lot of potential and falls apart halfway through. The series was a 10/10 through 4-5 episodes and then 3/10 the last 5 so I'd give this a 5.5/10.","

"Leofwine_draca","5 February 2021","SWEET HOME is a South Korean TV show from 2020 now available for viewing on Netflix. It's based on a 'web toon', whatever that is, and I went into it with a few reservations that were quickly blown away from the end of the first instalment. This ten-episode, hour long series explores the lives of a group of residents at a tower block who wake up one day to find the world destroyed and rampaging mutated monsters killing anyone who ventures out of doors. Even worse, some of their own are infected and in the process of becoming monsters themselves!Handsomely shot and mounted, this possesses all of the quality acting you expect from Korean cinema and television, and the realistically-drawn character portraits of people you don't always like or love but who ring true to life: the conflicted, suicidal teenager; the stroppy guitarist; the masculine firefighter; the scarred gangster with a talent for torture. Interesting character development is interspersed with outlandish action and fight scenes every episode as the dwindling characters encounter one nightmarish creation after another. The CGI effects aren't meant to be photorealistic but I grew to love them anyway as they fit the show's fantastic landscape. Twisty, turning, surprising and grisly, with a consistent quality from beginning to end, this might well be the TV show of the year.","

"chiaramariecapritta","1 December 2023","I'VE WAITED THREE YEARS JUST TO SEE JISOO CHARACTER DIE IN EPISODE THREE?!? SHE HAS LITERALLY 5 MINUTES OF SCREEN AND SAYS 3 LINE ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!I'm so angry to whoever did her character this wrong.Webtoon's fans didn't deserve this, Jisoo's fans didn't deserves this.Also they killed Ji-soo in episode three and five minutes later already introduce another female character. Eun-yoo basically replaced ji-soo as the female protagonist, while in the first season she was just a child now she's magically become this strong woman. NO. I WON'T ACCEPT THIS. I AM BEYOND ANGRY AT THE PRODUCERS AND THE WRITERS BEHIND THIS. The actress didn't have time to shoot? You put a scene where you give hope to people and maybe try to shoot more for season 3 AND GIVE HER CHARACTER THE ATTENTION SHE DESERVE.Honestly I don't even care what happens next, they had more money but some monsters are still awfully made, the intro sucks compared to the first one and the main themes were better in the first season, nothing can compare to WARRIORS by imagine dragons.I'm sorry but season one remains the best. This one is just too badly written.","

"themadcamel","19 December 2020","With some pretty terrifying cosmetics and fairly basic CGI, it does create some disturbing scenes akin to Evil Dead. But the plot is sadly ruined by a lot of nonsensical moments actions & reactions that are clearly only there to create tension. It's also oddly like every actor went to the same acting school and acquired an annoying prolonged lifeless gaze look as their reaction to basically everything.... Wondering what to have for dinner? ( Stare longingly into the fridge). Watching your neighbour get devoured by a hideous demon (stare longingly into neighbours intestines). Saving your friends from certain death by simply closing a door ( stare longingly at door handle) it's relentlessly like this from start to finish.","

"scottmannen1","26 January 2021","Season 1 was great, a novel and entertaining season. Season 2 however has a lot of what made S1 great now is missing.One of the biggest problems I have with the show is the protagonist. He turns half monster for the entire season, but other than the healing ability he is completely and I mean COMPLETELY useless compared to other monsters. The first problem is that he will not fight. He will stand there and take punches, hits, stabs cuts and wont lift a finger to fight back because he doesnt want to hurt people. Talk about ridiculous. On top of that they tried to give him some monster ""wings"" so that he can fly around with these monster wings on his back, but guess what""? They literally only gave him ONE wing on his back. You dont have to be an aerospace engineer to know that one big wing on only one side of your back wont work and shouldnt fly, but of course it somehow works. It looks ridiculous though. I am sure they thought it was going to look cooler than it did. All of those things really annoyed me about this season but what really got on my nerves the most was him crying. He is crying in every single episode he is in. Multiple times, and he cries and cries and cries. This is an adult man who is supposed to be a monster but instead cries like a baby all the time. They destroyed this character and had the chance to make a character that was cool powerful an strong yet we got this mess. What a disaster!!The entire second season is lackluster also in comparison to the first. The story is all over the place in S2 and bounces around a bit too much.Other than all that negative stuiff, the show IS still entertaining. Some of the monsters are interesting but the CGI this season was much worse than the first season. This season we got monsters that look like transformers made of garbage (they show up in a few episodes). They make the monsters move intentionally very fast so that the camera doesnt zoom in on how poor the cgi truly is this season. The is entertainment value to this show still!! Its not a terrible show, its just not great, I give it a 6/10 for season two and an 7.5/10 for season one.","

"infernoguyrules","6 December 2023","The first season was pretty cool, it wasn't my favorite show by any means and i thought it had a lot of problems as far as just kinda odd cartoonish character moments, but thats the thing is some of its best moments could have been described that way too, but when that applied to the drama rather than the action and horror, it took me out of certain moments, where things just seemed a bit childish and melodramatic. Darkness for its own sake. Still, i thought it had a unique world and i like the weird noticeable CG monsters that don't try to hard to look perfectly real, i find them more visually interesting than monsters in plenty of other series or movies i'd consider better overall. So season 1 got a 6 from me, and im a rather harsh reviewer. Season 2 however, went down the drain VERY quickly. I can't even describe how much happened in this season that i didn't care about. I made it through 3-4 episodes because there were some interesting monsters that held my interest and a few interesting moments with main characters. Around there i realized there was suddenly just a LOT going on that i did not care about at all, and i just felt i had to skip some scenes to get through, it was all these military guys just being dicks to eachother, very boring. I basically fast forwarded through the last half and the end seemed frankly stupid to me. Other reviews i checked out agreed that this was mostly just chaotic pointless filler, its wild to me they filmed a whole other season already as well, because this is BAD. Skip this one.","

"TreeFiddy53","23 December 2020","The trailer had me hooked, and I was looking forward to this. The show is visually great, IMO. There's a decent amount of CGI that's hit/miss but various practical visual effects were done really well. The show is very colorful for almost 10 episodes of scenes trapped inside a building. The music was good too, minus the repetitive Imagine Dragons song. So if you like to enjoy stuff like that, give this a shot.
One of things that's a plus about Korean movies and shows in general is that they easily blend genres. They make you get so invested into the characters in thrillers/horrors that the genre also becomes emotional - in a good way. Sweet Home has A LOT of characters but it takes time to get invested. But since it's a tv show and since there were so many people, i think it's okay to consume that much time.
The monsters too, are very different from each other, unlike what we'd have seen in most zombie-type movies, they too had different personalities.
The story though, was a slight let-down for me, I personally found that there were inconsistencies which breaks the suspense/tension/sense of urgency. I felt that there were several questions that were left unanswered towards the end of the show, which was also a let down, but maybe that's just me. Will there be an S2? Will they answer all those questions? I don't know, and the show doesn't end in a way that would make me wait in anticipation for S2 and for those answers. I might not even watch it, answers or not.
But overall, something slightly different to watch. I thought that it was visually really good, great music/sound too! Watch this if you're bored and have nothing else to watch. 10 hours is a lot of commitment.","

"ekinagacik","20 December 2020","People who gave 1 point should finish the show. Honestly, at first I did not understand the subject because I haven't read the webtoon. I continued watching and the show really amazed me. It made me think about every single person's unknown inner world. One episode I hated one character and I was like die right now you are so annoying. In the other I cried for that character and prayed for him/her not to die. I loved watching them become a family. Character developments, understanding all of the characters' inner worlds step by step was amazing. In the beginning there was scenes about past and they are confusing I agree but you'll see that they are puzzle pieces and in the end they would complete the puzzle.","

There is too much military involved, it's just another action show, with no interesting plot, boring dialogues and characters.

"Otte1","31 December 2020","The story is addicting enough to make you want to know what happens at the end. There are some attempts at character development to provide some reasoning for the motivations. It is Return of the Living Dead, X-Men and the Mist.
There are many comments about the horrible CGI and it is true. The CGI was almost at a level of a talented teenager with a laptop and Adobe. Since the series has certain level of dark comedy, I was able to look past that. I was not able to look past that this 10-hour series could have very easily been a very good 2.5 hour movie. There was extremely amount of filler that did not provide any additional context to the move.Other big problem was editing which is the reasoning for my 4 stars. It is disjointed to say the least. It is almost like they taped entire scenes and then cut out the bloopers or mistakes and stitched together what was left with reshooting anything. There are many jumps, skips and entire characters appearing and not appearing and darkness that makes it hard to know what is going on(think Game of Thrones White Walker battle in Season 8). A five second action scene can have 15+ edits and you end up confused. Other big issue....the ending, I have no idea what happened in the last 15 minutes.For some people this may be a 7 or 8 star while for most 'adults' it will be 6 at best.","

"Mehki_Girl","20 December 2020","Enjoyable, but somewhat odd. The creatures are great, not always realistic looking. That's not what's odd. What's odd is overly long shots of people just looking or staring with no expression on their faces.Maybe it's a cultural thing but no one really seems to react to anything with fear, even curiosity. Things just happen in front of them and they just stand there staring at it. A 10-ft tall thing with elongated legs and arms and everyone just stands there going, what is that? And then as it approaches them, nobody moves they just stand there. Its it's bizarre.A lot of characters are introduced, but you start to be able to distinguish who's who and what they're doing and who's brave, who's a coward, who probably needs to be killed by the monsters, and who you're going to enjoy being killed by the one of the monsters.Another strange aspect to this series is Marlboro Man. the dude in the suits what's up with him is he infected, is he not infected, or did he just happen to be caught up in this when he was robbing somebody???I'm three episodes in and I can't tell yet. Stuck in the house during the pandemic you could do worse.","

"phd_travel","21 December 2020","The story rushes into assorted monster attacks too quickly without establishing an emotional connection with the characters or background story. Not scary or exciting if you don't care for the characters. Unusual for a Korean series to lack an emotional connection. This series has a one dimensional story with less depth than usual. Only later in flashbacks do you get to know the characters but it's too late by then. The viewer is plunged into a post apocalyptic gory mess quite quickly without enough explanation and the attacks feel repetitive and monotonous. And the gratuitous violence is out of place in a Korean series.
Visually the monsters and effects look good. The cast is good and likeable with 18 Again's Lee Do Hyun, Love Alarm's Song Kang, Lee Jin Wook surprisingly good as a tough guy and Park Kyu Yung of It's Okay.
I prefer Kingdom or the excellent Odd Family Zombie for Sale to Sweet Home.","

"mg_legend","3 December 2023","Hard to really describe the show. Its definitely fun and entertaining. The CGI tends to be a bit crappy, if the monsters were more ""consistent"" their CGI being low quality would be more forgivable.Main flaw with the monsters ""consistency"" is just how conveniently you don't see any, at all, for the longest time it fits for the so-so storyline at the time. In S2, they're just so uncommon, no country on earth would struggle to finish them off. S2 the monsters would struggle to compete with any small redneck US street nevermind trained Korean military.On the other hand some of the ""monsters"" they create but probably don't use brilliantly have so much potential.It gets so many things right but also fails drastically at other times. All said, even at its worst I'd still definitely recommend giving it a chance.","

They tried to cram in the whole story along with heavy changes into 10 episodes. The problem with this is:Everyones character arc is watered down along with Cha Hyun-Su.The epic finale from the comics is reworked into some kind of military crap which is the default of every pandemic movie.The dark tone of the comic is reworked into the lines of an action movie rather than horror. Everytime something happens they spam Warriors by Imagine Dragons.Also whats up with the wierd camera cuts/jumps that happens all the time. It's like they skip 5 seconds forward during action scenes and you lose track of what's going on.","

Season 1 seemed to be taking you in one direction and Season 2 seems to have no direction at all. Most of the new characters are grating and unwatchable. Much of the acting is poorly done. And as is usual with Netflix, the dubbing is really bad. I don't know why Netflix keeps choosing the same voice actors, because they are awful and they make it really difficult to watch foreign films. Watch it in the original language and read subtitles. The concept is interesting. It could've been really good but execution is not great.","

Season one was a blast, lots of action kept you glued to the screen the actors and actresses in the series were fighting for their survival and towards the end they were rescued and you thought that this would get even better. Season 2 went completely sideways. Nothing really related to season 1 mostly soldiers and people I haven't seen in season 1 and very few things that kept me interested. I had a hard time watching the 8 episodes of season 2 as it was really that bad. Season 1 on the other hand I was able to binge watch it in 2 days. Supposedly there is to be a season 3 or a continuation of season 2 I really don't know. I hope that this gets better as Netflix took a promising series and pretty much flushed it down the toilet with season 2.","

"PennyReviews","3 October 2021","Korean Drama 'Sweet Home' has awful CGI, but it makes up with the on-point atmosphere. The settings, the costumes, the music, the performances, everything is and feels perfect, as the group of residence is trying to survive. However, this season felt more like the introduction, as we start to get to know each character and bond with them, without, nevertheless, getting too deep into the mystery of what is happening and why and how to move forward. Still, this season sets strong foundations for those to come.In addition, everything is well constructed, with enough screen time for each character and each storyline. The pace is also perfect for the action element of the story. Finally, the performances were all quite emotional.So, overall, 7 out of 10.","

"biba_yu","27 March 2021","As a Webtoon long time fan, I just had to watch this, and I can say, I am not disappointed. Characters are just amazing, great representation of human interaction in specific horrifying circumstances, lovely depiction of fight from average, normal people you could likely meet anywhere, great action, fun, there is also a lot of humor, and the story is just amazing. It has horror, sf and comedy elements, but it also has deeper meaning, much more than surface deep horror, it makes you think. There is no some superficial glamour, no model like characters, but humans you can relate to and like. Story is quite interesting and has deeper layers than it looks on first sight. Granted, CGI effects are not much, as production does not seem expensive, but I still loved it, because all CGI is in function of the story, not just to shock you.Also, soundtrack is getting great along with the story.I would recommend it, and I am waiting for second season!Update: don't watch the second season, it just ruins the first one. First one is 10, second is like 3. Not good. Could be completely different series like spin-off, but then I wouldn't watch it.","

Sometimes I felt I skipped some scenes because you don't feel the connections between previous scenes and present scenes. They are like showing so many scenes at a time without any reason and explaination. They will show you the reason after two episode that's too late. I don't understand one thing why some people came and attack them and kill them no reason nothing that was stupid. I don't understand the monologue of the characters also. And yes CGI is bad!All actors are good. They did fabulous jobI.","

"gabriel_sanchez","21 March 2021","If you are a fan of post-apocalyptic themes, monsters, and gore, then this series probably got your attention. It got mine.Seuwiteuhom (2020) is heavy on gore, suspense, and drama. The gore is self-explanatory. The other two need in-depth details.The suspense is what kept me going. Not only because of the thrilling moments but also the curiosity to know what will happen next. Every episode does a great job of raising a question, a concern, and leaving answers for later. This kept my attention and gave me the motivation to keep watching until the end.Finally, the drama. This series is great about portraying the drama involved in this whole situation. And the character acting is outstanding. You care for people, you hate some people, you cheer for the heroes. In the end, I think this is all about humans, even though the main problem is the monsters.As for the monsters, I have to mention the cheap CGI. It definitely breaks your immersion. You need to numb your mind to this and watch it for the plot. In contrast, the practical effects are well done.I would definitely recommend it to everyone, but I know this is not for everyone. Casual watchers will not like this series. Gore and monster lovers will like it, maybe.","

"Pairic","18 May 2021","Sweet Home: South-Korean TV series, mostly set in an apartment block. There is a conspiracy at work here, some state actors new things were wrong before the outbreak. People transform into different types of monsters, zombies, giant spiders, gel creatures, shape-shifters. A motley crew try to survive in the block, infighting, suspicion are rife but people also co-operate. Dark in more ways than one with the tower block interiors. Some of the back stories are a bit soapish but others contain elements of existential terror. Some great fight scenes with the mnsters but there are also tangles with marauders and soldiers. Great fun. Multipe directors and writers based on the Naver webtoon of the same name by Kim Kan-bi and Hwang Young-chan. On Netflix. 8/10.","

"A_winters_wolf","20 December 2020","Updated review after finishing watching season 1. I thought it was one of the saddest yet beautiful shows I've ever watched, there was a lot of tear jerking moments for me and I'm not someone who gets emotional often. The story is basically people are turning into random monsters and follow a group of survivors in an apartment building. I would say it falls under horror but there is some light humour thrown in as well. There is good deal of drama in the mix, a couple of times I did actually cry something I don't do often. It is very well acted the story is great so far and there is a good balance of action and character building. I recommend watching with the original Korean voice with English subtitles, I tried to watch it with English voice overs but it just wasn't as good. The one negative i have is on the most part the effects are good but the CGI is great in places and then terrible in others. But I can't recommend this enough, now that being said season 2 just seems to be lacking something, I'm assuming it written by a different team because it just isn't as good it seems to swing more towards intense action with monster in it. They kill off characters we came to enjoy in the first season because you know why not? It's still some what enjoyable however I just feel the writing has let it down hopefully it will pick up in season 3.","

"ankurkini-450-655463","21 December 2023","6 stars I am giving only for season 1 which had its unique charm about it and not being like all the other zombie shows out there. Although having limited characters, each had their own back story and were given a chance to develop in their own way throughout the season. Every monster was great and different (coming from they're own personal desire). So all this was good about season 1
season 2: remaining characters from season 1 are transported to this stadium for some time where there are 400 more people and it is really hard to catch up with everybody's motives. In the process of focusing on these other characters, plus the ""Crow"" army people (they're good guys fighting the monsters), the main characters are either killed off or given very less screen time. Believe me when I say this, but even the main guy (who's face is on the poster and who is supposed to be a ray of hope in this dark time) has less screen time. Monsters became mediocre and less scary, most with a generic zombie look. The cute kid became a bully, the nerd guy became a gambling moron, a prominent girl from s1 is killed off early into the season, the ballet girl is lost in her own mission to find her brother. I don't even remember what happened to the others but this season wasn't memorable at all
all in all, I think s3 will probably get cancelled if this is how s2 went. A lot of fans are upset as I am.","

"onelovek","21 December 2020","Read and listen.... I can understand people who freaked out in the first 3 episodes, bad cg, cut scenes, blah blah. After the first 3 episodes it gets better. It's different and fresh. It gets better and better when all the characters develop. I understand it, I get it. Bypass the mediocre graphics and understand the overall tv show. It's brilliant, it's different. I do like all the characters, and I love the acting, they have some of my favorite supporting characters in other Korean shows. It develops and it changes. It's not your typically survive from monsters tv show, it brings a different element to it. I really hope it has a second season and this is higher than a 7.5 in my opinion. I think it has potential to 7.8-8.3 overall. Each character have their own story and there is more story to come. I wish people would leave reviews after watching a few episodes instead of jumping to conclusion. I agree, I did not like it at first and I thought about it like a dark comedy but it develop into something serious, especially when you like all the characters. People, please, chill out and give it a try. Support new ideas instead of bashing on it with weak reviews. I think it's a 8.3 but I'll rate it a 10 to help with the ratings because it will turn away people, it's not bad of a tv show as how some people made it to be. I already binged 9 episodes in 2 days. Good stuff, chill out please.","

Nothing interesting happens. Nothing cool happens. For some reason the monsters now look like transformers.I just really can't believe how BAD this show has gotten in just 1 season.

Overall, they did a fantastic job of capturing the essence of the webtoon.I loved seeing the characters and monsters come to life in this drama.

They didnt even potray properly why main character fight the desire to prevent him from turning monster. He actually want to go to to his fav concert according to comic. And also he will talk to mosterous design of himself too many times not only one or two. Also in the series i didnt get sweet home atmosphere. In comic, main character will despise his own family and won't even shed a tear wen they dead but at the end he will giv in to his desire to protect all people that was with him and also in the imagination world he wil return to his dead family side happily. Tats y its sweet home. Also because the music title. Then only he wil turn into monster. They didnt even insert the scene where the monsters will turn into human sized egg and born again with no memory. So many flaws. Anyway the comic is my fav. It gave me goosebumps and also heart ache at the same time","

Definitely not. But it was interesting. The acting and characters weren't bad, although there were very cliché. If they had some money, I hope they'd change the cgi and music. The music choices were awful. They play irrelevant music on an irrelevant scenes. In general, I said it was not bad as a Korean series. I'll probably watch the next seasons as well. The monster selections were also good, albeit cliché. Also, the title name of the series is not a good choice.","

"sharoncsalerni-69765","3 October 2022","I can't believe how much I enjoyed this show! At first glance you think ""Okay so this is kind of a cool idea"" then you start watching and monsters show up and you realize that it's really not what you thought it was going to be but kinda is in a good way..!?! LOL
What I mean is that it manages to keep you entertained even after the first couple monster scenes when you realize how ""Low Budget"" everything looks and you think that you are not going to want to keep watching but then the story starts and you realize you actually like these characters and the story is just ""un-corny"" enough that you actually want to figure out what is going on and almost get a little invested in certain characters.Don't get me wrong...there are some huge and confusing things that happen but you end up not really caring however if you were to watch it a 2nd or 3rd time you'd probably want to know what the heck just happened but yeah not too shabby.I went with the 8 stars because like most of the Netflix series I've seen that have subtitles and are dubbed the words don't match with what the actors are saying so you don't know which to follow. (I noticed that the words seemed a bit more detailed/correct than the subtitles but could be wrong.)As much as I like the main characters I'd be interested in learning more about the rest of the cast but hopefully that will happen next season! I still have a couple episodes left but I'm interested in seeing what happens and how he ends up where he is in the opening scenes.EDITED TO ADD:
Changed my 8 to a 10 after watching the last couple episodes! Everything that happened towards the end was crazy! They left it at the most perfect point! Couldn't be a better cliffhanger!","

I binged on it for a few nights.What was even more refreshing is the Korean cast... it was so nice to take a break from American ""culture"" and actually see good people, just plain simple, good, nice, all likeable people without typical annoying American ""baggage"". Nobody in this show was annoying. It was like taking a breath of clean mountain air.Very original, great atmosphere, great characters, great cinematography, great pace, great action, dialogue, I have nothing to complain about at all... it was much more enjoyable than anything Hollywood made in recent years.I will definitely be looking for more Korean movies/TV shows now.","

It's concepts are great, and in the same breath, the writing is terrible in a way that is really entertaining to tease poking fun. The effects are awesome while the characters are hilariously aching anime/manga clichés. Great emotion with wafer-thin development, and so on and so forth. I would recommend you check it out, but go in with an attitude that this isn't one of those Netflix masterpiece offerings or absolute trash despite how much people want it to be one or the other.","

"nodlimax","29 December 2020","The ideas and premise shown in Sweet Home aren't new. You have people turn into monsters and basically causing the end of the world as we knew it. I like the idea of how the humans are turning and being affected in different ways by this I guess you may call it possession.Unfortunately the execution makes it all feel completely fake. It's not just the CGI that makes it look fake. It's also how the transformation happens, how people act and even the changes themselves.Just to give a quick example on why this feels fake. Even though it isn't said when exactly it's happening towards the end of the first season we can see it starting to snow. So it plays around late autumn and early winter. This means usually it's rather cold outside. Except for one comment made by a kid no one ever refers to it being cold outside or how winter and snow may affect them. Winter in an apocalyptical event is usually a pretty serious issue. Here it's not even considered.In general food and water seem to be just some minor inconvenience that are also only mentioned once and then never again.The show is focused on human interaction and drama and unfortunately fails there too as the characters aren't feeling real for the most part and I'd call them one-dimensional.Towards the end of season one they also go for a very big cliché which is often found in zombie movies and honestly it's just not believable. In addition early on the monsters are established as a considerable threat. However the show shifts the focus away from the threat of the monsters and suddenly they barely make any appearances and are only a nuisance instead of an actual threat. You got to have your human drama...One more thing that really bothered me, was that throughout the whole season we stay in that one big apartment building. I still know nothing about how that building is even structured. We're jumping around between places within the building and often (especially in later episodes) it's not clear where the characters actually are within the building. And btw. with all the destruction going on there apparently was no real issue with getting electricity and that especially is not really believable.Honestly I wanted to like the show and I watched through season one within one week. Throughout it my rating was constantly going up and down between 3/10 and 7/10 because it has a few good scenes. Unfortunately looking at the overall result and also considering the poor choice and placement of the soundtrack at times I can't rate it higher.","

The group supper gives her the strength to stand up to him.Cha Jin-ok (Kim Hee-jung) continued attempts to open the door and escape in order to locate and save her teen daughter repeatedly puts the group in jeopardy.Kim Su-yeongm ((HeoYool) is a small child (9 Years Old) who along with her brother Kim Yeong-su (Choi Go; 6-year-old) lost their father when he was attacked by a monster while attempting to repel down the side of the building to get them food.Son Hye-in (Kim Gook-hee) considers her Pomerania; Bom, like her child and continually carries it.Im Myung-sook (Lee Bong-ryun) devastated since losing her child when the baby's stroller got loose and rolled into traffic.Choi Yoon-jae (Go Geon-Han) pretends to be kind to hide among the group from Sang-wook. But he is a human monster of another sort, a Child Predator.If Movies in the horror genre are your thing then this will likely fit the bill. The monsters were definitely scary and horrific and the fact that the people turn into monsters was in and of itself frightening . That type of transformation was reminiscent of the American movie ""The Thing"" though only vaguely so. It was interesting the way the people both had to work together while not completely trusting each other to be able to make it through. I liked that there was that central character, the teenage boy, and that he was unique and that he had the monster in him yet was largely able to control it. The series was well paced throughout most of it until towards the end when it got a little chaotic and felt like a lot of people were dying very rapidly. There were also aspects that were not well explained such as why the fire fighter character was suddenly with the military at the very end. The fact that she was working with them had been revealed earlier but it did not seem like she had given them what they wanted enough that she would've been able to join them completely. The gangster guy was very different in the television series than in the webtoon where he was more of a goofy character and much more likable. For the most part they stuck to the webtoon enough that it was clear that it was made based on it and yet deviated enough to make it work in the television format. They left it open for more seasons as everything was not wrapped up and in the fact there is additional story line in the webtoon indicates that there is story left for more episodes to the series or another season. I'm not sure why they decided to only do 10 episodes, 16 or more episodes would have allowed for a more complete telling of the story.","

And of course, the main character just takes it.And that's just it, the entire thing relies too heavily on the characters, but most of them are forgettable trash, and nothing too interesting happens to get you invested.It's all confusing too, I had to search online for explanations as to what happened exactly, since even after watching the final episode I was confused.So yeah, surprisingly disappointing.","

"kmoon79","2 May 2023","The good: I loved this show and I'm glad there's gonna be seasons 2 + 3! I love dystopia/apocalypse type shows/movies so this is right up my alley. The scary part is that there is nothing external that contaminates you (as far as we know) - everyone has the potential to become a monster, very fitting to reality. We can all choose to be good or bad. Some people could fight the monster and some could not. It's a ""monster"" show but really it's about humans and how they fight their inner demons (or not). The Imagine Dragons song (Warriors) fits right in (so would Demons btw). Eun Hyeok takes charge right away while the adults just cower and stare. (I mean, in real life, it's common for us to freeze in a dangerous situation, but sheesh, do something!) The women were the strongest characters - the two teenage girls, the firefighter, even ajumma finally killing her abusive husband. The ambiguous good/bad guy conundrum with San Wook and the child molester. And the end when Hyun Su gets in the truck and only realizes it's a trap when it's too late. Nice cliffhanger for the next season, although it was frustrating to see that guy finally ""die""... and then shapeshift. Seeing Hyun Su finally let the monster out was cool! Although I don't know how his whatever it is fits his inner demon - he was contemplating living or killing himself, and then he turns into an angel? A demon? With only one (metallic and hot) wing? I liked the fact that monsters turned on each other. Hyun Su having to deal with his monster while trying to decide where his loyalty lies - with humans (who helped him) or with monsters (who would def kill him). He picked the monsters, and I hope he changes his mind in coming seasons. The scenes where his demon appeared with black eyes and that big smile were super creepy! The christian guy with a katana was badass but why did he have to die? I get it - he died a hero (I still hate it). But that whole fight sequence was really good despite the terrible consequence.The bad: Starts off strong then quickly loses steam. A lot of suspense with monsters that just come out of nowhere but after Giant Protein Man gets destroyed (awesome sequence btw) it's like the monsters just *poof* disappear. Several people get the nosebleeds... and then nothing. Cliché army + cliché gang were boring. The surviving adults finally fight back in the last 2/3 episodes. A lot of things go unexplained: Where are the rest of the people that live in that huge building? Why was there dirt in the basement? When did Bom the Pom disappear? Also -- Eun Hyok never showed any signs of ""infection"" yet in the last episode he stays behind and only then gets a nosebleed. I think he should have survived, as he would be strong enough to fight the infection. Characters took too long to develop, if at all; mostly the adults were just 2 dimensional, except for the badass amputee guy and the old man. People took on the form of their ""inner demon"" -- Protein Man was certainly a whey-obsessed exercise freak LOL But how did he get gigantic later? What was the green slimy thing that saved the little boy? Why would someone turn into a spider? Did the mom with the imaginary baby from the first episodes turn into the creepy giant womb? The other monsters were so boring that I can't even remember them.The awful: The CGI was awful terrible and horrible! The worst I've seen in a long time, especially for a show made in 2020. I've seen worse shows with way better SFX (Hellbound, for example). Some monsters were laughably bad. Protein man was the only good cgi. A lot of action sequences were too fast and/or disjointed to make sense.Conclusion: definitely for big fans of monster/apocalypse shows. Had me on the edge of my seat the whole time! Despite the bland characters (adults) I was still rooting for each one to survive as the show progressed and I was sad when they didn't. Can't wait for season 2 that is scheduled to drop later this year!","

"gisellewn","15 December 2023","As a sweet home fan since literally the start of season 1 i was so disappointed watching season 2, the plot completely went off the rails after episode 3 and so many main characters from season 1 were killed off like they were nothing. First of all the dude from season 1 that turned into a monster on the bus in season 2 that killed the girl, that was honestly the start of the downfall as they gave character to season 1 and were killed off in season 2 like they were nothing. And don't get me started on Ji-su who was unrightfully killed in episode 3, not even to a monster but some rocks, she was one of the best characters too and practically made ""sweet home"" but died like a side character. Also, the plot was basically just filled with new irrelevant characters and overruled by the military. They also gave the MAIN character hyun-soo, who is literally on their poster, less screen time than some of the military men. And the season 2 monsters cannot even compare to the a season 1 monsters, the s2 monsters were shown with practically zombie characteristics whereas in season 1, basically every of the monsters had a storyline as to how they became a monster and what their desire was. Talking about ji-soo again (can you see my frustration) she and the other OG characters who carried the whole of season 1 were killed so fast when they developed so much depth into season 1. And to finish off my rant, the plot was horrible i'm sorry but half of the time i didn't even know what was going on because all that it was, was talking about military and that's about all i got from it, at one point i thought i was watching a war movie. Unless they bring back ji-soo somehow because of the fact that her body was never really shown, i don't see how sweet home season 3 can pull through and impress me like season 1 did. Bring Ji-Soo back.","

"denuwan-27382","20 December 2020","Sweet Home South Korean Fantasy Horror Drama Directed by one of the best kdrama directors in history Lee Eung Bok person who directed Mr.Sunshine, Goblin, and Descendants of the sun. This is a popular webtoon adaptation by Netflix. First do not compare with Kingdom series. This show is the most expensive Netflix show made in South Korea so I had high expectations but after watching the trailer I was kinda disappointed. CGI monsters look likes garbage to me, yes in this series they look like PlayStation 2 game. That's the biggest weakens in this series. When it comes to practical effects they have done a great job. Sweet Home reminds me of Resident Evil and Train to Busan. The plot is good but there are few plot holes. This is not just another zombie drama because these monsters are not easy to kill and every each monster is very unique that's one of the main reasons for me to keep watch this series. I loved the cinematography and color grading. There are a lot of close-up shots. It reminds me of the dexter intro which is really awesome. This is the most aggressive kdrama I have ever watched, there is a lot of violence and blood. They have a top-notch cast for this series and there not going to disappoint you. Every character in this series felt real to me. there are a lot of character developments throughout the series. There were a few characters that I need a backstory for them. The soundtracks are good but there was imagine dragons song and I felt that is not necessary for the scenes. Overall this is a good show with a lot of entertainment and I hope they develop their CGI in the next seasons.","

"jlmajor-02789","13 December 2023","I absolutely adored the first season, I've watched it many times. I've waited years and was so excited for season 2. Before season 2, I would have rated this show a 9/10. So what the heck happened? It felt like a completely different show. The style, the pacing, the direction, the acting, everything felt different. There was far too little of the original cast, and none of the new cast were interesting. There was no direction, it was all over the place, I didn't form a bond with any characters or locations. It felt like the show completely lost its heart and soul.The first 3 episodes are nothing but a military brutality fest with no point other than to illustrate people are worse than the Monsters could ever be. I liked it better from ep 5 on, but it was still just a slog and I was glad to be done.I've never been so disappointed with a second season. Oh well, I'll always have the first.","

"mochteam","3 October 2021","The idea of this series is great. Instead of zombies you get people turning into these crazy monsters. First seven episodes are survival horror and the last 3 are straight up Game of Thrones/Walking Dead if you know what I mean. It just gets dark, gruesome and sad really quick.What I liked the most about this series is that it isn't the usual stuff. It's like a mix of 21 days later, meets resident evil, meets the last of us meets Marvel comics. It has a lot of good themes going for it that makes it worth watching if any of the above appeal to you.I will say that watching this it seemed like a single season was good enough. I'm not sure how adding a season 2 would go with so many good characters now gone. At least for me everybody I liked was dead at the end so there was no point to watching the story further. I guess it really did hit a walking dead point.","

One of them looked exactly like a Halloween mask bought at the dollar store.The show also focuses on wayyyy too many characters, to point where you're confused on the importance of their role. Back and forth between characters, constantly. A lot of scenes had no importance nor did they add any complexity to the storyline. The timeline of the scenes also make no sense, leaving you frustrated. Overall a super messy show.Watch this only if you're under lockdown and have binged everything else on Netflix.","

The portrayal of the main character is awful. In the show he is more like a side character, he doesn't have any personality, development or a connection with any other character, they completely changed him.2. They introduce characters that didn't existed before (they had more screen time than the main character) and removed characters that were essential for the story on the web comic.3. The story is so rushed that it doesn't have any impact when a character dies.4. The story is so different to the original one, i felt like I was watching the walking dead.5. There are a lot of annoying characters that don't add anything to the plot (they're just there).6. Jisu is a very important character on the webtoon (she is one of the main ones) but here she is not (just like hyun), I was very disappointed by this.7. Also the music doesn't fit the atmosphere of some of the scenes. I remember that in a scene with Hyun that's supposed to be scary or intense they put a rap, like... what? (It was a nice song but still).In conclusion I don't recommend to watch this if you are a fan of the webtoon.","

Could definitely do with some more concrete details. A lot of the time it seemed like people just throw up their hands and go 'well, I guess I'm a monster now'.7/10 Stars, some epic moments and really good special effects, but story meanders too much.","

"astrukai","20 December 2020","I read the webcomic as it came out, and have loved it a lot. When I heard that it was getting a Netflix adaptation, I was skeptical, but excited to see what they decide to do with it. If you're like me, you'll know that they changed a lot of things, drastically. The first complaint I have is how little we get to see Hyun. I feel like the comic focused on him a whole lot more, and we also got to see his 'monster' way more frequently. The adaptation should've more on him than the rest of the group. On the other hand, I can see that if they focus on the group more, then it would strengthen the fact that Hyun is a loner, but I don't exactly like that. The ending drastically changed, and I think it's a hit or miss for most people. They added in the military and so many more things, but I liked the simplicity of the comic. Also, the girl with the character development (the one who fell to her death at the end) isn't here, and it seems like she was replaced with another guy. Old man didn't get crushed by protein monster (that was huge in the comic, I'm surprised they didn't include that) and I think the romance is kinda bad. The woman and her dead child made me cry though, so I liked how they wrote her. Overall, I'm uncertain where they'll take this, but I'll keep my hopes up for now.","

"Filmiarvustus","29 March 2021","""Sweet Home"" is a South Korean fantasy horror directed by masterful Lee Eung Bok. This show is about a group of random people in an apartment complex trying to survive a sudden monster apocalypse. It is gritty, dark, and somewhat confusing, so this is definitely a love-it-or-hate-it category. Monsters are unique and extremely hard to kill with some pretty terrifying cosmetics and fairly basic CGI. The series overall is visually stunning with many disturbing scenes akin to the Evil Dead franchise. The narrative is very disjointed, difficult to follow, and not very engaging, but the show is addictive and a bloody feast to watch.","

You just need a manga lens to get used to the silliness of some of the monsters, but as the show progresses we get less of that and more of human interactions.Still, a potential viewer must be warned that there's no explanation why that plague has befallen Seoul (and probably the world), there's no clear ending and probably no season 2.

I watched the first episode because I got bored and love these types of shows, then found myself 5 episodes in and really liking it. I would rate the first half of this show a high 8/10 even with some sketchy CGI and over acting. The second half starts to go down hill and gets very long winded with far less monsters and gore and more long, drawn out drama. By the end, it's more drama than anything. So I would rate the second half more of a 5 or 6/10. The premise is that people are turning into all sorts of monsters....no monster ever the same and at first there is no known cause for it. This show follows the survivors and monsters stuck in a very large apartment building. As the show moves on, you realize it's not an infectious disease like with zombies, but I won't say more. The CGI is sometimes great, then goes totally flat and looks absolutely horrible. Overall, this is a very enjoyable show to watch with a very unique premise behind it. I look forward to season 2 should they make one.","

Sometimes they don't make the continuation of movies and series at all. Sometimes they make with a lot of delay. I hate and am dissatisfied with the production of content that does not have a clear end. Netflix and the like make fun of the viewers and waste their time and money. Korean movie networks are doing better. Although Netflix and similar companies have more experience and facilities, they make almost all movies and series with an uncertain and ambiguous ending. They keep the viewers in an excruciating wait with uncertain timing. Now it is not clear if the continuation of this series will be made or when it will be made.

The main show however is slow as dirt, every episode is the same. You can actually skip several episodes and not miss out on the overall plot. (Episode 5-7 are just fillers)
The first episode was interesting and had potential, but then it's just the same story line over and over again. Monsters appear when the plot demands it and humans squabble over useless things. Like a monster that is 3 metre tall and weighs 200 kilo somehow appears INSIDE the building, despite being shown outside in the first episode, and somehow got in without making a single sound despite him having to break down walls in order to move his huge body around the corridors.
In the end you just find yourself waiting for the show to end, you don't care about the characters at all.This show is unfortunately a huge waste of time. There are many good Korean shows, but this is not one of them.","

I thought it would be better than S1 but it wasn't on my expectation. Like the characters from season 1 kept dying just to show new characters and what's sadly is they are weaker than those of S1. Too less shown of strong female characters of a real fighting with monsters. It was toooooo slow with action time . Just the army members fighting . Where are the people like on season one ? And lastly ... what's wrong with Cha hyun su screen time ? It was going fine in the beginning but then he disappeared for like 2-3 episodes not showing him at all. He has just a few lines and went from the special monster to a one of them and not even the strongest one as he should have been . The young girl took his place as now she is the biggest special one . I had hopes but I don't know how S3 is going to be . I only enjoyed the last episode of the whole new season, when finally the lead actor are on screen . I also loved those blue eyes while looking so hot at eun yoo as I really missed their interaction during S2. I pretty pleaseee put them more on screen. Song kang need to be there the most as the most important one .","

But seriously, The concept is actually pretty strong, mutated monsters with unique skills is interesting, but the story is just bleh and the sfx is passable. It's pretty obvious they want to make this into a long run series so everything just feels dragged so bad, you can skip five episodes and still pretty much gets it. The characters? Omfg the characters are just god awful, the main characters are overly edgy, the supporting characters are overly lame, both have anime logic and sensibility and overall unbearably annoying.If you don't like edgy manhwa you won't like this. Also i LOLed every time a wild 'imagine dragons' appear.","

"asmanraj","14 January 2021","I couldn't get into this show until the second episode, and the CGI is awful. However, starting with the second episode, this show becomes quite gripping. There is a particularly horrific scene in which a child is killed in front of her mother. The actress who plays the mother of the child deserves an award for her amazing performance. Part of what makes this show riveting is that it's not afraid to put characters who are children in peril and the show makes you genuinely afraid that a child could be killed. Also, it's refreshing that the evil creatures are monsters for a change instead of zombies. However, I have to deduct a point for a boring first episode and another point for awful CGI.","

"HardLight","29 August 2021","I found this series through the manhua based on it and was shocked when I found out that it was produced and created, I didn't expect something like Sweet Home to get a Live Action release when not even an animation of it had been done.And I like it, shockingly enough.Usually Live Action adaptions of works in manga/manhua/comic/book form these days I have a visceral dislike for as they're usually terrible, but this adapts part of the story well.Lets get to the deets tho, the actors are fine, they're usually as believable as possible for what they are playing though some of it comes across as a little hammy to my uncultured Western ears, it might be decent for Korean TV/Movies but I wouldn't know, this is literally the first piece of Live Action Korean cinema I've seen and like I said I like it. (well except for some of the portrayals, that woman clearly going crazy with the virus at the start giving the poor guard the rotten fish annoyed me to no end)Now we get to a little bit of the problems though.The series doesn't give time to let things breathe, the way things go in the series it's a VERY fast ride through the plot from beginning to end and in that quickness, there's a lack of needed connection for certain characters, leaving emotional deaths to be less than thrilling and the eventual end to be kind of anticlimactic.I would love to see more of this universe even though the manhua as (as far as I know) finished.In itself, it's a fun little zombie movie with some original ideas, while they're zombies they are also strange monsters too depending on who/what they were before they were infected. That's what drew me to the series in the first place and it's a fantastic story to see more of.All in all the only reason this isn't 10/10 is that quick rush to the end. If they'd let the story build a bit more, have the heroes at a half way point and let this move into a season 2 I think it would be a perfect series.But aside from that, it's fantastic.As always (without very few notable exceptions) the netflix dub is atrocious and I suggest watching this on original language with subs if you don't speak Korean, the VA's in it are terrible in English and like most things these days dubbed into English, I avoid that like the plague.","

"berg-74532","13 April 2021","If this was an American series it would get torn apart and all you have to do is look at the ratings of any of similar shows that have been on TV other than WD or AHS and even those are have lower overall ratings. An anti American bias by Americans taints every bit of pop culture this gets a boost it deserves simply by it not coming from the US. I love this show it's not only a great horror show it's also an excellent mystery and has spots of comic relief. The story the acting the pace and its presentation are all excellent and while the CGI is not the best it's good enough that it's not unintentionally funny.","

I do think that Asian horror series and movies are kind of too much about their ""horror scenes"" but this isn't the case here. Although it has some scenes to prove its theme there isn't much attention paid to them. I really liked the plot and I loved the different details and personas of every character. The whole series is fascinating and keeps you on edge all the time. It's like every episode ends with a cliffhanger. The background stories of the characters are very interesting and I liked how the series although it has a dark theme it pays much attention to the relationships and emotions among humans. I would really recommend it to anyone who likes horror-action series.","

"CyricTheCynic","5 May 2021","This is a pretty solid horror show and an interesting premise at that. Rather than just a straight up infection turning people into monsters, the nature of what is turning people into monsters is left intentionally vague, though it is affected by the type of person. There is a lot of human drama and issues dealing with surviving in an enclosed area with limited resources. The actors/actresses are good for the most part, though there is a disconnect where some characters are super emotive and over the top and others and barely responsive given the situation. The one thing that I thought could have been better were the effects. While I understand that it is a lower-budget show, it's just that a lot of the CG, especially the monsters, felt out of place. Some of the CG looks pretty good, other CG not so much, but it just doesn't really mesh well together. If all the CG was low-budget but had a more consistent art style and direction I think it would have been alot better. Still, a pretty good show.","

"moviegoo","11 June 2021","I would rate this lower, but it was at least a fun show to watch. Sweet Home is a Netflix series based on the famous Webtoon 'Sweet Home'. Now I haven't finished reading the Webtoon, but from what I have read it is much better than this. From the same creator as 'Bastard', one of my favourite Web series, it's hard to see his work being vandalised with this ""bastardised"" live adaptation.Now it isn't all bad, the show is at least fun and creative. The start of the show was good for the most part, but already from the start the monsters looked a bit silly, and the acting was oddly overdone. Then we start to see a bit of divergence in storytelling compared to its source material; while not always a bad thing, with The Shining being one of my favourite movies - which diverged so much from the book, this is another good example of ""if it isn't broke, don't fix it"". The show introduces monsters with barely any explanation of their backstories or the reason they are the way they are. This is annoying as the manhwa clearly illustrates each character and monster and their purpose and reasoning for existing. This gets you invested and explains the weirdness of what's going on. While they do this with some monsters, some of the weirder ones like the charger from ""Left4Dead 2"" who always says ""protein"" or the Usain Bolt zombie having 0 explanation coke across as the dumbest designs in the whole show, despite being the most intensely interesting ones in the book.It doesn't help not explaining things, but it gets worse with how disjointed scenes are. I genuinely felt like I was accidentally skipping episodes with how shitty the overall pacing, where you have one character being chased down being spliced next to him being safe. It leaves me more confused than I need to be. What's worse is that they also fill in the rushed pacing with blank stares and drawn out scenes that in the manhwa existed for a page usually. There are some key moments in the book that were handled so well because of the tension created, but in the Netflix adaptation scenes would be spliced with non-essential scenes that would completely break up the flow and tension.The overall feeling of emptiness, tension, sadness, horror that was created by the book is completely ruined by the over-dramatic acting and the poorly slapped on ""Imagine Dragons Warriors"" song that wouldn't stop playing. With scenes dragged out, dumb looking monsters, disjointed script writing, and what felt like a completely different story being screwed onto the ending, I can't see why you'd want to waste your time with this. It's fun, but in the mindless-bed-ridden-mood kinda way.","

"jeremiaharakus","18 December 2023","This show caught me immediately when I watched the first season a few years ago. I found the concept unique and fascinating, and the focus on a tight knit community and their personal struggles gave each encounter with the mysterious horrors they were facing a sense of weight and gravitas. These initial episodes were beautifully paced, giving each character's personality time to shine, and giving plenty of moments of heartfelt levity to balance the brutality. Throughout the course of the season, I grew to know each of the characters and care about what happened to them. Needless to say, I was pretty excited about season 2, and even rewatched all of season 1 when it came out, in order to refresh my memory. The shift in tone between seasons was immediately evident. Gone was the thoughtful, character-centric storytelling, in favor of over the top action sequences full of bland monsters, countless non descript soldiers with big guns and flame throwers, car chases that would be at home in a Vin Deisel movie, and plenty of uninteresting new characters that never show much more personality than a wet paper sack.Even the season 1 characters lost their personality this season. There was nothing to distinguish them from the faceless mobs around them, and no moment to breathe with them and get to know them on a deeper level. It was simply a rush from one disaster to another, with nothing in between except some screaming and sobbing. Even when they killed off some of my favorite characters in cheap and unsatisfying ways, I found that I didn't really feel anything. They just didn't even seem like the same people I had gotten to know in the first season.I really wanted to like season 2. I tried very hard to. The storytelling was simply half baked and didn't give the audience a chance to connect with the charcters before sending them into disaster after disaster. Season 1 seemed to grasp that the bad stuff hits way harder when there's some good stuff and human connection mixed in. I wish the writers of Season 2 had picked up on that, and I really hope that Season 3 fixes that mistake.","

"IamGrtl","5 February 2023","Here is where reading IMDb reviews gets tricky. I watched happiness and sweet home back-to-back because the former had received better reviews than the latter.I realized that the reason for the difference in reviews was probably that while sweet home has a larger worldwide audience, happiness was probably seen largely by Korean drama lovers.I'm trying to say that this one is by far better. The plot is well-developed, and the characters' decisions make sense (which is not something you should take for granted with series nowadays).Although the CGI isn't the best, I've seen worse, so in all honesty, I wasn't bothered by it at all.This is kind of horror, even though I honestly think that only the first episode is kind of scary (trust me I get scared easily. However, it does feature a lot of blood, so if you don't like that, I can assure you that this series is not for you.I am very excited about the two seasons that will be released in June 2023.There are only two things that I would have added or changed. The first one is about Hyun's past, which isn't really clear, and I had to watch the scenes more more once to roughly understand what was happening. Also, I would have liked to see more of the impulses that turned people into monsters. I mean, that particular feature distinguishes this series from other post-apocalyptic zombie series. Although I haven't read the original webcomic from which this series was adapted, I'm sure both of the points I noted are better explained there. I hope they will concentrate on it more in the upcoming seasons.If you like apocalyptic, gore, thriller series and you want to try a kdrama this one is the best I've seen so far.","

"siggirules","26 January 2021","Man, this show was something, I definitely recommend it to every horror fan out there. It's a fresh take on the tired zombie-siege formula with a great set of characters, great performances ans most importantly fantastic monster designs used in creative set-pieces.If I would have rated this after the first 3 episodes, this would have been an easy 9, unfortunately the show can't keep the pace and sharp writing of it's opening up and deflates to an extend. The best monsters and set-pieces are delivered up-front, while we are getting more character focuses later on. This by itself wouldn't have been bad, since the human stories are good ones and the investment in the peoples fates is definitely there, but the show really struggles to move the plot along after things settle. The writers really struggle to give people something to do and random side quests pop-up that are almost immediately dropped after an anti-climatic resolution. There is also a weird editing structure at place I never got used to, where the show would give us flashbacks to past conversations or basically extended versions of prior scenes where something was said or done, that only becomes immediately relevant after the flashback. There seems to be no faith in the audience to keep track of character motivations and relationships over multiple episodes.
Also rules are very inconsistent, first it's a big deal that monsters can't be killed, plenty of monsters are killed. Wearing headphones should alert you to monsters presence, people with headphones get jumped by monsters all the time and so on...Lastly, it becomes a pity party quite often, I was worried the besieged apartment building would sink in the lake of tears generated by the people trapped inside. It is standard for Asian cinema, but still a bit too much some times.That sound overly negative, but make no mistakes, the show is good overall, you come for the monsters, you stay for the survivors. The creature design is great throughout, the CGI holds up most of the time (whit a couple of bad shots, mainly involving a hulking monstrosity) and the practical effects are top notch like the overall production value. If we get a second season I hope the overall plot is paced much better and the emotions will be dialed back a bit","

I felt it was artistic.The storyline had me hooked. I ended up invested in many of the characters, including the secondary characters - for me that's tough to do. At first I was afraid the show would shy away from certain themes - heavens to betsy was I wrong. They didn't pull the punches or baby us through the drama. This seriously touched me. I'm raving about it.There are several interesting story lines that I hope they unravel in season 2 - fantastic take on monster drama (monsdrama) - and I'm on the edge of my seat for the next season.

I can't comment on dubbing other than don't use it for anything, ever.It's an interesting take on the zombie/monster genre. But if you get interested by the first few episodes you might later regret feeling the need to stick through and see how it ends. By the last few episodes I was losing interest. Several characters are intolerable. Some likable characters are sidelined. Some events are over the top to the point that it's frustrating. It sometimes goes too far on pointless shock value, and other times not far enough. It's not a terrible show if you're looking for monster/horror/apocalypse/survival, but I found it getting old by the end.","

"vioplxx","16 August 2023","As an avid fan of the horror genre and a dedicated viewer of K-dramas, ""Sweet Home"" had me intrigued from the very start. With confirmation of an impending second season sometime at the end of 2023 and an announced third season, it's the perfect time to reflect on this series.First things first, it must be said that the initial experience may throw you off. The first half of the first season threw me into a sea of confusion, as the dialogues came across as eerily emotionless and the characters seemed strangely unfazed by the unfolding apocalypse. They all felt like they didn't care about anything at all as the world fell apart around them and the extremely unnatural way in which dialogues were written didn't help. It all felt uncanny, and what seems even weirder is that it wasn't written like that by mistake. It was very deliberate and made me drop the show the first time I tried watching it.Yet, as the series went on, it seemed like the puzzle pieces started falling into place. And fall they did, around the midpoint of the first season, when the seemingly disjointed elements suddenly clicked into a coherent narrative. This part, though belated, was like a light in the darkness, and I appreciated how the creators skillfully justified their earlier enigmatic approach. In hindsight, I see the purpose it served, but I can't help but wonder if it could have been executed better. Based on my own experience, I assume that by the time the writers decided to reveal why the characters are the way they are, half of the people watching would have already dropped the show.Once the fog lifted, ""Sweet Home"" transformed into a tale of survival in a surprisingly interesting world, in which humans turned into monsters, who are actually embodiments of their deepest desires. This concept is nothing short of fascinating, and the creative design of these creatures truly deserves applause. I also love how they decided not to explain what each of these monsters is supposed to represent, leaving the viewer to decipher them on their own.The series' choice of the song ""Warrior"" by Imagine Dragons adds a layer of energy and intensity that complements the overall atmosphere. However, I must admit that the song's consistent appearance during major epic moments sometimes triggered unexpected laughter on my end, disrupting the intended awe. It's a minor setback, but one that's worth mentioning.I love when TV shows are bold. And ""Sweet Home"" is damn bold. What truly sets it apart is its willingness to shatter expectations. The abrupt and often unceremonious deaths of seemingly important characters kept catching me off guard, emphasizing the unforgiving nature of the apocalyptic setting. It's a risky move that effectively conveys the constant danger lurking around every corner, and I applaud the show for its audacity. In simpler words - if you haven't read the webtoon, then you will never expect who lives and who dies, and the show will kill your favorite character in seconds, without making it overtly dramatic.I'd also like to add that ""Sweet Home"" is beautiful, in the literal sense of the word. Aesthetically pleasing in every sense, the show captures its post-apocalyptic world with stunning attention to detail. The special effects are second to none and it's one of the reasons why I decide to watch Korean cinema over your regular western Netflix shows. Koreans always put a lot of effort into the worlds they create, putting enormous budget into special effects, even if the show in question is a risky endeavour and might flop completely. This particular series was very risky, because it's super weird and unique, instead of being your typical post-apocalyptic zombie flick you watch on a Friday evening and forget, and they still put $27 million into the first season itself (most of it, VFX I assume, since the cast isn't exactly well known)! Oh, Koreans also don't tend to cancel their shows if they're underselling, which is something Netflix US is consistent in :)As I look back on my journey through ""Sweet Home,"" I find myself torn. On one hand, the confusing first half of the first season left a significant dent in my overall enjoyment, but on the other hand, the second half redeemed the series with its narrative and jaw-dropping revelations. While I think the show has potential to be a perfect 10/10, the initial confusion holds it back. As of now, it stands at a solid 8/10, with hopes that the upcoming seasons will continue to elevate this rating.","

Specially when Hyun-su changes for real. I was like, Yes B***h that's how you do it. That was the best. I can't believe I cried too in a thriller-horror genre. But no regrets. The plot was well made and the acting was on point by each and ever character. Was happy to see a different side of Do Hyun. Song Kang, how the hell did you look handsome even after changing into monster is beyond me.","

"majesticforeplay","5 December 2023","There were a lot of unnecessary.characters in season 2, like what's the point of introducing all those characters that we don't even feel.any empathy for. There were some moments where we were supposed to feel sad, but did not get through because of the TERRIBLE acting. Typical korea, interesting premise at first but always dragging the story with NONSENSE for the sake of more content.Did you guys see those CGI? Ugh, those are the worst CGI I've ever seen. Especially when the army were being chased by some transformer-like monster, like what the F dude. It feels like they are using the same model and put 20 of them in the same frame for the sake of creating a tense situation in that scene, and then fail horribly because of the crappy CGI. Like bruh ain't all the monster have their own special trait? What is this mass produced transformer monster? If you guys are not good at creating CGI then minimize the use of it.","

"CJWar","11 December 2021","The first few episodes of the show had me completely invested in it. From episode 7 onwards, it lost me. The writing is just too inconsistent. Far too much time is spent on characters introspection, and not enough spent reinforcing the world the writers are trying to build.I Googled a few questions I had about the show and came across post after post - from those who have read the web comic - lamenting the fact that certain information wasn't included in the show, and questioning why background information was included. I have to agree with them. Far too much time is spent showing us flashbacks. We don't need ""origin"" stories as the characters are already in a dire situation that's going to change their personality going forward. What we need are explanations of why certain events are happening now, why certain monsters seemingly appear from nowhere and a bit more time spent showing us character interactions in the here-and-now.The soundtrack is good. Unlike some, I also really like the CGI. Yes, it's cheap but it's well done and the style appeals to me. Some of the early monsters are reminiscent of those glimpsed in old films like Beetlejuice.","

So many great characters got deleted from existence. On top of that, the pacing was super slow, heck, even slower than a snail. The main character does not even feel like he is the main character. Instead, the side characters feels more like the MC. How is that even possible? I swear the MC literally has like 30 minutes of screen time in THE ENTIRE SERIES. Furthermore, the character development in this series abosolutely close to zero. NONE! I seriously don't understand how this drama even got higher rating than 3. K-drama watchers are delusional.","

Didn't expect anything and loved the wierd, quirky residents of the building. And then the monster came - and man are they awesome!! Totally could see it as a video game ala Resident Evil or Silent Hill.
BUT around half way through it felt like they had fired all their good shots - less monsters, and mainly people sitting around /talking /crying or fighting each other. (maybe they were out of budget?!)
10* for the first half and 5-6* for the second.All together still very watchable","

"Stephan_fr","19 June 2022","Sweet home is not particularly original by international movie standard - the first episode is a direct hommage to Delicatessen, and it's second episode a direct-to-film adaptation of a webtoon, complete with upside down camera shots. We've seen it all before.However, from episode 4 onwards, it really picks up pace and starts asking some interesting questions. Confucianism clashes with Christianism in an excellent mish mash unlike anything on Netflix.Another excellent point is that it doesn't cater to its financiers woke values, and maintains traditional Korean values at its core throughout. A bresh of fresh air in a world of woke ignorance. Based K-drama to the rescue?Sweet Home also shines in the SFX departement. It drops the 'Rotoscope' effects by episode 3 and by episode 9 it's on par with Hollywood. The characters are interesting, and the plot is helped tremendously by the clever ploy through which people 'turn' into monsters, which I won't spoil for you.A must watch for anyone into the mystery/thriller genre-fiction with some element of horror/suspense.","

This is not your average Asian series. At first, I didn't like the combination of Drama and SF but later it didn't matter so much. This show is so good made, that mostly all events go together smoothly.
If you did like Stranger Things, ""Sweet Home"" is a must-try.","

Producers/writers/directors cant seem to get it right with this genre of shows anymore and every 10 shows made, 9 of them are pretty disappointing. Yes, I'm talking about the failure of Monarch Legacy of Monsters as well.You want a good monster show? Watch Gyeongseong creature instead.Sweet Home S2 was like, malicious defiance. They have source material to put to screen, instead they go offrail on this messy path where they try to make a sidestory the main plot. So only the first 3 episodes pick up from S1, then its a completely different story, they killed off most of the S1 characters that we want to see or took away most of their screen time, introduced more factions that add more confusion.A lot of supposed critical parts of the plot are not explained. For example, what happened to the monsters now becoming generic, cookie cutter replicas, no longer the unique mutated human-monsters that we saw in S1.The S2 cliffhanger ending was really bad, cliche and cringey and testament to incompetency of the writing/directing efforts (Why precisely that person, and the process was also not explained).**Abit of spoilers**The doctor also supposedly had a cure but it somehow became irrelevant, instead he brought a luggage out for no reason, randomly found a monster egg (?) when he wanted to poop, just nice had his empty luggage he brought randomly that had could perfectly fit the big specimen...

"Lukasmj","16 November 2022","After an unexpected family tragedy, Cha Hyun-soo leaves his home and moves into an apartment. Soon after, monsters begin appearing. People inside the apartment are trapped inside the building, realizing that monsters are lurking everywhere outside. Hyun-su and other residents shield themselves inside the building in the hope of surviving as long as they can.I really liked ""Sweet Home"".Yes, the overacting is a bit ridiculous here and there, but that's typical Asia.But the story is actually quite interesting and what I particularly remembered were the special effects. They turned out really well in my opinion.Update after season 2:
Unfortunately, in its second season the series loses all the charm that made it so special in the first season.The first season was special because the horror of the series arose from the fact that the residents have to stay in this residential complex and there is no escape from this situation. In addition, the monsters in the first season were designed in a really interesting way.In the second season the whole thing somehow develops into a mediocre ""The Walking Dead"" clone. The characters now roam through the landscape and are attacked here and there. Then someone is infected or injured and mistrust arises. The monsters no longer contribute anything except to shock and their design is now largely very boring.Season 2 also introduces about 15 new characters, which is just too many to introduce all at once. What's worse is that these characters are all also interchangeable and boring, except for one character who is quite interesting.That's why I'm reducing the rating from 8 times to 7.I'll take a look at the third season, but I don't have high expectations.It's a shame, it really could have been something new and unique...","

I am starting to become a fan of Korean acting, especially in Sweet Home, where everyone has a story that slowly unfolds with each episode and nobody are who they seem. The makeup is great with realistic scenes and the monsters CGI are a blend of new animation and classic effects. The latter episodes include a few more emotions and tears but the entertainment is still there -- you can't have all action and no back story for the entire season. All in all I really enjoyed it.","

"jpburrett","8 February 2024","Season one was one of the most creative horror shows going. You never knew what the next monster would be and each one was unique based on the whole monsterization curse.Everything a new one showed up itnwas exciting to see what it could do.All of the characters where well thought out and you got a good sense of who they where as it went on.Season 2 is not bad but feels like a completely different show. The first part follows the original group and is really tense even has a shock moment. All leading up to the frankly epic stadium moment.Then it jumps forwardHalf the original characters are gone and apart from a couple of standouts the monsters have all become generic CGI blobs.One scene with the army group fighting a horde with cut and paste versions if the same monster took everything away from the unquie ideas.It mostly revolves around said army groups squabbles and chest beating. Meanwhile a monster subplot is there but again very slow and not that much monster going on.Its still good and will keep watching but I want my monsters as advertised.","

Rather it come from acting directing the writing the casting department and people who look for screens. When it comes to the art of storytelling and then transferring the storytelling into English for American movie watchers/television series show watchers. Everything should honestly makes sense. Nothing in this show makes sense from start to beginning to the roles that people are playing in the show the stupidest characters with in the show are the females and their responses to everything. If this is the way people conduct themselves in Korea is a situation like this was to occur. Then the show should've just ended with a nuclear bomb being dropped on Korea. I've never seen failure and entertainment on such a grand scale.","

However the story is all over the place, so I agree with everyone who says it starts well but gets boring because of slow pacing and disjointed story telling. It's hard to follow also cause the characters all look the same and the korean names dont help, everyone is like Jun Jin Jon, Kwon bun bam, cin ciun lan, who the hell remembers that. And yes the CGI is that of a low budget straight to dvd movie, but if they paid a bit more attention to crafting a better structured story I would have excused it. In the end disappointing.","

'Sweet Home' Season 2This is an apocalyptic survival drama based on webtoon, where humans turns into monsters.Season 2 came after 3 years.I didn't like S 1, but this time, I find myself enjoying the show. As per webtoon readers, this season is not loyal to webtoon. There are many new characters introduced.Drama has a mixture of Stranger things, Sweet Tooth, Last of US, Walking dead like such similar shows. CGI is hit-miss, there are some plotholes but for me it was intriguing throughout.Though my Song Kang was only there for 4 episodes

Eun-yoo has nothing to offer in the story. She is a petty heroine with tough girl act. That's it. On most cases she can't do anthing uself other then put on a tough girl act. What was the creator thinking? They killed off all the characrers that made the season 1 so interesting. They should have made a more compaling heroine. Season 2 seems like it is not going anywhere. The story is quite blend. I loved the season 1 and seen the whole season with full attention. But with season 2 I had to skip most parts.","

"jovpsyho","15 October 2022","The cgi is kinda wonky at some scenes but the whole show grips you in and it just wants more. I love the lack of the whole Wokeness and inclusivity trash that we are being served from the west. And it is so nice watching a show where the plot is just keep on keeping on. With the status of western shows these days ill watch anything that is not Ms. Marry Sue defeats bad white man by beaing better than bad white man. It has been a long time since i watched a show and went daym i want more and not gasp and say finally its done jeeez what a pain. I cant shower enough praises to korean shows and i hope the whole production steps it up a little bit in the cgi department. That is my only critique so far. Compared to the billion dollar show i watched recently the acting in Sweet Home is good. The show is binge material and i cant wait to see more.","

"AJx91","29 April 2021","Tldr; It was more of a suspense and teary eyed jerker. Everyone waiting on Season 2 before really giving it a ""Yay"" or ""Nay."" If anything, at least watch for Lee Si-Young's amazing back abs, which I didn't even know was possible. I had to rewind that part to make sure I wasn't hallucinating-lol.If you looking for something that has great Action? This isn't it, you be better off watching a Shonen Anime or John Wick.You want some Romance? It is almost non-existent even though love is thick in the air, they don't try to progress further than that.Scary? It definitely have its' horror elements, but I can think of scarier things like the 13 ghost or Exorcist. Out of the 3 categories I mentioned so far, it does this the best; while mixing in drama and sadness. If anything, what hooks u from episode to episode, is to uncover the mystery as into why everything is so screwed up.It reminds me a lot of #Alive except, instead of Zombies you have people turning into different types of Monsters; and there is a MUCH bigger cast of characters. With the main protagonist giving you Kaneki vibes from Tokyo Ghoul.Lastly, be prepared to be left on a cliffhanger, if Netflix doesn't give it a Season Two, we are screwed. Overall I think it is average at best, but I still enjoyed watching it and would watch Season Two. To see if it gets better, before dropping it. I think it could have just done better in several other categories, like the ACTION! That was the biggest let down and the 2nd was Romance. I'm like screaming at the screen, ""Just freaking kiss already,"" at multiple moments, even up to the very end.","

"casanovaalex-64960","26 January 2021","The show I must admit does start slow but you will slowly see all these story elements come together in an amazingly creative way. You will grow attached to a lot of these characters due to the show's commitment to explaining their characters throughly. The actual monsters themselves are extremely creative and I'm surprised how many there are in these 10 episodes. The only downfall of this show has to be the GCI of some of the monsters. Others are extremely well made due to the show's commitment to makeup but others just have a look that can break immersion. Overall please don't sleep on this show and hopefully season 2 is on its way! A true revolution in horror TV!","

After 3 straight episodes of boredom and a huge lack of action, plot, or character development I can't justify wasting anymore time on this one. 3 stars for 3 really solid episodes of horror (again with terrible CGI)","

"kirilcvkirilov","27 July 2021","I've not read the source material if it matters.The plot isn't anything special, but it isn't bad. Execution is overall terrible, tho.CGI was god awful for this day and age. Guessing it's from low budget, but that doesn't make it any better to look at.The worst cinematography I've ever seen. There were part of scenes that were missing entirely, honestly didn't it was possible for this to happen. Scenes would get so chopped up that you wouldn't be able to tell what just happened.If you don't like Imagine Dragons stay away from this show, every episode has a dose of them, makes the corny moments even cornier.And yes, show is overly corny at times and the acting can get terrible.Please take my review in to consideration. I never though a piece of entertainment could be this bad and make me wonder how anyone could enjoy it. I truly think it's a waste of time and I want to save a couple of people from slogging through this mess, hoping it would get better the next episode.","

"rallder19","27 March 2022","It wasn't bad and it wasn't good. For anyone out there who has ever taken anti-depressants in your life, you know how they don't really make you feel happy or sad? ... how they just kind of create a lack of emotion entirely? That's pretty much exactly how this show makes you feel.. like you don't know whether to keep watching or turn it off or why they even bothered in the first place.There was zero heart and soul put into this. Reminded me of a project where nobody really cared about it and they were more focused on getting it done rather than take the time to connect the story to their audience.This is the show equivalent to eating cold 2-day old leftovers from Olive Garden. Like.. sure it still tastes good I guess.. sort of... I mean I think? Let's just say it's passable but I certainly need to have something better tomorrow to make up for it.","

There's only one thing I would change but it was unique that they played out the scene that way. I'm sure you'll catch it too. I'm on episode 9 and I loved the show so much I had to leave a review. I don't want it to end luckily there's a season 2 coming. I've been waiting too long to start season 1 partly because i would try watching it at night and it can get scary/thrilling.

"xmasinswiss","14 December 2023","... but it has to be done. I watched Season 1 in a binge, it was captivating, fresh and terrifying. The monsters made perfect sense in the story's universe, meeting them was intense, and I felt sorry for quite a few monsters and humans.Enter Season 2.Military-style shoot-them-all-up mess with people and monsters running around and screaming. I got lost in the multitude of uninteresting characters, in random plot lines, in who likes/loves who and who wants to kill who and why. The stupid monster fights were boring because I was totally uninvested emotionally, so I just skipped them. Monsters became some strange zombies and robot-like transformers, howling somewhere in the distance and randomly attacking in large packs? Why?Overall - 10/10 for Season 1, -7/10 for Season 2.What a horrible continuation of an outstanding beginning. Looks so amateurish it's painful.","

"larmo","3 January 2021","I really enjoyed this series. The mix of horror, drama, and cinematography are well done. In regards to the cinematography, it's not about great vistas and scenery. It's the way the actors are filmed. The acting is very good, many of the actors are really quite good looking. While I rarely like Action or horror productions that dwell overly on human relationships, because the writing is often not very good and melodramatic. I found myself reasonably invested in the fortunes of the various characters and the group as a whole. The CGI is professional, but much of the series is not about monsters, but about people trying to survive. Threats come from different and unexpected sources, which kept me involved. I would be very happy to see a second season if they decide to produce one.","

"charleslanobucklin","9 January 2021","The show's first few episodes were terrific. Great monsters and special effects. About midway the nihilism and the convoluted plot derail what could have been an Awesome series. The ending makes no sense and is clearly a half assed set up for a second season. Also, the MC is quite frankly a sad sack from beginning to end - so don't expect any redemptive character arc. Every episode is filled with people emoting and crying constantly - which works in the first few episodes but becomes numbingly tedious as the show continues to its conclusion. The actors are all uniformly good and are given some space to really shine. However, even the character standouts are eventually left stranded by the nonsensical script. Worth watching though but don't expect to leave the table satisfied.","

"kriszti-39900","27 February 2021","I found the concept brilliant. Many monsters of all sizes and shapes with different abilities. I also loved the characters or loved to hate some of them. My only problem was that around the middle the story became slower. There were some interesting background stories which made up for it, but still, I think maybe some more monsters could have appeared in order to fill the space. I didn't like that some scenes were just cut off. For example: two characters were struggling with a monster, one of them was willing to sacrifice himself (if necessary), so the other character could go and help the others. The camera goes with the 2nd guy and the other one is left alone with the monster. The 2nd guy then does, what he has to do and later on the first guy joins the group. As if nothing had happened before. I would have expected to see some details about how he managed to get away and get rid of the monster he was fighting against. I have the same problem with the end. The main character gets shot at and he is badly injured, then all of the sudden he is in a back of a car. I would have liked to see how he managed to get into the car. Despite of these it was a refreshing little tale and hope to get a second season - with a plenty more monsters.","

"adambenjamingibbons","24 April 2023","So I started watching this and it was weird, suspenseful and was looking like a good scary series. Lots of creepy things that weren't scary but left you with that feeling you were about to get a fright any minute. To be honest I thought to myself this is going to be amazing. Then all of a sudden, half way through the episode it became an absolute cheesefest. It was like they just swapped out the writers, producers and directors with clueless people. OTT hit stupid levels. Plot swapped to full on zombie scenes and what a joke it was. By the end I was undecided but the last scene was so rediculous I just thought no more. They literally instead of making a consistent group of zombie characters tried to do one of every stereo typical zombie you could imagine, to the point it just looked like they had borrowed costumes, or CGI of every horror film ever made. You're talking axe wielder, chainsaw guy, guy with head split in half, woman upside down in crab position. Every cheesy, stereotypical horror creature possible.Weird how something promising just flipped in to a disaster in seconds.1/10 because it was a waste of time and although I enjoyed about 30 mins, it was pointless because I won't be sitting through any more of the rubbish that followed.","

I know you 're most likely gonna' like the series, especially if you like the horror, thriller & action genre. Tbh, it wasn't exactly in my type of movies. WIth this I mean, I really 'd feel better if there was more monster action as the drama, the interpersonal relationships, crimi, etc aren't among the things that provoke interest in me, but, well, different people, different points of view. You can check out the series on Netflix, and if you like the first 2-3 episodes, then you'd like the rest, too. You will partial find similarity to the Gantz movies, the feeling can be somewhat close, but I guess this is just Asian style, and it feels good. I hope there 'll be season two on Netflix to check out.","

This serie is entertaining, it manages to create some tension and despite being cartoony, you can relate with the charaters tribulations. It has a fairly good cinematography and despite the budget, they have created some elements that work well. That said, if you´ve come because of the featuring monsters, this is for you. The rest is just kind of bad. For the plot and the story itself are nothing more than junior soap opera filled with clichés and basically more of the same. By now we have seen these kind of dilemas a million times over, and they make no effort to put a spin on this take. If you don´t mind the setting, like some monster flicks, you could do worse than this.","

Monsters with unique abilities are turned into zombies with 0 creativity, some of them turned into cheap transformers. New characters with no background, no story. Focused on army who has no idea with that they are doing. I don't even know what was the concept for this story.Don't even dare to like any single character, he'll be dead in the next moment. So many cliffhangers. I bingewatched s1, and it gave me vibes like Alice in Borderland that raised my hype for s2 even more. But it was totally disappointing.","

From start to finish it was a Rollercoaster of creepiness, scares, emotions and awesome character development. Never got boring for even a second and the monsters are really cool and deep if you are paying good attention to the story. Most monsters in horror movies don't even make much sense but in this series it does make sense. Because I got pretty tired of horror movies with the classic its just a bunch of meaningless jumpscares and enemies that are just there to fill the plot. No more blubbering. Go watch this series right now and you won't regret it. Excited for season 2 and what is has to offer! (Also I had to give it 9/10, - 1 because of some fight scenes being a little rushed. But still, a series definitely worth watching!)","

"beargod-48706","3 January 2021","Someone wrote, don't give up after the first episode. I feel exactly the opposite, the first 3-4 episodes were excellent. After that it became more soap opera with every episode. Probably Koreans will say this is not that Korean, that it is a westernized version. I'm Hungarian so viewing this series it seemed very Asian to me. The interaction, the greetings, the politeness and manner, relationships between characters are very Asian. For example the relationship between the guy with the sword and the bass player girl (I'm sorry but the names were really difficult to me to know) is just a platonic love and then the guy dies. In a western film there would have been at least kissing but more likely sex. Or the long takes on the meaningful gazes of the characters.In the first couple episodes the monsters are excellent, but around the 7-8 th episode it dies down the story becomes more drama driven. The music was mixed, it tried to have classical and modern pieces alike. They seem to have bought the Warriors Imagine Dragons song (which I'm sure was pretty expensive) so they overplayed it.
Yeah I get it, the real monsters are the humans losing their humanity in this series, but that took away the horror part too fast.There are some illogical parts or plot holes like monsters don't die. But the first one (the women that wants to kill Hyun-Su) dies directly after being her faced kicked into pulp and after that several monsters are killed of.Overall a really good experience and it kept me watching but to be honest it was getting more predictable and flat nearing the end.","

"wichtigesbuch","16 January 2021","4/10 for the horrible cgi monsters which brings the whole drama down, esp since the show is based on these monsters. Oh ya, the building is also a horrible cgi.it was made in 2020, and this is the cgi? ugh!
Hm what else? let's see, the plot is alright so far. I was scared a lot. It has a quite few heart stopping moments.
However, I'm already seeing some of the korean specific trope, namely, the mother whose daughter is outside and wants to open the gate. I just hated how the other characters didn't let her go the 2nd time. Like hey man, personal choice/decision, the mother has a functional mind; she can consent. She wants to go outside and die? Let her try and die. Stop keeping her and endanger the rest of group. Alright, the first time I understood why they couldn't open the door. Heck, even I wouldn't let her. I'd fight her tooth and nails and override her reckless decision to endanger not only herself, but others too. But bish when she did it again secretly and opened the freakin door, it's time to cut some losses and kick her out of the door. She wants to go that badly to save her daughter? LET. HER. The door was open and they held her back???( I could see that plotline a mile away because THIS is KDRAMA. This is train to busan all over again when the grandma opened the door. ) I can't believe they had literally noone to keep an eye on her after her 1st attempt. Who's stupid enough to let her off completely without 2nd thought? Oh another thing, the bish was not punished for her action. Instead, they had characters be like ""oh, no her daughter's dead."" Ya, well, what about the solider who died unnecessarily trying to save her? (ya, they don't talk about it.) Tbh, they should have the mother try to rescue her daughter to give her some closure. and wth was her daughter doing outside anyway with all those mosnters? how did she make it that far? makes no sense.
oh last thing, i hate seeing that actor in the wheelchair. he's everywhereeeeeeeee. i'm tired so seeing the same face again and again.","

At the beginning, the series has really good pace in building the environment. It shows the empathy between humans are significantly important in this world. However the appearance of the monster is reduced, the series introduces new enemies. It throw off the balance of the movie and the dialogue are made unnaturally.","

"thegermanhermit","3 January 2021","This show is utterly fantastic. The evolution of the characters over the course of 10 episodes is done subtly but in a manner you grasp by the time you're done. This series is so much more than what you would expect and puts other shows of the same genre to shame. You'll run the full gambit of emotions and be left wanting more. 10 out of 10 and truly hoping for a season 2.","

"divemabini","17 August 2023","Ridiculous and cartoony.What started out as an interesting premise, devolves into a complete morass of characters acting like idiots and buffoons. I know shows love to have survivors that you'll hate, but the ones in this show are so unbelievable and annoying that they detract from the entire plot. More unbelievable is the behavior of the other survivors who tolerate and excuse their poor behavior, even when facing life and death situations. I mean come one! The weedwhacker scene where around 8 or so ARMED survivors just stand there and watch another guy die, simply for dramatic effect?And the gutless morons who turn ""brave"" instantly for no reason.And Korea's obsession with school bullies and how they have to work it into EVERY freaking show they make. Completely and totally unnecessary.The characters in this show had about 10,000 different ways they could have improved the eventual outcome. But, the writers choose the most implausible and ridiculous way forward during every confrontation. Leaving the viewer not caring a damn bit about any of them, as their actions are truly mind-boggling.Could have been so much better. But falls victim to attempts as being artsy. Which fail miserably. Yet, somehow it gets a second season. Scratches head and face palms Netflix.","

"truerock2","20 March 2021","I settle back to watch a Korean webtoon based apocalyptic horror TV series (released on Netflix on December 18, 2020) and confusedly hear the lead in score of ""Dies irae"" (which is something like a 17th century Latin based Requiem Mass). Not a Korean score - oh wait... it is... arranged by Cho Yoon Jung? So, this is why I watch foreign films. It broadens my perspective.I have low expectations in regard to this particular genre - but, I am pleasantly surprised, entertained and impressed.There is some very good acting in some well written and directed roles. For example, Lee Do-hyun as Lee Eun-hyuk the accepted leader of a building's survivors.
Another example, Lee Si-young as Seo Yi-kyung, a former firefighter.
I could list a dozen more.A problem are the character roles thrown in for comedic relief which are horribly conceived and delivered. If those roles had been rewritten as dramatic roles the series would have been better. The child roles were atrocious. For some reason the children typically shouted their dialogue.I think I am not familiar with Korean culture and perhaps I do not understand the acting. For example, when the characters would do a hysterical sequence it always came across as whiny-screaming (I listened with Korean audio and English subtitles). Perhaps that is how individuals act hysterically in Korea? Maybe I should listen to the English actors dub and see if that comes across better for an American?Regardless, the series is surprisingly entertaining and I think individuals who enjoy this genre will enjoy Sweet Home.","

It feels like 60% to 70% of the time people are mourning and/or crying and it just takes a way the horror feel you want to have. I do think that the idea of making a horror more emotional is good concept in itself, but this is way way way too much. I had a hard time finishing the series because of it, but the fact that it still made me want to finish reflects in my 7/10 rating.","

"simbiat","19 December 2023","I liked season 1 of the show. It was not perfect, but it was good. Season 2 - not so much.Though technically season 1 was not a thriller, it got very close to the genre on multiple occasions. The small location of the show kind of forced that. It forced neighbors into insane situation, where all hell breaks loose. Everything felt ""personal"". The situation was also nicely playing into characters' fears besides the obvious fear of the unique monsters.The ""team"" getting outside of the building made sense. This was actually driven by the plot and was totally fine, and I was excited to know what will happen to them. But instead of hell breaking even more loose, it was season 2, that broke lose.I do not think the issue is with the change of location, especially since at some point we get ""The Stadium"" which aims to replace an apartment complex from 1st season. I think the issue is with how ""mundane"" the monsters have become, and how there is no fear, no feeling of risk in \[almost\] everything shown in season 2.We no have lots of people, with lots of them having little to no effect on the plot and sometimes even no backstory. There are so many useless characters here, that this was the very first time for me, when I was unable to differentiate among quite a few of them, especially those in the military.Speaking of military: they are the main reason there is no feeling of risk. Even in the lore of the show in general it looks like ""whatever happens - Crow Platoon will handle it"". They are portrayed as the ultimate solution for everything. With almost no flow. ""Almost"", because their leader is often framed as if a villain for no real reason.The show also had a huge time-skip, that left a lot of things to viewers' guessing. And while time-skip itself is not a sin, the fact that familiar characters' actions now make little to no sense - is.You know what else does not make sense? The doctor. He is supposed to be smart, but he have not shown a single speck of intelligence, behaving like a total moron most of the time. I guess we need to think he is smart because he shows attitude to everyone, and talks to monsters (kind of).Speaking of monsters - they are no completely generic. Gone are the unique designs of monsters based on people's fears and emotions. All hail generic zombies. Really, most of the monsters you will see here are just regular zombies, but they look a bit more alive, I guess. They have no personality, which was the selling point of the 1st season.I don't know if original webtoon has the same problem - maybe it does. Or maybe it, at least, does not do this weird time-skip and handles things better and somehow makes everything make more sense. But as a TV show - watch just the 1st season and leave it at the cliffhanger. Do not waste your time on season 2.","

"daniellavdh","3 December 2023","Really enjoyed this drama both season 1 and 2.Season 2 really kept you on the edge of your seat towards the end. I liked that we got to see more of the other characters and what their stories were.Loved that in this season they also uped the thriller/horror parts it's what kept you wanting to see what happened next.The fact that ji-su also died so early on was a buzz kill as I really liked her character so think it was silly to kill her off, although she killed it in the few minutes we did see her.Yi kyung was also brilliant! But again wished we saw more of her also. Also more of her action scenes could've been great too.I personally think Sangwook also needed more scenes because it would've been more interesting to see him switch between the two personas but sadly we didn't.Eun yoo, felt like the whole of season two was about her and honestly it almost got boring , she was extremely reckless and immature and it always cost others and made the story seem like it was dragging.Lastly Cha Hyun Soo (Song Kang) as one of the male leads why did we only see him for 4 episodes? And only like 10 mins in those 4 episodes?! It was really disappointing we saw so little of him because we didn't really see where his story goes or could go. Hopefully in season 3 we see more of him.In conclusion it was a good season would definitely recommend watching but wish we saw more of the ENTIRE main cast members that survived.Excited for season 3 because Eun Hyuk makes a comeback too!!","

"seanhancock-96482","28 November 2021","Me and my partner had been watching another excellent Korean Series Kingdom which also hangs in the balance of being renewed by Netflix and transitioning to this was a bit jarring at first. The characters were cartoony, the music at times (certainly in the first few episodes) seemed a little ill judged. As the season progresses however and certainly after epsiode 3 we started to become hooked and by the end we had a very much fully fledged set of dynamic characters. The slightly naff K-pop (Sorry if you're a fan) had started to be toned down (by episode 3) and the ending to the series felt like you'd be taken on a real emotional ride with the comic book, almost Scott Pilgrim esque feel, had been completely eradicated. Funny, clever and some solid acting, I urge you to stick with it and you will be rewarded. Let's hope Netflix do the sensible thing and bring it back for more.","

The main character is both overpowered and has inner problems he needs to deal with to hold the power, which makes for an exciting and dynamic story. The monsters, which have a Resident Evil-style aesthetic, are unique and intriguing. They aren't good or bad, just people, as they should be. While I did start to feel a bit drowsy near the end of the first season, the ending was enough to wake me up. However, the ending was a bit of a letdown, but it sets up an intriguing premise for a potential continuation of the story.","

I know it's just an adaptation but when you are adapting such a masterpiece by carnby kim and miss such details it's a failure of an adaptation. The details in the webtoon is interlinked to the prequel, shotgun boy, and it really brings out the essence of the story but here we saw blunders in the first episode itself, the most obvious thing was the disturbingly deppresing behaviour of the MC that was not shown properly second adding new characters? Woah buddy sorry but that's a hard pass. Only giving this series a 3 stars because of the fact that it gave such a beautiful webtoon a chance to popularity.","

"nashks92","4 January 2021","Starts off well, and falls apart very quickly. The beginning was very well paced and even the CGI was pretty good. Then after a couple promising episodes in the show stops making sense and becomes a string of random plot lines and awkward emotional scenes where characters just stare at each other and cry, most of the time for no reason other than to kill time (this could have been 4 or 5 episodes instead, with fewer characters).
Eventually character development and motivations just fall apart and it becomes a mystery why anything happens or any character does anything.
Also a lot of seemingly important things happen that are never addressed again.","

When I saw the most recent reviews and their positive reaction, I decide to give it a chance. Started it with low expectations, but was completely drawn in after the first episode. I couldn't stop watching and watched the entire season in two days. I am still mind blown, hence writing my first review. It was so fun to watch, the story was an original twist on a doomsday scenario and I caught myself getting attached to characters that I usually don't care about. And I love that they didn't feel compelled to keep all the main characters alive. The backstory might be a little hard to swallow if you are not used to watching asian movies/series, however for me it did not take away from the main story too much. There were a few flaws here and there, but it actually gave the series character.
I absolutely hope season 2 will come and I also hope it will be as good.","

"shreyas-yakhob","24 December 2020","I've read the webtoon this was based on, and it was amazing. However, they've changed certain elements of the original story. Some of the characters are different - either different gender, different personality, different back story, different relationships, new characters and missing characters, to name a few.The show also deviates from the original story line despite the crux of it being the same. Now, this is an issue because some of the crucial parts of the original webtoon which makes us, as viewers, understand each character's motives and choices are non-existent in the show. The little backstory that they give us just feels like filler content without actual consequence. My opinion of the show when compared to the original webtoon, is that it is disappointing.However, let's judge this as a show of its own:The visuals look great but also terrible. The art feels like they have a good VFX team behind it, but the direction of the scenes with heavy use of the CGI just feels so low-budget. It kills the pseudo realism that the show could have portrayed.The soundtrack is fine, but the songs that they play during some of the action sequences feel so out of place. It does not fit the vibe of the show or the premise that has been set. The music feels like an attempt at overcompensating for the show's inadequacies elsewhere.The script is all over the place with terrible pacing, and if you have not read the webtoon before, you're left confused and hanging at certain times. It's not coherent. The characters are unexpectedly helpless in a situation where they could actually do something, and are sometimes the opposite. Without spoiling much, you'll find yourself at times pulling at your hair wondering why these characters made such absurd choices. Some choices just make no sense other than, it was the ""edgier"" choice. You don't even root for or think of the primary protagonist as the protagonist of the show.The only good thing this show has going for it is how well the acting is. I can't say much else about this. The show just feels like it had a lot of potential but fell below that quite hard.As a standalone show, I would give it a 6, but as a show based on the original webtoon, it's probably a 3 or a 4 for me.In conclusion, due to the show's terrible pacing and storytelling, it feels like a tribute or a homage to the original webtoon. However, as a fan, I am terribly disappointed in how they've butchered something so amazing.
TL;DR Incoherent plot, terrible pacing, poor direction of the visuals.","

"isaiavlad","1 August 2021","The first episode is a masterpiece and I was positively impressed by the camera angles they used to film the series, they made everything more intriguing. The character introductions, their interactions with one another seem somewhat out of this world but realistic nevertheless.Reading the reviews I see both the ones praising it and the ones trashing it have 50-70% helpfulness and to be honest it's well deserved: what I disliked was the show turning more ""basic"" as it went one and monsters becoming less and less common. It still managed to stay a solid good show until the end but the drop in quality is noticeable especially between the 1st and the rest of the episodes. They need to learn from The Walking Dead and not repeat their mistakes.The CGI is painfully obvious and some of the scenes may disturb the immersion, they really need to bump up the budget for the 2nd season. I also think that Warriors by Imagine Dragons shouldn't have been in this series, it didn't truly fit any scenes in which it was used and made me cringe a little, an original soundtrack would've been much better.I'm torn between giving a 7 or an 8 but since I feel like I have withdrawal symptoms and it has me longing for a second season I'll give it an 8.","

The cast and characters are well developed and set up. Story is interesting, you find yourself identifying and relating to the different characters.This also makes a lot of very good points about how a Korean society would have difficulty facing such a world ending situation. Where I am from we are accustomed to access to guns and other weapons - but how do you survive when citizens do not have access to such things and a single sword is the strongest weapon your group has for survival.","

"strassermarlies","29 December 2020","I wonder if the people who rated this poorly gave up too early. I was one of them, I gave it 5 stars and moved on. But something about it was intriguing, so I came back. Ep 1 was promising, then it went downhill, I dropped it after Ep 3, but when I came back and I didn't regret it. I'm now rating it with a solid 8. The characters were annoying, yes, but they grew on me. Many dialogues and reactions seemed rather stupid, but they leaded to some great scenes. This series has a nice atmosphere, beautiful actors with lots of charisma. I liked the soundtrack and the CGI (yes, I do!). My biggest issue was the storytelling. They told too many stories at the same time. You want to know what happens to a certain character, but you have to wait, because other stories get in the way. I would have preferred it, if they finished one story arc and then moved on. I wasn't bothered by this kind of storytelling that much later on, when the series progressed. Most likely because the characters grew on me, and I was equally invested in everyone of them. To make it short: interesting survival/zombie/monster plot with annoying characters who became less annoying the more you know about them, decent CGI, decent music, some very good coloring and atmosphere. Some very good directing, some very bad directing and yeah ... Could have been better, but they did a good job most of the time. Some scenes were really bad, some were brilliant. Sometimes the action was incredible, sometimes it looked cheap or they just skipped a scene so you didn't even know what happened. It is, what it is. And it was a nice watch and an emotional ride.","

"loverytropes","10 July 2022","Mmmh.. I had doubts about the series at first, because I was very confused with Song Kang's character. But as it progresses I became more interested, then I started understanding the whole monsters outside the building thing. Great acting from the cast but Song Kang takes the cherry on top of the cake: HE'S SO GOOD. He portrayed the character really well. Do-hyun was also amazing. Pretty nice so far, and would be better if there is season 2. Hopefully there is, because it ended in a slight mediocre fashion, but still not mediocre enough to drag the series down. Congrats to the Sweet Home team for their success!","

"gerardchalaux","28 December 2020","It's well worth watching, it's a good show, as expected from korean horror cinematography the characters are charismatic and the show is exciting and addictive, and full of emotion, but don't expect the storyline to make much sense. It's the kind of show you'll shout to the screen expecting characters to be smarter; but they won't.I hope there's gonna be a second season, there's still many questions with no answer, but for the looks of it this may be it; and that's fine.","

"lawesy-83036","15 August 2021","Got something a about it. Shame the budget, is around 10p. Annoying characters, weird decisions. Nothing really makes any sense. But for some reason I kept watching. I guess hoping it would get better.","

"kartavyakaushik","26 January 2024","At first I want to say Season 1 was a good one, I know this series was bad at storytelling but I ignored it in season 1 because it was not causing that much problem, Season 1 was interesting till the end but I want to say that season 1 ending was somehow not fitting and I honestly say till the end I was not able to get what the rubbish is going in the Character's minds and ""what's their next move""(I know this Quality fits in crime thrillers, twisted plots but in this scenario, it is nothing more than time waste).Lets talk about Season 2,
Season 2 is like a garbage piling in our rooms but we are just not throwing it out and just watching it or ignoring it.Honestly saying Season 2 was rubbish, Very bad in storytelling, Please dont ask me about characters because for them there are only bad/cursed words in my mouth, talking about mail lead(one wing man) I want to say that just what is his character he has power but dont use it, keep standing and crying and literally do the foolishest things you and I will do if we get those powers. Frankly saying I was waiting the whole second season to watch him do something, my mind was saying that now is the time when he will make a god-like entry but I was foolish to think that I can expect anything good from NETFLIX and finally talking about female leadssssssssss(Sorry my mouth is getting out of control.....BAD WORDS INCOMING....)
THE END.Sorry for the cringee in the title.","

"matthew1000","11 January 2021","It's Korean. So you kind of know what your going to be getting when it comes to the main characters. You always have the ""comedy rolls"" and there is no exception here. I can find these characters annoying, but in Sweet Home, there is definitely enough crazy monster stuff going on to take your mind of them.
This is not perfect but very enjoyable. The story does start to fade to the end, maybe two episode to long.","

"brontee-campbelll","13 October 2021","This show built up so well over ten episodes to an absolutely gripping season finale. While the special effects weren't great, the plot, acting and characters were incredible. I really hope this gets renewed!",NA
"jmccullough-69109","15 July 2021","So glad I watched this. It's not my normal kinda thing but it flipping brilliant. So different to anything else out at the minute . Really well cast, too. There had better be a season 2!! Definitely, definitely worth watching. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",NA
"chrisrohdah","28 December 2020","The whole series feels pretty much as a generic B category zombie thingy and then... I do not know when but it turned out to be one of the best series in the genre.",NA
"andreapeco","22 May 2021","Show is great, not as the webtoon but still great. Some monsters are really bad makeup artists made, like a nurse with syringes on her nipples, really?! Thank God the main mosters are not like that. The only big con is the song selection, korean trap song and imagine dragons, literally, a stupid song of imagine dragon in the best moments of the series, completely destroys immersion. Probably should have gine the soundtrack selection to someone else.",NA
"timmons00","9 January 2021","A novel take on the zombie apocalypse genre where the 'zombies' have superpowers. The star of the show is the set design and cinematography as it really brings you in to the show's world.I do wish the show had explored some deeper themes that were ripe for the taking. The 'curse' is brought on by human desire, but how and why?Acting is generally good even as the characters are mostly one dimensional. Character depth is mostly attempted via flashbacks and death scenes. Editing is choppy and it can be hard to figure out what's going on at times.Nevertheless Sweet Home is worth the watch. Hoping that Netflix produces a season 2.",NA
"waltercarlucci","28 January 2021","The episode Im currently watching is full of asian steriotypes roles and catch phrases. Storyline... welll will see If one will apear. it feels like more like a computer game, but most computer games have a deeper story... Up to now not impressed...",NA
