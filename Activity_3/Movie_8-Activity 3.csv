"hitchcockthelegend","6 August 2014","Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.I didn't know man could build such things.Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10","

"mahmus","11 October 2020","Gladiator is the best bread and circus. A moving and very entertaining action epic with Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix at the top of their game.I absolutely love Joaquin Phoenix in this movie. He's the kind of villain you love to hate. So pathetic and childish. So ruthless and creepy. Just right amount of cartoonish. I wanted to punch him in the face.It can be corny and it drags a bit during the escape plan part of the plot, but it has enough emotion and brutal violence to keep the audience entertained, and that's what a good gladiator match should be.","

"david-meldrum","21 August 2020","20 years on, the first DVD I bought is still a barnstorming, thrilling ride. There's so much to recommend this - Lisa Gerrard & Hans Zimmer's iconic score, the canny casting of Joaquin Phoenix as a foil for Crowe; the realisation that I quote this film in everyday conversation far more than I thought I did. If it should have won the Oscars is a moot point - this is another of Ridley Scott's superb worldbuilding - one of his primary film-making skills, giving us a Rome that feels recognisable yet still a break from the cliché's that had seeped in to popular culture before this. That the film's status was boosted by the DVD boom as it made its way to home release is undeniable, but this remains a film that thrills, absorbs and grips.","

"Sleepin_Dragon","12 March 2022","One of the best films of a generation, it's a bold claim, but Gladiator truly is that good. Every single element is perfect, the story is phenomenal, one to absorb you for the full running time. The visuals are incredible, an epic masterpiece for the eyes as well as the soul. The acting first rate, surely the aim of any film is to move you, this does just that and then some.The best of Russell Crow are far as I'm concerned, he really does command the screen throughout, Joaquin Phoenix is just as good, it makes me so sad that this was the last film of the late great Oliver Reed, and of course he's awesome.I must also comment on the incredible soundtrack, the sublime music of Has Zimmer coupled with the ancient, enchanting voice of Lisa Gerrard, the music is the same glorious standard as the film, Now we are free still gives me chills, and takes me back to the film.One of my top ten films of all time, a masterpiece, 10/10.","

"Iam-Not-In-Danger-Iam-The-Danger","24 February 2020","Gladiator is a historical epic from director Ridley Scott. After being betrayed by the new Caesar, Roman general Maximus is sold into slavery as a gladiator where he rises to fame as a people's champion and finds an opportunity to exact his revenge. Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Connie Nielsen lead the cast and deliver strong performances. Additionally, the gladiator fights are especially dynamic and exciting, featuring several different styles of combat. The costumes and sets are also remarkably well-done, and create a vivid depiction of ancient Rome. And, Hans Zimmer's score does an excellent job at capturing the tone of the film. Thrilling and action-packed, Gladiator delivers a compelling tale. ""Are you not entertained?!""","

"TheLittleSongbird","15 May 2009","Ridley Scott rarely disappoints with his films. All of them, including the unjustly-maligned Legend, are visually stunning and just show the director's artistic genius. Gladiator should be up there as one of the best films he's done, if not the best. Almost everything on screen is very graphic, making some scenes upsetting to watch, but the visuals are just outstanding. The music score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the drama that is already there in the script. which is well written and rather Shakespearean. The performances were brilliant, especially Joaquin Pheonix and Oliver Reed. Russell Crowe is wholly convincing in the title role, and Richard Harris and Connie Nielson are also excellent. The costumes are brilliant, as well as the sets. In conclusion, Gladiator is a near masterpiece, only marred by some upsetting scenes. 9/10 Bethany Cox.","

"jaredpahl","9 July 2017","Gladiator, 2000's Best Picture winner, was undoubtedly one of the biggest successes of the decade. It made tons of box-office cash, nearly swept the Oscars, and revitalized the sword-and-sandals genre for years to come. Does the movie warrant the massive success it received? For the most part, yes. Ridley Scott's Roman blockbuster doesn't have quite the overwhelming emotion of another Oscar-winning epic, Braveheart, but as a brawny action spectacle, Gladiator soars. With a strong story, a profound sense of character, and action and special effects that are suitably exciting, Gladiator is a special kind of sword-and-sandals picture; One with a true dramatic core.Like the great epics of Hollywood's past, Gladiator is simple in its story. Russell Crowe stars as the Roman General, Maximus, whose life is thrown into chaos after the jealous Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) arranges for his execution. Maximus is sold into slavery where he meets Proximo, a former gladiator played by Oliver Reed who shepherds him through life as a gladiator as Commodus scrambles to stop Maximus' influence among the people. The story of Gladiator is a rock-solid tale of revenge, bolstered by well written characters, some sly political subtext, and a couple of stellar performances from Crowe and Phoenix. The two principle characters, Maximus and Commodus, are what separates Gladiator from the slew of sword-and-sandals epics that came after it. They are simply but elegantly written as characters; Maximus, a man singularly driven by a need to return to his family, Commodus, a confused young man singularly driven by a need to be loved. However, it is the performances from Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix that really elevate this material. Phoenix gives a brilliant portrait of an emotionally frustrated young man. He is completely unpredictable, but he never becomes campy. He is a real person with real problems, and there is an underlying sadness to his character that makes him so much more interesting than your typical stock villain. As for Crowe, his performance is all about physical presence. Apart from a few big emotional scenes, Crowe's performance is one of quiet masculine stoicism. He adds a remarkable gravitas to this character that all but makes the movie. You feel for him, you relate to him, you root for him, and you become inspired by him. It is a perfect heroic performance. The character stuff in Gladiator really works. Coming from a genre that made do with archetypal characters doing obligatory British accents for years, it is nothing short of a revelation that Gladiator is such a fulfilling dramatic experience. Here are characters you actually care about and not simply placeholders to string up the plot in between action scenes.When it comes to general filmmaking, Gladiator is rarely pedestrian and often astounding. Apart from some strange quirks in the filmmaking like the seemingly digitized zooms or the moments when the frame rate seems to cause a weird flicker effect, Gladiator is a deep, rich, and meticulously detailed visual experience. Hollywood production values don't get much higher than this. The technical departments are tops in terms of production design and costuming. The movie looks expensive, but there is something else in Gladiator's visual style that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. The look of the film, with its mix of traditional, large- scale sets and CG enhancements, is almost dreamlike. The environments of Ridley Scott's version of ancient Rome, including a painstakingly crafted digital recreation of the famous Colosseum, seem untethered to any kind of physical reality. It's as if what Scott has created is an environment that reflects the feeling of Ancient Rome rather than the reality of it. Just as with the deep characters and eloquent script, there's a modern feeling to Ridley Scott's filmmaking in Gladiator. The reliance on CGI is sometimes overdone, but in conjunction with the costumes, sets, and impressively grandiose score from Hans Zimmer, it adds to the intoxicating atmosphere of Ridley Scott's world.The main attraction of Gladiator is its scenes of gladiatorial combat, and on that front, Ridley Scott aptly gets the job done. There are a few moments when Scott falls back on to standard sword clashing and disorientating shaky cam, but for the most part, the action scenes are exciting, bloody, and imaginatively staged. The best action scenes are the opening Barbarian battle and a fantastic fight scene between Maximus, a veteran gladiator, and a Colosseum full of bloodthirsty tigers. In those scenes, Scott's emphasis on close-up, sweaty, brutal action is totally effective. I felt the cold of the forest mud, the heat of the flaming trees, the sharpness of the swords, and the dusty claustrophobia of the Arena. The action of Gladiator is visceral and bloody, and there is plenty of it. Those hungry for bloodsport will find more than enough manly derring-do to satiate their red-blooded desire.For all its dramatic depth, I can't say I came out of Gladiator heavily affected by feeling. This is still, at its core, a visceral experience, but the small character moments and the textured performances are miraculously riveting. I was intrigued by every second of Gladiator. The action scenes are thrilling, the dramatic scenes are mesmerizing, and the $103 million budget is all up there on the screen in every frame. Ridley Scott's direction is superlative, especially in the third act, as the story, action, and emotions reach a fever pitch. The last few scenes, including the climactic final showdown and the closing 'Elysium' scene, exhibit a crescendo of the kind of daring artistry that permeates the film's best sections. Gladiator is a meaty Hollywood epic of the best kind. It's visually sumptuous and supremely thrilling, but there is a beating heart within this beast. Sure there are a couple of bumps along the way, but with Crowe as the sturdy hero and a simple story of returning home, Gladiator stays with you long after the credits roll.92/100","

"ccthemovieman-1","1 November 2006","An intense Roman epic, a la ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Spartacus,"" it was nice to see something like this made again. It had been since the 1960s that we had seen a 3-hour extravaganza like this.Like Ben-Hur, this is a story of a successful man who loses everything thanks to an evil man, and then has to fight his way back up to seek revenge on that man and to obtain his freedom back. It's a tried-and-true formula. This movie doesn't go to excess on the violence as some of the other more recent epic films did, such as ""Braveheart"" or ""The Patriot.""The acting is excellent, beginning with Russell Crowe, who has established himself as one of the best actors of today. Joaquin Phoenix also put himself ""on the map"" as an actor with his portrayal of the evil ""Commodus."" He's so annoying you want to slap that sucker, which means he's doing a good job acting. Kudos to the rest of the cast, too.Too bad they don't make more of these type of films, as they did in the 1950s and 1960s.","

"Leofwine_draca","22 July 2016","An epic, awe-inspiring movie which thankfully shows us that Hollywood hasn't forgotten how to make good movies anymore, this is a film which has it all, from intrigue to suspense to violence to subtle romance. Forget any of the other CGI-laden rubbish filling out the multiplexes, this is a film which simply has to be seen at the cinema - or alternatively on a very big television screen indeed. Due to the fact that this film was hyped up incredibly, it doesn't actually live up to the hype, but nothing could have done. GLADIATOR is pure, old-fashioned escapism, nothing less.For once, the acting is totally flawless. Russell Crowe comes out of nowhere to give us a powerful, sensitive action hero, able to emote without the use of dialogue, delivering his lines when needed with a gruff British accent. Crowe is a revelation here - I hated him in VIRTUOSITY, but his acting is excellent and finely judged, right up there with the brooding intensity of De Niro or Pacino. He is well supported by a varied cast, including Connie Nielsen who makes a very sultry and alluring love interest. Joaquin Phoenix makes his snivelling, whining emperor truly despicable, easily soaking up the entire audience's hatred. Oliver Reed is also very good in what was to be his final role, as the proud but friendly slave owner who becomes Maximus' friend. Richard Harris lends an air of nobility and authenticity in his brief role as the dying emperor Caesar, while noted British actors Derek Jacobi and David Hemmings appear as senators.Okay, so the plot of revenge is a fairly clichéd one and the plot here is reminiscent of a whole number of other films, as well as MACBETH, but it is given added power and resonance by the great acting. The music score is also absolutely excellent and really adds to this film's atmosphere. Physically, it is beautifully made and extremely realistic - you constantly feel that you're in Rome itself. Everything is epic and the whole film is chock-full of grandeur. It looks lovely, it sounds lovely, hell, it is lovely.Director Ridley Scott doesn't skimp on the gore front either, leaving in some gruesome shots of people being cut in half, being decapitated and blood spraying in the air and all over the place. The battle scenes are the highlight of the film and are filmed in a weird way - sometimes sped up, sometimes slowed down - which make them so realistic that you do feel like you're there. They're also very exciting, with Crowe taking on ferocious tigers, masked hulking warriors, and chariots too. The twists and turns in the plot are unexpected and there's a moving, poignant ending giving this film an extra element. Old-fashioned, well-crafted and truly splendid - any movie fan owes it to themselves to see this film.","

"uds3","30 May 2002","It saddens me that a man such as Ridley Scott can work for months on location bringing the most perceptive and detailed vision of ancient Rome to absolute reality, only to incur the inappropriate, juvenile and one dimensional comments such that I have read here - the following few ""reviews"" (and I use the term 'loosely') especially. Comments such as ""horrible movie,""  ""no interesting characters,"" ""bad acting"" and my personal favorite, ""crappy special effects,"" is a sad epitaph to the lack of awareness and utter stupidity of so many viewers.GLADIATOR is one of the finest movies ever made, I don't ""think"" it, I am telling you! Ridley Scott pulled off a jaw-dropping miracle reeling the finished product in at just on $60 million. It has the appearance, continuity and professional veneer of a $300 million production. It is in fact only an adaptation on Samuel Bronston's classic 1964 movie THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, itself the most literate and well-acted epic of the 50's and 60's...and again, the key figure of Marcus Aurelius is handled with such dignity, feeling and intelligence. In 1964 Sir Alec Guinness played Aurelius as a strong and clear-thinking man of moral strength and fortitude. In GLADIATOR, Richard Harris hands in what I consider his best role ever, portraying Aurelius as a political visionary, caring parent and incorruptible leader. Excellent though Russell Crowe is here, it is Ridley Scott makes the film what it is, together with the cinematography and enervating musical score. Russell has actually not that great a dialog overload! In the acting department, Phoenix blows him off the screen as the immoral, aggrieved and ultimately weak emperor in waiting. Oliver Reed as Proximo? Well, how he did not win best supporting actor posthumously I will never know. This is the greatest Oscar scandal in history as far as I am concerned. It was the role of his life and he took it in both hands and wrung his life out into the part....completely it would seem. He died as he would have wished, tanked and slipping off a bar stool in Malta towards the end of filming. But he gave us an unforgettable Proximo and I will long honor his name with the memory of what he did here.Crappy special effects huh?  Well, in the film I saw - I was looking at the COLOSSEUM, not a special effect. I was there with them. I have never seen any CGI effect come close to what these techos achieved. Can you believe there were no more than 48 people ever on set? The ""crowds"" were made up of the same 48 people wearing different clothes and ""matted"" together - you want to tell me it ""looked"" like that? The arena action certainly was a far cry from the ""Chariot Race"" in BEN HUR but there again, what isn't? It was still exciting stuff though, well for the vaguely cerebral set I hasten to add.A film like GLADIATOR comes along probably once every 40 years or so. Its a pity so many didn't notice it THIS time around. Still, you are probably outnumbered three to one.","

"shoktart","19 February 2001","Great Story!  Great Writing!  Great Acting!  Great Directing!  Great Score! This movie has it all.  I especially enjoyed the mood of the film.  Even though it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style.  The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations.  Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the ""general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor.""  Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus.  Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine.  It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla.  However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles.  Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers.  Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo, the trainer for the gladiators.  The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the ""thrill of the Coliseum"" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate.  The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene.  But the whole movie is a rush!  Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie.  Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing.  I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages.  Next to Braveheart, this movie is the greatest of all-time!","

"ravenclaw_girlrules","11 December 2020","Rewatched this movie today. I am convinced it is the most perfect movie ever made. It has a strong female character, positive and realistic minority rep (the Roman Empire extended into Africa and I think lots of people forget that), and a compelling revenge plot. Every line moves the plot forward and is memorable. The music is gorgeous. The acting is impeccable. The visuals are absolutely stunning - especially the rose petals raining down as the emperor is ascending on the platform. The visual of the emperor dead in the colosseum while the crowd lifts Maximus away. The whole concept of Elysium makes me cry every time. The ending couldn't have wrapped everything up better.","

"RayCharles81","9 December 2023","I love when you haven't seen a great movie in five years and then happen to stumble on it on the perfect night to revisit it, somewhat forgetting much of it, or at least the affecting impact it can have on you. That was me with Gladiator recently.Most has already been said, so I want to just zoom in on a couple or parts and features. Before I do, it's a great and rarely acknowledged fact that although most of the story is fictionalized, in reality, Commodus was really infatuated with the Gladiator games; he also did indeed compete and corruptly fabricated his win-loss record. Outside of the Coliseum arena, he had a statue of himself enshrined that listed his record at something like 60 wins and no losses. However, he could rig any match he wanted and most historical accounts dispute he fought on that many matches- he may have been in a dozen or so, but doubtfully was he in that many. Also, while it would be cool if, like in the film, another gladiator fought him like that in the ring, in reality, it was Commodus' trainer that was supposedly responsible for his demise. This is interesting because while many of the story components are inaccurate, one might assume that Commodus' character was completely made up also, but he truly was a big fan and even competitor in the games.The staging of the scenery and background construction of Rome is absolutely brilliant and breathtaking. It makes you really feel like you're there in many scenes. How many movies can transport you back to experience legendary Rome two thousand years ago?Even more so brilliant is how not much has changed. Sure, our athletes don't fight to the death and now get paid sufficiently, but the relation and comparison to modern day sports events is vividly shown. The same is true for the politics- yeah, it's all in there in there. While the political components are not a deep dive, the film touches on enough philosophies and strategic realities to go a little and just enough beyond the surface to paint the picture that little has changed. There's corruption, schmoozing, contempt, grandstanding, loyalties, and nepotism.Phoenix is so entertaining to watch playing the sick, twisted, power hungry, bloodlusting emporer, especially when he's enjoying the battle of Carthage. He is truly outstanding in this role, arguably missing out on an early career, deserved Oscar award. While many of his scenes are disturbing, he is always riveting.This is a movie you will lose yourself in.The Battle of Carthage is truly awesome. This was a very elaborate and complex sequence with lots of moving parts, showing that director Scott wasn't just phoning it in. When the chariot crashes through the gate, you really feel the tides turn, like this isn't what Commodus and his organizers expected. Cutting back and forth to Commodus' reactions was a great decision and likewise with all the senators' and Connie Nielson's. That was my favorite match.My second favorite match was Tigris. What a spectacle it was having the tigers pop out from underground, and Commodus' disappointment again having thought he rigged Maximus' demise was again a great revelation.Every scene is well acted, even the behind the action scenes with Commodus and his sulister, Gracchus, and Proximo and Maximus.It's truly a classic and awesome film experience. Ridley Scott must have had a ""no bull----"" rule while making the movie because it really doesn't waste a second and with sequences like Carthage battle going right into the Commodus-Maximus confrontation, and then how quickly the film goes from battle to battle, it just feels like a filmmaker who is not screwing around. I think this has to be appreciated much more, as we know so many movies today waste time and meander.My only complaint was that we didn't get to see the promised, would-be invasion of Rome with Maximus escaping and returning with his five thousand soldiers. That would have been epic beyond epic. Instead, we get a good showdown. But to its credit, I'll give it this: Maximus at least kept half of his promise, and the end result was much the same since Commodus could no longer rule and the sister and Gracchus honored Aurelias' final wish (no invasion necessary in that regard, still I would've liked the action and suspense more).Even though many try to criticize the scripts simplicity, I disagree and find the dialogue and monologues to be quality drama and somewhat Shakespearean at times. Even the weaker scenes that were probably added are just drowned out in the action and serve their purpose to keep the audience informed.And make no mistake here: this is a visual movie, and there is much more said and conveyed in the close ups of the facial expressions of the main characters, from evil glances, to vengeful scowls, to shaking jaws, tearful eyes, frightened faces, mad bloodlusting tongue stick outs, and hopeful daydream-like optimistic smiles.We all know what's going on here, witnessing humanity at its' corrupted, animalistic worst and heroic, godly, and noble best. The end result is a masterpiece of visual, visceral spectacle and drama about one man's fall and rise by honor and heroism and another's rise and fall by corruption and cowardice, in front of the backdrop of one of the seven great wonders of the world. It doesn't get much more epic than this these days!I hope my review is merciful and you are all entertained!","

"moondoggy88","6 March 2002","I borrowed this movie on DVD, but I wish I had seen it in the theater for it would have been a lot more fun and powerful there. Despite this, Gladiator is one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen. The plot goes so smooth together, as well as the acting and the terrific musical score. Director Ridley Scott puts all effort into making this film an epic, and he does just that. I'd have to say that anyone who likes Ridley Scott (I sure do) should see this. It is a lot like Ridley's other movies (Black Hawk Down was also amazing). If you can stand a little bit--well, ok a LOT of blood and gore, then you should see this. Russell Crowe shows an excellent performance like no other. I don't think there's one bad movie that Ridley Scott has made or that Russell Crowe has acted in. The fact that the brutal battles involving innocent slaves in this film actually happened in real life centuries ago makes it even more interesting and powerful. Emperor Commodus is a truely evil and life-like villian who shows a lot of his wits in attempts to get his revenge against Maximus.Ridley Scott went to many different locations to shoot this film to make it real, and he does. The film is set in Rome, and it looks just like it. You feel as if you are there in the crowd, hearing them cheer and cheer to see the death. To some of you, this may sound a little barbaric, and believe me the film is VERY barbaric and brutual, however it teaches a very strong lesson of what happens when an economy turns as violent as Rome was. Ridley Scott goes to many lengths to make this movie real, because even though the characters are fictitious, all of this really did happen. Innocent people had to go through brutual fighting while thousands of people cheered for either their death or the enemy's death. If you were an inexperienced fighter, chances are you would get killed. But the strange thing is that Rome LOVED this. People came from all over to see these fights and to see the blood that was shed, that is why you can't blame the characters in this film for being so forlorn and saddened the whole time. The film itself is very dark. The theme is dark and the ending is dark. From beginning to end there is excessive violence (for those action movie-goers, this is a movie for you). But if the violence is concerning you, don't let it. The special effects make the movie great, but it's the acting and storyline that make it spectacular. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED for anyone who wants a good time. Definitely makes you think. ***** out of *****.","

"Russell_","12 September 2005","""Gladiator"" definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple, but moving, story with beautiful scenery, filming, direction and score  it is truly a ""complete"" movie.I am mostly compelled with the beautiful script which in a way reminds me of poetry, though it is still everyday language. I love the acting portrayed by the late Oliver Reed and also Richard Harris. Russell Crowe, Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less ""popular"" artists who also deserve a big ""bravo"". Amongst them I have to mention ex-Mr Universe Ralph Moeller who is mostly used as the comic relief of the movie. In Gladiator we can also the beautiful and popular Maltese TV Star and actress Ruth Frendo, who although has a small part, she is totally brilliant and outstanding.Actually I got to IMDb while I was looking for her name on the internet, in fact on IMDb she has some very stunning photos. I was lucky to meet Ruth Frendo whilst she was filming in another Maltese production. Ruth Frendo is not only a gorgeous and talented actress but she is also amazingly intelligent and very down-to-earth. We will definitely be seeing more of her work in the future... The scenery used for ""Gladiator"" is brilliant  and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie; and I love the light contrasts thanks to the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal feel to the entire movie.""Gladiator"" deserves all the awards and great reviews it has received, and for those of you who still haven't gone and watched it  I can assure you that it will be well worth your time and money. So go on and rent it now!","

"paulyb","2 May 2000","The epic blockbuster returns with the 21st Century's answer to Cecil B DeMille, Ridley Scott and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge, GLADIATOR - ""the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor"".Once a great roman General, and as good as adopted son of Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Harris), Maximus (Crowe) is forced into exile by Commodus (Phoenix), heir to the throne, after the death of Marcus. Saved from death by slavers, he is purchased for use as a gladiator by Proximo (Reed) and ends up in the arena of all arena's, the Colloseum, where he proves unbeatable under his guise as ""The Spaniard"".And with a budget of over $100m, Scott certainly delivers the goods. GLADIATOR transcends the notion of 'blockbuster' that we have become accustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and instead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus and and Ben Hur. Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that contains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss, courage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc etc) - also on offer is a visual feast of cinematic painting after painting - a rich tapestry of images that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the plains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to great Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended highly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film. The opening  battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the screen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays incredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way, Scott has created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings (and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky depths of film history where they belong.The cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the task with a great emotional range and depth of character. His accent ocassionally bugged me (as did the mish mash of accents on offer - but that is I guess a legacy of 'internationally casted films'), but this aside, he was well and truly up to the task. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus, as is Nielson as Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus who ""should have been a son"" and finds herself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is 'right'. The old guard thesps of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong as supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job as the young heir to the throne.Add to this great cast excellent editing and post production work, and an intricate soundscape (including a magnificent Hans Zimmer score), and you have a film that, despite its length, was highly palatable and had me in there from beginning to end. A must see.","

"angelo-29","6 June 2000","Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world. Well, you should see for yourself!","

"drqshadow-reviews","21 July 2020","A number of giant, career-making performances (plus another impressive turn in the director's chair for Ridley Scott) fuel this rich, hard-hitting saga of betrayal, grief and revenge in imperial Rome. The dueling fates of Maximus (Russell Crowe) and Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) share the front and center, twin note-perfect parts that continuously clash over the spotlight, but dozens of supporting players also deserve recognition. Richard Harris as the guilt-ridden sage, Marcus Aurelius. Oliver Reed chewing scenery as a grizzled, cynical combatant-turned-slaver. Djimon Hounsou and Ralf Moeller, comrades in arms who convey an intimate, crucial sense of kinship. As an intensely emotion-driven story, Gladiator can't function without this level of acting power. In less capable hands, it might be laughed off the screen. With Crowe, Phoenix and company in command - and, again, Scott there to expertly piece it all together amid an appropriately epic score by Hans Zimmer - we're swept off our feet.It's an enveloping film; a thick flood of sights, sounds and moods. We marvel over the bustling Roman Colosseum, tense our muscles in the raging chaos of battle, find peace in the metaphor of golden wheat fields as an afterlife. Maximus's justified outrage becomes our own, Commodus (with his barely-contained mania) our bane, and once it's got those hooks in, the script doesn't give an inch. An exceptionally powerful production, damn near perfect in all respects.","

"gregatory","3 May 2000","Most films require that the viewer identifies with the character to truly be engrossed with the film. If you can't feel something for the character, than the audience is lost.Luckily, in Ridley Scott's case, Russel Crowe is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors today, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders.Not to say that he is the only reason this works. The supporting cast, most notably Connie Neilsen, buoy the film to new perspectives.Jacquin Phoenix definitely captures the egotisitcal persona he should display, stealing every scene he's in. Phoenix will surely be put on the map with Gladiator.But the real shining star in this film are the incredible action sequences which jolt the viewer right in with the opening sequences, as Maximus' true worth to the Roman Empire is displayed. Scott's camera work within these completed sequences takes a modern twist that really works for the gruesome scenes.Crowe will now get the respect he deserves for this collosal performance. Gladiator makes the most of its 2 and a half hours, marking a triumphant comeback for the long forgotten epics of the classic days of film. ALL HAIL MAXIMUS!","

"bkoganbing","4 October 2020","35 years after Samuel Bronston and Anthony Mann gave us The Fall Of The Roman Empire, Ridley Scott told the same tale of the Emperor Commodus and
his problems succeeding his legendary father, Emperor/philosopher Marcus Aurelius. Neither film got the story right, both have him killing his father and
both have him with a hero/rival. In the Mann film it's Stephen Boyd in this film it is Russell Crowe. Both have a sister working against him Sophia Loren in the
Mann film and in the Ridley Scott film Connie Nielsen.Although I loved Christopher Plummer in The Fall Of The Roman Empire, truth be told Joaquin Phoenix is closer to the real Commodus. Commodus was only a teen when he became Emperor in 180 AD and reigned a lot longer than it seemed in Gladiator. In real life he was strangled by a wrestler who was part of a conspiracy. He did in fact love the Coliseum and did like to participate occasionally as is shown in both films.In this film when Joaquin Phoenix learns that Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius plans to name Russell Crowe one of his best fighting generals as his successor he kills Harris and Crowe's family. Crowe is sold off in bondage, but works his way back to Rome to take Phoenix down.Gladiator marks he farewell film of Oliver Reed who plays the head of the gladiator school who trains Crowe. Derek Jacobi plays a senator and as he did
in I Claudius dreams of reestablishing the republic.Gladiator won for Best Picture and Best Actor for Russell Crowe and also won for costume design, special effects, and best sound. Sharp film fans will see
bits of both Ben-Hur and Spartacus woven into the story.Gladiator is a well put together drama and Crowe and Phoenix have quite an acting duel. Maybe the real Commodus story will get a film one day. Until then Gladiator and The Fall Of The Roman Empire will do nicely.","

"sddavis63","24 March 2002","The beginning of ""Gladiator"" is powerful. We see the Roman Legion fighting against the Germanic tribes in what surely must be one of the most spectacular battle scenes ever filmed; one which truly does give the viewer a taste of what warfare in that era must have been like. The ending is powerful, as the quest for vengeance finally comes to a head, with General Maximus facing the Emperor Commodus in a gladiatorial contest in the Roman arena. In between - well - things could have been a little better.The acting in this movie, I thought, was first-rate. Russell Crowe as General Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix as Emperor Commodus and Connie Nielsen as Lucilla, sister of Commodus, all played their parts perfectly. The gladiatorial bouts were superbly choreographed. The set decoration was magnificent, and looked exactly as I would expect Imperial Rome to have looked. So, why do I say this could have been better?(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Basically, the whole thing was just a bit too clear-cut for me. Maximus was too obviously the good guy, Commodus too obviously the bad guy. With this being so clear, we know that the movie must be heading for the final confrontation between the two, and it makes watching the middle 90 minutes or so difficult. ""Get on with it,"" I found myself thinking from time to time. It didn't have to be quite so clear cut. The potential was there to give the viewer a real ethical choice to make. I mean, one can understand Commodus being angry when Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) - his father - takes away the throne that Commodus had believed all his life would be his, and hands control of Rome over to Maximus. Commodus could have been a sympathetic character. He didn't have to murder his father. His father was elderly; a natural death wouldn't have been out of the question. And why the incestuous fascination with Lucilla? I didn't think it added anything to the movie - except to make Commodus even more repulsive. In the end, the movie didn't make me think about anything; it didn't challenge me with any moral decision-making; it didn't make choosing sides in this battle even remotely difficult.Don't get me wrong. This was a very good movie. One can always argue whether this movie or that should have been named best picture; one certainly has to agree that ""Gladiator"" was worthy of consideration. I just felt it could have been better. In the end, I give it a rating of 7/10.","

"copperccso","7 September 2002","I love history, and to me, Gladiator is a masterpiece. It is the most accurate picture of the Roman Empire Hollywood has ever put out.  People declare Spartacus a masterpiece, but Gladiator far outdoes Spartacus in quality.  The costuming, the acting, the screenplay, the scenery, and the fighting styles made me think that I had traveled back to 180 A.D. Russell Crowe is a true Hollywood tough guy, and he is superb in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as a villain, one of the best in movie history.  He played his character as if it were a psychologist's dream case. Connie Nielsen plays one of the strongest female characters that I have ever seen.  The choreographer of the action sequences was brilliant. Ridley Scott did an outstanding job in recreating the Empire, including the multitude of ethnic groups within the Empire and accurately depicting everyday life.  If you're looking for insight into what the Roman Empire was like, this is a perfect depiction.","

"john-collie-1","9 July 2023","In an age where CGI often overshadows storytelling, Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000) is a breath of fresh cinematic air. This historical epic, set in a tumultuous era of the Roman Empire, is a masterclass in filmmaking, showcasing an amalgamation of riveting performances, stunning visuals, and a score that stirs the soul.At the heart of Gladiator is Maximus Decimus Meridius, played with steely determination and compelling vulnerability by Russell Crowe. Crowe's performance is a spectacular tour de force, embodying a man whose honor, family, and freedom are taken from him. The depth of his character arc - from respected Roman general to enslaved gladiator, from broken man to symbol of hope - is beautifully depicted, earning Crowe a well-deserved Oscar.Opposite Crowe is Joaquin Phoenix as the power-hungry, emotionally unstable Emperor Commodus. Phoenix masterfully portrays a character that we love to hate, providing a worthy adversary for Crowe's Maximus. The scenes between the two are electric, the tension palpable.Visually, Gladiator is a spectacle to behold. The depiction of ancient Rome, from its grand coliseums to its war-torn battlefields, is rendered with incredible detail and authenticity. The gladiatorial combats are raw and thrilling, capturing the brutality and excitement of the Roman games. Scott doesn't shy away from the violence, but rather uses it to underline the brutality of the era and the courage of those who dared to defy it.Yet, it is the film's memorable score by Hans Zimmer that elevates Gladiator to an exceptional cinematic experience. From the melancholic ""Now We Are Free"" to the stirring ""Battle,"" Zimmer's soundtrack resonates, amplifying the emotion and gravitas of the narrative.The screenplay, too, deserves praise. Packed with memorable lines - ""What we do in life echoes in eternity,"" - it's a script that complements the grandeur of the film's visuals and performances.Gladiator is more than a movie; it's an experience. A return to the golden age of epic filmmaking, it provides an emotional depth often lacking in blockbuster fare. It's a tale of vengeance and redemption, of the struggle against tyranny, and of the resilience of the human spirit. Two decades on, its impact remains undiminished, solidifying its position as one of the most compelling films of the 21st century.","

"Mr_PCM","7 December 2005","If only Peter Jackson hadn't come along and done a rather good trilogy of films, we might possibly be talking about the greatest film of the 21st Century so far. Its sweeping but simplistic heroic tale, crunching fight scenes, award-winning special effects, towering acting and soaring score set this film apart from all the pretenders that followed it. Ridley Scott single-handedly re-invented the epic genre with this story of a Roman solider who is betrayed, loses everything and is sold into slavery, only to fight his way back as a gladiator, all the while driven by vengeance for his murdered family.Russell Crowe gives quite simply the performance of a lifetime as the Gladiator Maximus, one that deservedly won him Best Actor at the 2000 Academy Awards (although his performance in the following year's Beautiful Mind was arguably even better, even if it didn't win him his second consecutive Oscar), and provided a thinking woman's alternative to the likes of Pitt, Cruise and Clooney to swoon over. His gravely voice and impressive physique combine to give him a huge presence, which literally fills the screen. His dialogue is sparing, but his actions speak far louder, adding a stoic sadness to his vengeance-driven heroic character. Before Gladiator, Crowe was a good secondary actor; after Gladiator he was catapulted to the top of Hollywood's A-list, and remains there, thanks to this career-making performance proving him to be one of the finest actors of his generation.Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the scheming and corrupt Emperor Commodus who betrays Maximus and has his family killed. He manages to be delightfully and totally evil without ever descending into the realms of pantomime villain, which is a tricky line to walk, and manages to avoid being overshadowed by Crowe's monumental performance.The fight scenes are rousing and superbly choreographed, in particular a scene where Maximus marshals his fellow slaves into an army against marauding chariot archers in the Colosseum. The dialogue is kept simple and never overbearing (no need to worry why all of Europe speaks the same language) and culminates in one of the most memorable pieces of script that is destined to join the ranks of 'Play it Sam' and 'Are you talking' to me' as one of the most quoted (and misquoted) lines in movie history  although it is rather wordy. But here it is, in full; 'My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius. Commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true Emperor Marcus Aurelius; Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.' As Crowe turns to the Emperor in the arena and delivers this line, it proves to be one of the most electrifying moments in cinema history  hairs will stand up, spines will tingle, guaranteed.The action is set to some truly beautiful music, and it is shameful Hans Zimmer missed out on the Oscar for Best Score. Ridley Scott was similarly unlucky in the Director category.The film is however tinged with sadness, as it proved to be the final (but triumphant) swansong for the careers of Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, both of whom died shortly after making this film. Neither could have delivered much finer performances, and if any performance had to be a final one, both delivered one worthy of such a status here. Reed in particular is a revelation, reminding older generations and showing a new generation of his considerable talent.An inspiring film, rousing, exhilarating, exciting and moving. Superbly acted, directed, scored and visualised. A tribute to how great films could be once, and could be again.","

Scott's ""Gladiator"" is build around a mythic character, a man trying to find his way home... It is around someone finding inner strength in a tough time Maximus is somebody who doesn't want to be a soldier We realize this is a man who is pursuing the ultimate which is transcending death and finding love after death which completely transforms your reaction to the man, a man who is very, very strong but very, very loving The plot, familiar from Anthony Mann's "" Fall of the Roman Empire,"" had Crowe as Maximus, the proud well-loved Roman general in the army of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Maximus whose motto is 'Strength and Honor' is like a son to Aurelius, a statement that left Aurelius' own son, Commodus perturbed...Disappointed by the news that his father privately decides to name Maximus his successor, and being a young ambitious son lusting for power, he murders his father, and orders a strike against the general... One of the best scenes of the motion picture is where Commodus is told by his father that he is not going to be the emperor Joaquin Phoenix is easy to hate in a frightening and vile character...Ridley Scott creates a lot of beautiful scenes between the characters He did some fantastic work in all of those wonderful scenes in the film But there's another moment between the emperor and his daughter Lucilla (the Danish beauty Connie Nielsen) that I loved very much Harris says, ""Let's not speak of politics. Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter and I'm a good father. "" They walk for a few seconds and Lucilla says, ""This is a pleasant fiction."" I felt this short scene so sophisticated It seemed to me wonderfully insightful, simple in terms of amount of words, but complex in terms of understanding this strange relationship One of the most successful bits of casting was Oliver Reed He's a harsh and rough businessman who makes his living off the death machine and yet, inside, there was some kind of ethical person that would come out at the right momentRidley Scott's epic film does not romanticize a democratic Golden Age of Rome but a decaying, blood thirsty empire on the edge of its fall... Through its beautiful music, through Russell's performance and through Ridley's soulfulness, ""Gladiator"" brought a poetic vision in a new and very cinematically richly way that really gave the audience something different, so emotional and so intimate","

"almagz","19 November 2005","There is so little to find wanting in this film and not wanting to merely repeat its many deserved praises, all I can do is question a couple of historical points.It is unlikely that a Roman general would be sold into slavery and forced to fight in the arena. Exiled, yes. Killed maybe. Asked to commit suicide to retain his property, most likely. It is unlikely that he would return to find his family crucified, of all things. Romans were very specific about who got crucified and why. Romans usually avoided it, no matter how cruel the tyrant(?) was.Roman legionnaires would NEVER have a tattoo unless they were barbarians who got one BEFORE joining a legion. Marking or mutilating the human body was expressedly anti- Roman. No statue or depiction exists of a main-period Roman showing a body-marking. The bonding feature the writer was attempting was an inappropriate borrowing from the 20th century German SS.Great entertaining movie nonetheless.","

"BenNicholson123","8 November 2005","Gladiator! A thrilling tale of a Roman general who must battle against all thinkable odds to avenge the death of his family and restore justice to the empire. The plot is simple, legendary general Maximus Decimus Meridius, after many victorious campaigns and battles wants to return to his peaceful home in Spain, However the kind, fair and dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius wishes to bestow his title on him over his cruel son, Commodus. Commodus is understandably annoyed and kills his father calming the title of Emperor. Maximus is sentenced to death along with the rest of his family back at his home in Spain. Maximus escapes but is unable to save his wife and son. His loss of will to live makes him an east target for slavers and he is soon sold as a gladiator. He fights his way into the coliseum in Rome were he wins over the crowd and uses his celebrity status to defy the Emperor, to whom he swears his vengeance for the death of his family, after many battles and political backstabbing he gets his chance to fight the Emperor in the Arena.This is just such an amazing film, it captures every emotion possible in only the way an expert director can achieve, we can go on for whole scenes without the need for speaking, everything is told through the genuine body language and expressions. And when there is conversing we get such emotion and wonderfully powerful quotes  ""What we do in life, echoes in eternity"" Wow.The opening scene is spellbinding, showing the true gore of battle, the fight scenes are marvellously realistic, discarding the popular ""pretty"" sword fighting for brutal aggressive force. The audience in the arena express every emotion, surprise, anger, and enjoyment. The cast is brilliantly chosen; we can really see Russell Crowe as a gladiator, in Commodus, Joaquin Phoenix gives us a man we can really hate, Connie Nielson shows real emotion and passion in the role of Lucilla. So apart from the spellbinding acting, scarily realistic fight scenes and the amazing script, what else can we look for? The music is just stunning, its exactly what we need brought in at exactly the right time, truly wonderful directing. And then we have the stunning special effects, we can really visualise the greatness that is Rome, the fight scenes really make you believe. Some critics have condemned the lack of historical fact, for instance an emperor would never fight a gladiator, and these comments cannot be denied, its true.But I think we can forgive them that one fault for such an amazing movie. Without hesitation I give this movie a truly deserved 10/10!","

"IcyTones","27 November 2020","A movie where the featured Black guy is 'NOT' the first to die. Djimon Hounsou who plays Juba is a rising star that has swapped his life as a Catwalk Model & appearing in music videos for an acting career. He has been acting since 1997.
Juba is 'The Spaniard's' confidant whilst both serve as slaves. Both were sold to the local entrepreneur to fight as Gladiators.That unmistakable scar & voice of Oliver Reed was a surprise to see as this movie was recommended to me for 'the chariot race' scene. Twas good to see a veteran actor in this movie. Oliver Reed was to acting what George Best was to football. I always think that whatever major or minor roles veteran actors play, their names should come up first in the credits, but sadly not everyone shares this view.Although it's not a competitive race, there is a small 'Chariot Race' in the Coliseum Arena, but it's a race to kill the band of Gladiators stuck in the middle, before they get a chance to kill the Emperors league of marauders - in the name of 'sport'.The Emperor's son didn't just 'decide' to kill his father, he had a heart felt emotional son-to-father talk with his dad, who responded equally with the same heartfelt emotions of a father who knelt before his son to kinda ask for his son's forgiveness. A father who now acknowledges that he is as much to blame for shaping Commodus's wayward character, is a moment to be treasured. It's the father who has failed his son, not the son who has disappointed his father. The Emperor extended his arms to give his son a hug, but his son Commodus overcome with grief and jealousy at hearing the news that his father's general has been appointed by his father to temporarily rule Rome, he took the opportunity of an embrace to suffocate & kill his father and declare himself the new Emperor.If you lack the courage to be yourself, this movie can only but encourage you. In today's society education is a supportive aid to have a title & letters after your name. When asked to reveal himself, Maximus gave this whole spiel of who he was. Who are you? What goes before you? How do you want to introduce or refer to yourself? These were my thoughts!","

"wideawakedreamer","4 June 2000","The movie is the story of Maximus (Crowe), a general who leads the Roman army to victory over Germania in the beginning of the movie. The dying emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius, is watching this battle.The emperor's son, Commodus, then arrives with his sister Lucilla, and it is discovered that Commodus fully expects to be announced the new emperor of Rome in a few days. Aurelius, however, has other plans--he wants to make Maximus emperor, and requests that of the general, who wants nothing more than to go home to his family.I went into this movie having just watched Ben-Hur in my film studies class and having watched an episode of Xena only a couple of weeks earlier that featured the story of Marc Anthony and Cleopatra. So you could say I was in the perfect mindset to watch a ""sword-and-sandal"" movie. I wasn't sure what to expect, having somehow avoided all the hype that accompanied this movie. But I was not disappointed.Gladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The battle scenes are very graphic. (This movie is not for the squeamish, that's for sure.) There were some scenes in particular that really struck me, such as when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast.  The use of color and color tones added a great deal to the mood of the movie. Excellent.The script was being written and re-written as the filming was going on, yet it doesn't show that the actors had no idea how the movie was going to end when they began filming.  The acting is terrific. Russell Crowe is wonderfully cast as Maximus. Many reviewers agree that he is now officially a star. Joaquin Phoenix also proves his mettle as the emotionally troubled Commodus, whose behavior and emotion toward his sister could give anyone the creeps. Connie Nielsen makes you believe that, as Lucilla, she really is torn between natural loyalty to her brother and doing what she knows is right. Oliver Reed, in his last performance, is memorable in his role of Proximo, the former gladiator who is the owner of Maximus and brings him to Rome.  In short, the actors were brilliant in their roles, not over-acting, but giving subtle, strong performances.The script itself is very good.  Although some elements are a little hard to believe--the fact that no one recognizes Maximus when he's a slave?--this film calls for a willing suspension of disbelief, which one would happily comply with.  (It's really no fun to nitpick such a movie.)It's true that this movie does pretty much follow the Braveheart formula. However, this movie includes some elements, such as the cinematography and the incredibly graphic battle scenes (one reviewer likened it to Saving Private Ryan, ""only better""), that are spectacular in itself. Overall, a great movie that I highly recommend.","

"comingaround","19 August 2000","This is wonderful storytelling.  The opening Battle Scene simply mesmerizes, showing the brutal nature of combat for Roman conquests.  I went back to see the film again.  The first time I didn't hear anything Crowe said before the battle.  I was just too visually caught-up.  The second time I listened very closely and caught the wise yet succinct line from Maximus ""what we do in life... echoes in eternity.""  Awesome.A simple man v. an emperor.  I just loved the resilience Maximus showed throughout the movie.  I find in most movies, there is an irritatingly slow process where the character has to ""find himself,"" not so with Gladiator. Maximus does what is needed.I liked how there were only two or three issues within this film.  One was the afterlife.  Aspects of the afterlife are opened, but not overdone.  Love of family is given sizable focus. I liked the theme of love of country that we see as well, although it may not be justly deserved, it is never questioned.The visual effects were amazing.  It actually had me wanting to believe that's the way Rome actually looked in all it's glory.  The battle of Carthage reenactment was really great.The ending is just hypnotic. Intentionally or unintentionally it was simply emotional.  The music is wonderfully beautiful as if Maximus' family are telling him...you have arrived.Bottom line: magnificent.  Visually and emotionally satisfying.","

"TheNabOwnzz","21 April 2019","Gladiator is not just director Ridley Scott's ultimate masterpiece ( And i am also keeping the fantastic Alien & Blade Runner in mind when i say this ), it is also undoubtedly one of the most viscerally effective and emotionally compelling of motion pictures ever made.It plays somewhat like a modern Ben-Hur, as a very respectable character is forced into slavery due to him standing up for what is right. Of course, being a much more modern epic, the editing is a lot quicker, as is the entire pace of the picture. However,with 171 minutes playtime in the extended edition, Scott doesn't haste through this picture, and takes his time to set up his characters & their respective arcs. Gladiator is however not a flawless film, as several action sequences ( Particularly in the introduction in the battle of Germania ) feature quite a lot of shaky cam and quick editing, but admittedly this is nowhere near as bad as something like Taken or The Bourne Trilogy. Most of the action sequences are superbly edited, with widescreen shots to create an overview, combined with mediums to immerse the viewer into the action. A couple of times there is a shakycam shot in the middle of this, but it's a very minor issue. Another minor fault is in some of the backdrops. The 'Am i not merciful' scene features an obvious greenscreen, saturated a bit too brightly, and Proximo is obviously not physically there near the end of the film ( When actor Oliver Reed had already died ). Again these minor issues feature only in 1 scene respectively, and therefore do not really do anything to truly diminish the cinematic power that Gladiator provides.On the whole, the cinematography & art direction of Gladiator is impeccable. It is not the best, since as stated before there are a couple of lesser backdrops easily recognizable as greenscreens, but for most of the picture the viewer is subjected to beautiful angles, backdrops & sets. The scenes in Zuccabar are an example of the seductive natural beauty Gladiator provides, and Maximus's ride to his family after his execution attempt also feature some stunning environmental shots. Sets are elegantly crafted and varied in a beautiful color palette, becoming most apparent in Commodus's & Lucilla's scenes. The titanic image of the Colosseum is also one that is difficult to get rid of, despite the fact that i believe it was filmed in full CGI, but apart from perhaps the absolute final shot ( Burying the sculptures ), that is hardly noticable.The art of acting is utilized at its finest in Gladiator, with three absolute superb performances by leads Russel Crowe as Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus & Connie Nielsen as Lucilla. Not to mention the fantastic supporting performances of legendary actor Richard Harris & Oliver Reed. Crowe is the epitome of a brick of stoic masculinity, yet he gave an utterly convincing and extended sob fest when gazing upon the sight of his crucified family, showing us his versatility as an actor. We see him win a battle against Germanians through his discipline, intelligence and courage, and we are rooting for his character from this moment forth. He is in his heart a simple man that just wants to go home to his family, but he is also honor bound to Rome, and proves this through his courageous actions. Not interested by the corruptions of power, he lives only to see justice done. Phoenix is superb as the corrupted emperor, showing us his envy of Maximus simply with one look into the eyes ( Look at Phoenix's superb facial acting in the scene where Maximus reveals himself to him in the arena ), his arrogance & his brutality. Nielsen is also quite underrated, as her disguised fear during every scene with her brother after their father's death is a stunning feat of acting within acting, culminating with her utter terror at the end when Commodus demands a 'pure blood' heir with her.Of course one cannot forget Hans Zimmer's fantastic contribution to his masterpiece, creating arguably his finest score to date, with this especially being the case during the transition between the (Again) 'Am i not merciful' scene and the shots of the arena. Obviously 'Now we are free' is also one of the most emotionally powerful scores ever created. It is also one of Zimmer's most varied scores, as a slight criticism of him is often his repeated melodies ( Admittedly, a lot of the themes in Gladiator still sound similar to The Rock, but a lot of them also do not ). In any case, it is rare to imagine the brilliance and emotional resonance of Gladiator without Zimmer's score.While the narrative is fairly straightforward as a revenge story, the dialogue written is superb, with many incredible lines such as 'What we do in life, echoes in eternity', not to mention the slow character development and character arcs, even within seemingly minor characters like Proximo & Quintus ( You will need to see the extended edition to witness Quintus's arc ) who have their original ideals challenged and overcome throughout the events in the film. Even though Maximus's sole purpose in life has become to kill Commodus in revenge for his family, it is in a way a very hopeful film. A film about standing up for what is right, and being granted redemption and a reunion with loved ones in the end. Maximus does not want to rule Rome, but in slaying Commodus, he secures the feature of it for is people, while also acquiring his personal goal. He demands respect for his valor and his morals throughout the film, and this makes sure that we as an audience are emotionally drained by the time he enters the Elysium fields, and is hailed as a hero by the people of Rome, and a hero he was.One of the all-time greats of epic motion pictures, Gladiator features impeccable acting, writing ,cinematography, art direction & a phenomenal original score. It also features possibly the most relatable main character ever written, which is partly why there are very little films that can equal the emotional power that Gladiator creates.","

"screenman","6 January 2008","Evaluating opinion of this movie by the 'Hated It' selection, I lost count of the number of contributors who gave it just one star. I thought they were being unnecessarily 'Roman' in their ruthlessness, but the result does show how disappointed so many viewers were and the extent to which this movie has polarised opinion.I diplomatically place myself somewhere in the middle.For me, scepticism set-in at the outset. That much-vaunted battle scene didn't sit right at all. In combat, the greatest Roman strength lay in the legion. The scrupulously drilled and disciplined foot-soldiers worked in unison, advancing upon enemies in their orderly units and maniples.Their Shields interlocked to create a mobile wall that could form-up on all flanks and even provide overhead protection. In between, they used their short, stabbing swords.The legions, then, were only at their best in the open. In dense forest, their advantages would have been squandered, any fight being a brawl upon the same terms as the enemy. Morover, their big Shields would have been an encumbrance and the short swords inadequate. A good Roman general drew the enemy out to fight on his terms, not the other way round. I'm not a scholar of Roman warfare; it may be there were occasions when Romans had no choice, but this is where the question marks began to pop-up. Check out the impeccable piece in 'Spartacus', where the Roman legions deploy by the textbook, drawing their enemy down from the hill. Perhaps Mr Scott felt that a more faithful rendering would seem like too much of a rip-off. In any case, this battle is quite incidental, and seems to exist only to grip the viewer's attention for the next couple of flatulent hours.Neither was I aware that the Roman army employed fire-bombs. It's not for me to say they didn't, but I have no reference to this tactic at all.I thought Ridley Scott made a futile attempt to create an 'arty' film. The frequent dream-like flashbacks to a hand running through spears of corn reminded me of the recurrent unicorn dream from his fascinating but equally pretentious 'Blade Runner'. From time to time there's even the same high-pitched warbling 'oriental' chorus, intended to project mood, but failing again. Some directors don't seem to realise that cinema-goers have memories.General Gruntus Maximus (Russel Crowe) surely got the easiest Oscar in history. He was believable as an uneducated slob in the way, perhaps, Spartacus should have been; but cerebral enough to be a general? I don't think so. And you don't rise to be a career general in an army whilst obsessing as a farmer about your harvest. You're either one, or the other.There was one particularly absurd scene in the arena when he was chopping-down competitors as quickly as they could be set against him. What then - weren't they trained gladiators, too? I was half-expecting him to begin walking sideways along the arena walls like 'Neo' from 'Matrixus'.As to the 'spectacle' of Rome; well, that was all just computer-generated hokum. The back-room boys can whip-up anything in that way now just by tapping a few keys, so what's the big deal? Check-out the 'real' thing in 'Fall Of The Roman Empire'.As with 'Titanic' and 'Pearl Harbour' a splendid opportunity was missed here to do something really wonderful, but because of flawed vision and misplaced directorial self-belief we finished up with mediocrity. Glorious mediocrity.Still, bread and circuses usually please the crowds.","

"PyroSikTh","30 August 2021","Gladiator deserves every ounce of praise it got at the time (and debatably deserved more), and still gets to this day. It's a stirring story of revenge against the backdrop of Roman glory, with a game played off between the stoicism of Maximus against the cruel envy of Commodus over the people's adoration. It becomes as much about the back-alley politicking and public perceptions as it does the fights within the arena itself. Maximus is the pinnacle of masculinity and heroism against Commodus' despicable antagonist, an underdog against powers greater than himself. And when Maximus gets his revenge and collapses on the floor to meet his wife and son in the afterlife, it hits with the emotional weight it has earned. It's beautiful to look at, gorgeous to listen to, expertly directed and edited. I give Gladiator a resounding 9/10.","

"tedg","14 May 2000","Regular readers of my comments note my penchant for pointing out that film is a modern medium, meaning that films -- good ones anyway -- are often largely about themselves. When the nature of this self-comment is interesting, I point it out. But I failed to do so in an earlier comment on Gladiator, so here is the remedy.Summer movies target the lowest of our sensibilities. The plots are highly simplified morality plays where good and evil are radically drawn; the form is of violent spectacle. In other words, our civilized society wants the same things we observe in later Rome, to which we insist on feeling superior.So the master Scott gives us a violent spectacle about a violent spectacle. He makes fun of us by pandering to our baser tastes while slyly getting us to agree with the wise senator who observes how simple, stupid and manipulable is the mob. He did much the same in Blade Runner, but there the comment was on the sharpness, complexity of the audience not its dullness.
Is this a maturing cynicism, an adventure into a new challenge (mastering the art of painting with a blunt palette), or a striking out against Hollywood's financial politics? I suppose we've have to wait a decade to find out -- until after the power-hungry Caesars die and the medium is returned to the enlightened leaders of the people.","

"planktonrules","12 February 2012","Visually, ""Gladiator"" is a masterpiece. I saw a documentary about how they made this film long before I saw the actual movie and it's amazing to see how they used CGI to construct an enormous FULL stadium even though most of it wasn't real! The costumes, props, chariots and trappings were also gorgeous--as good as anything you'll ever see in a film about ancient Rome. And, with some spectacular stunts and TONS of blood, it is brutal--but spectacularly brutal. You really have to see this film and it will knock your socks off.If you look at my summary, however, I say that the film is a bit disappointing as well. As a retired history teacher, I know that much of the history shown in this film is wildly inaccurate. It bears only a very superficial semblance to the facts and it's a shame, as the true story of Emperor Commodus would make for an exciting film. In addition, at times I felt as if the dialog was just awful. Too often, folks talks as if they were making speeches or delivering lines in a high school play. And, it turns out I am not alone. After the film, I read through the IMDb trivia and noticed that the actors ALSO hated the dialog and much of it was changed....though in my opinion, not enough of it was changed. There was often no emotion other than rage or boredom from Maximus, for example. His grief at the crucifixion of his family sounded LESS emotional than it should have--like he was upset that the commissary forgot to but cheese on his burger--not like a man grief-stricken with loss. Simply put, the human side to the film is stilted.So what you are left with is a WILDLY exciting film--a true spectacle. But it lacks the humanity and truth that would have made it even better. Still, it's well worth seeing.","

"Jetset971","14 May 2010","I have had a great deal of discussions with people about this film. I agree it is a good movie. Its entertaining, action packed, worth the price of a ticket. However, I don't think I have ever seen a movie win so many awards without questioning the validity. Gladiator, while still a good film, is hardly deserving of all its accolades. I mean it might be worthy of winning cinematography or production awards or special effects but Best picture? Best Actor? I could think of a 100 other movies in the year 2000 more deserving than this movie. Don't misunderstand, I like this movie, but the problem is that movie awards like the Oscars,presumably, are there to honor high quality and High achievements in each respected field. Russel Crowe does an adequate job, but his acting in his other Oscar nominated films like ""The Informant"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"" were light years ahead of his performance in ""Gladiator"". Furthermore, Giving best picture to this film was mind boggling. I personally feel that the only reason this movie was even in the running at all, was because of the money it made. It was a good action movie and nothing more. Hey, remember that ""Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" was also up for best picture that year. In my opinion, It ran circles around ""Gladiator"". Wheras ""Gladiator' was just a good action film. CTHD was a phenomenal action movie and love story and should have won the top prize.","

"chrisbrown6453","8 June 2001","Gladiator is a truly great depiction of an important part of early Roman Empire. Yes, Gladiator will probably win the Oscar of Best Picture of 2000, but should it?  While I agree that watching it was a great pleasure, I am not convinced that it was the best movie made last year.  In any other year, not containing a film named Cast Away', Gladiator would get my absolute vote, however in the interest of keeping this review to the movie at hand, I will not name which one I feel should win.Viewing Gladiator was definitely a spectacle everyone should endure. It has everything any good movie should; an original story, great acting, and truly awe-inspiring direction.  To be transported to a world that existed over 1800 years ago, and experience the very same excitement the Romans were able to enjoy is just incredible.  Ridley Scott struck did very well with his direction of Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Neilsen, and Oliver Reed (who unfortunately suffered a fatal heart attack during filming).  Scotts' ability to `see' the action in his head, and create the effect for the cameras is wonderful.  This is a far different epic than Alien', and far better than Hannibal'. 
Russell Crowe is fabulous as Maximus Meridius, the great soldier planning to return to his home after fighting his last battle only to find himself thrust between the dead kings will for him to become the new king, and Commudus, the son of the former king wanting him to stay and fight for him. Crowe is perfect in this role, he is strong, rugged looking, and has become quite a good actor since his days in The Quick and the Dead' and the awful Virtuosity'.Joaquin Phoenix is magnificent in his role as Commudus.   Only recently have I noticed what great acting skills Phoenix possesses, and how well he transforms into such diverse characters, such the same can be said of Ewan McGregor and his diverse roles in Trainspotting', Little Voice' and Star Wars: Episode I'.  Phoenix's ability to present himself in such a devious and hateful aspect is awe-inspiring.  As the sister of Commudus, Lucilla (Connie Neilsen) has to play both devoted to her brother, and sympathetic to Maximus.  Neilsen pulls this off beautifully and she is very convincing in her role.The story is beautifully written, and there is never a dull moment.  After I viewed the film for the first time I felt that the gladiator fight scenes were too far apart, and not enough of them were in the movie.  However, a very good friend of mine, we shall call him Michael DeZubiria (check out his reviews), felt it necessary to explain to me that Gladiator is not just a story about fighting, but a story about the life struggles of one man and his quest to avenge the brutal killing of his family. 
Now, while I admit that I liked this film, I am not ready, nor will I ever be ready, to call it the best movie of 2000 (see my Cast Away review).  I do not want to take anything away from Gladiator, it's just that there was a more original, creative film in 2000.","

"cutter-12","29 March 2002","There is much to appreciate about about this picture but at the same time there is much to castigate as well. What could have been a thoroughly involving story turns out to be crippled by a lean script, some very indecisive direction and choppy editing. Not to mention some bad casting in the form of Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, a role which cries out to have been the last role played by Anthony Quinn.The film starts out well and looks bleakly authentic in its depiction of the pivotal battle in the wars between the barbarian tribes of Germania and the Roman Empire. But as the story gives way to 40 minutes of exposition following Commodus and Lucilla's introduction, Ridley Scott seems to tack things on whenever the script runs into weak spots. This leaves the film without a flowing narrative and it seems to want to please a mindless summer movie action market while at the same time aspiring to be something deeper. What it leaves us with is a schizophrenic, unequivocal story full of contradictions. There seems to be an epidemic in the past three or four years - films like this, Titanic, The Patriot, Pearl Harbor, Enemy at the Gates etc, try hard to be great epic films but at their core they are very slight and even trivial. The story in Gladiator holds promise but what little conflict there is set up and thrown at us in the first hour, leaving just a linear resolution to unfold for the remainder. A shame because so many elements could have been introduced in this story to make it truly an awesome and thoughtful epic. I guess complex stories like Spartacus and Ben-Hur will never be made again. This one falls somewhere short, though better than Demitrius and the Gladiators and the film it heavily borrows its narrative structure from - The fall of the Roman Empire.Technically the CGI is at times seamless and other times poor. When our troop of Gladiators run into the colosseum for the first time however the effect is absolutely jaw dropping and the scene that follows certainly delivers the action goods. The acting is very good throughout except for Tomas Arana as Quintus (about as bad as John Dall in Spartacus) and the aforementioned Richard Harris. Like Braveheart, not a bad entertainment experience but highly Hollywoodized and with an uneven narrative. But unlike Braveheart, the ending to Gladiator is a just a little embarrassing as it rips off both Braveheart and Titanic to far less effect. If you can get past the flaws, not the worst Roman spectacle on offer. Too highly rated at 8.1/10.","

"Hancock_the_Superb","21 December 2007","In Rome circa 185 AD, General Maximus (Russell Crowe) leads a successful expedition against Germanic tribes in the northern empire. Dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) confides that he is to succeed as Emperor, to the chagrin of the vain, ego-maniacal Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who kills Marcus and usurps the throne. Maximus is expelled from the army, his family is killed, and he ultimately ends up in Rome as a gladiator for Proximo (Oliver Reed). Defying the will of the Emperor and eager to have his revenge, Maximus becomes a hero to the masses and joins Commodus's sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and a cabal of Senators led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) in an attempt to bring down Commodus.Gladiator is something of a paradox. As a well-made, entertaining action film, it's hard to beat. Its attempts to be something more, however... not so much. It's very entertaining, an excellent crowd-pleaser to be sure, but it's far from the great film it's widely considered to be.Gladiator wants to be something significant. Its multi-faceted plot, its commentary on society, its distinguished cast of actors, epic battle scenes, and great musical score almost push it there. The movie borrows heavily from ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" (settings and characters), ""Spartacus"" and ""Ben-Hur"" (for the plot). This is not a criticism, merely an observation. And the movie does have an inkling of being something more than just another action movie. And yet it fails, because at heart it is basically ""Braveheart"" in a toga.Perhaps I'm just not enthralled by the film's basic storyline. See if this sounds familiar: A successful warrior who wants only to live in peace is roused to ass-kicking action by the death of his family at the hands of cartoonishly evil villains. This is the plot of ""Braveheart"", ""The Patriot"", and innumerable Westerns, action films, and Steven Seagal/Chuck Norris slugfests. Death of family members is an easy motivation for a character, and dare I suggest a lazy one. Maximus isn't a thoughtful, conflicted hero like T.E. Lawrence or Spartacus, he's just a man of action who wants to wreak vengeance on those who wronged him. In spite of its attempts to convince us otherwise, the movie is basically a Schwarzenegger or Van Damme flick set in Roman times with a lead actor who can act.The subplots of the film don't fare much better. The character of Commodus in particular is a disappointment. One of the few good things about ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" is Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Commodus. Commodus is an egomaniac with delusions of grandeur. He's not horribly complex in that film but Plummer makes it work. Whether it's the script or Joaquin Phoenix's acting, this film's Commodus is a sniveling weakling. I appreciate the effort to give him motivation (his father never truly loved him) but in his big scene with Marcus Aurelius, Commodus doesn't come across as heart-broken, merely insincere. Commodus is a petulant child who lacks menace. David Schofield's duplictious Senator Falco is a much more effective bad guy. The Senate plot against the Emperor is under-developed and comes across as a bad pastiche of ""Spartacus"".On a purely action level, the movie is pretty good. The epic battle which opens the film is not particularly impressive in my opinion, but the gladiator combats later in the film are impressive. The visceral thrill of a gladiatorial match comes across well, particularly when Proximo's gladiators ""upset"" an enemy team. The fight between Maximus and the ""Tigress of Gaul"" is very well-handled, as is the final duel between Commodus and Maximus. The CGI is of mixed quality. It's impressive in some scenes (notably Commodus's entry into Rome) but in other parts it's murky and distracting. Hans Zimmer's score is haunting and helps drive the film's more powerful moments.The movie excels largely because of Russell Crowe. FOTRE failed because Stephen Boyd is a block of wood; Crowe, playing a very similar role, excels. Maximus is not a particularly noble hero but he's a fabulous action star, and Crowe does bring a degree of intelligence and complexity to complement the ass-kicking. The supporting cast is mostly under-used. Djimon Honsou, Oliver Reed, David Schofield and Derek Jacobi give the most memorable supporting performances in the film despite very limited screen time. Richard Harris is disappointing as Marcus Aurelius, and Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen aren't particularly compelling either.""Gladiator"" is one of the best action films ever made, on a purely action level. But in its attempts to be something more... well, not so much, I'm afraid.7/10","

"Hitchcoc","23 October 2001","I never got around to seeing this in the theater. I'm sure it's a marvelous spectacle on the big screen. I don't know what it was. I found the acting good, the spectacle and special effects outstanding, the hero one we could cheer for. Why, then, do I feel so empty? Was it all the hype, best picture of the year? I just don't know. It was totally predictable. There were absolutely no surprises. After seeing The Patriot and realizing both movies have the same plot, I expected something more. Why are evil Roman Emperors always portrayed as cowardly wimps? I still don't believe that he actually was willing to go into the arena with Maximus. He wouldn't have anything to do with war. There is the obligatory killing of the family. That goes back to Macbeth folks. If a ruler wants to stay a ruler, leave the family alone. I know it's just to show how evil and powerful the Emperor is, but do you want the top general in the army gunning for you?--this will guarantee it. There is masterful cinematography in this film. The scenes of violence are masterful. Although once you've seen one fountain of blood spouting up, you've seen them all--one decapitation is like another. What I wanted was to see the characters really dealing with the evil of the times and confronting it. There is always that army out there ready to be commanded again. There is always the possibility that the greatest empire in the world can be destroyed by one guy (like when Mel Gibson won the Revolutionary War all by himself). I think this is really quite a good film. But I don't see it as deserving to be named the best of any year. We've come to demand a movie that looks good rather than one that grasps our heart.","

"CherryBlossomBoy","22 October 2006","There is an unwritten rule in movie making that if you have an excellent script it doesn't matter how you film it. If you have a lousy script - then everything else matters, the direction, the cinematography, the acting, the music... ""Gladiator"" is an epitome of the latter half of that rule. The case where direction, music, acting and art direction completely redeemed a crappy story.For me it took watching it in German overdubbing. As I don't speak German there was nothing to detract me from visuals and music. And it's a new experience on another level. But more on that later. First the crappy part. The story.Make no mistake, whether you care about history or not, this is a horrible script. It's taking huge (and quite unacceptable) liberties with the period it purports to portray, it's unconvincing even on its own terms, the dialog is pretty much high school and in its core it's a predictable revenge story told a zillion times before. Apparently (according to a documentary about Hollywood screenwriters) only Russell Crowe didn't know what turd the script was so he contributed himself with the juvenile ""husband of the dead wife"" speech.Ridley Scott and his crew apparently knew what stinker they had to work with and did their best to defeat it with excellence in all areas and actually made two films in one.On the surface it's a revenge story. The hero, a favorite army general turned gladiator, seeks revenge against a young emperor, who had general's family killed during the tumultuous succession to the throne. The military battles and the gladiatorial bouts required for this aspect of the movie are done both to tremendous detail and on a grand scale. With the help of CGI they are seen in all their glory and gore. Some accuse Scott of shying away from action but his direction shows everything one needs to see. Yes, the cuts are brief, the camera sometimes doesn't follow through, but the editing is pure poetry and you miss nothing. Cinematography-wise every frame is shot in a way that you could just hang it on a wall as a nice picture. Costumes and scenery are impeccable. A revenge story, yes, but well worth watching.But on another level ""Gladiator"" plays out like a remake of ""Fall of a Roman Empire"". But it's not in the script. It's in the mood set again by production. This other story is about the decline and death of classical Rome and its ideals. There is simple yet effective symbolism to express it, the play on dark and light and the sunrise-sunset arc. The movie starts with a battle at dawn, the way the Rome itself had once dawned, fighting. There is an ideal Roman hero, valiant and dutiful, there's a typical Roman villain, clandestine and scheming. Hero does his best in the light, the villain does his worst in the dark, whenever they swap environments during the movie they fail miserably. The story ends at sunset, symbolizing the end of the Empire itself, and although an uplifting speech is given at that point it is defeated by the setting sun.The feeling of the doom is constantly emphasized by melancholic music. The dreamlike experience of the main character who is already dead but doesn't yet know it is enhanced when he finally visits Rome and the city is an idealistic, blown in proportions version of itself. The script may be a complete falsification of history, but the feeling of decline one gets when watching those scenes is probably completely faithful.So forget the story and the closing speech. Watch and listen the movie. The Roman Empire is living and dying once more before your very eyes.","

"spaulagain","21 September 2020","While Gladiator is traditional (if not basic) in its overall plot, the characters and performances bring the trophy home in this film. Beautifully shot, with just the right amount of violence and emotion, it's a good technical film as well. Some may find parts of it to be a little cheesy, or some of the side characters to just be meh, those flaws are greatly overshadowed by the leads.Crowe is fantastic of course, but Joaquin Phoenix steals the film with an incredible performance as Commodus. From his first scene, to the last, you build an intense hate for his character. His creepy nature just rubs it all in.This was the first film I saw (when it came out) that I then knew of Phoenix's skills and potential. He's been a favorite ever since.","

"tedg","7 May 2000","Two things about this film intrigue me: the novel integrated talents of Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe.We are creatures who depend on idea fragments in everything we do. Virtually everything is a rehash, sometimes creative but mostly not. When someone or something comes along and adds to the vocabulary, something essentially new, it is a big deal -- that's my definition of genius. Today, a major force in defining our basic vocabulary is cinema, the visual element of filmaking. But all the easy stuff has been done as we leave the first generations of the art.So when someone comes along who can conceive a world that is new and unfamiliar, and who can actually deliver the illusion of being in that world, it is notable. Scott does that here (and in Blade Runner). Kubrick did it once or maybe twice; Polanski had the skills when he had an edge, but this is exceedingly rare. Note here how little quoting Scott does of prior battle in his battle scene, how Ben Hur (and all the lesser period pieces) are not at all referenced. How new this all is. (The only concession is the annoying British accent of the Romans.)What is remarkable is that it is all visual. It is not in the writing, the effects per se, or the acting, though they are all good enough. I intend to see this film several more times for just the visual experience. I suspect that because of the coherence and advance of the visual vocabulary. this will be seen as a landmark film long after Private Ryan and Titanic become footnotes.But there is also Crowe, and there's something notable here. I don't see great acting in the normal sense, but there is something else, and this seems new to me as well. To check this, I reviewed LA Confidential and The Insider. Crowe has the ability to develop tension, a normal enough skill, but he also has the ability to project this tension into the environment of the film. Watch how the scenes flow as his acting in one scene is tossed into another; it's remarkable.When he did this in The Insider, he seems to use as his resonator the unwitting, ever-bombastic Pacino. Here, He uses the similar exaggerated scope of the story, both the setting and the violence of the context.WARNING! Spoilers follow:Both Scott and Crowe seem to know what they are doing. So they have eliminated many of the elements normally required: there is no backstory, no explanation of what went before, no comic relief, just the barest of scaffolding. But in that, it is made of huge, strong girders. In another film, we'll have revenge driven by the death of the Hero's wife. Here, she and their child are gang-raped, burned until nearly dead, then crucified. In another film, the bad guy is conventionally bad, but here we have patricide and incestual rape. In another period film, we'd have lots of street scenes (which are cheap) to convey a sense of place: not so here. Nothing not essential to the core projection and resonant backdrop are used. So instead of parading the effects (as with Titanic or Jurassic Park), they are handled casually, incidentally as background. Just a huge visual sweep through which tension is passed. It is early to know, but this could be one of the great films.","

"shahrad","2 February 2001","Gladiator is one of those movies that  tries to present a splendid old story with today standards of film making so younger persons of our time could be impressed by that too. well, what do you expect? Gladiator tries to be(or imitate) something like Ben Hur and Spartacus but fails in many ways. I agree that the visual effects are amazing, but the score is not a masterpiece and the most important thing-in my idea-the screenplay is too ordinary and has nothing particular and new to present. It seems that the real point of killing Maximus is to make audiences cry.( I couldn't find any other reason to get him killed). But, in some ways the movie is worth watching. I claim that I bought the tape of the movie, because I felt that my library needed it.","

"tieman64","26 February 2012","""Father, I would have butchered the whole world...if you would only love me."" - Commodus Ridley Scott directs ""Gladiator"". The film's influenced by Cecil B. DeMille's epics (""The Crusades"", ""The Sign of the Cross""), and Italian/Hollywood sword-and-sandal movies (""Spartacus"", ""Ben Hur"", ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"", ""El Cid"", ""Barabbas"", ""Demetrius and the Gladiators"" etc), all films Scott adored as a child. As with Scott's other historical epics (""Conquest of Paradise"", ""Robin Hood"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven""), artwork and paintings the director came across as an art student seem to be a big influence, in this case the works of Jean-Leon Gerome (Scott's acknowledged Gerome's ""Pollice Verso"" as the reason he decided to direct ""Gladiator""), 19th century Orientalists, Charles Gleyre, Caravaggio and Delaroche.Of course the chief pleasure of any Scott movie is his emulation of famous painters and/or print artists. Think ""Blade Runner's"" nods to Edward Hopper, Enki Bilal and Jean Giraud (Moebius), ""Alien's"" reliance on Giger's ""Necronomicon"", and ""The Duellist's"" nods to Caspar David Friedrich and Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon's"", another painterly film, though Kubrick subverts the idyllic charms of Gainsborough and Watteau, whereas Scott goes for straight Romanticism (his final shot's a direct copy of Friedrich's ""Wanderer above the Sea of Fog""). The problem, though, is that Scott's images can never touch any of these other artists. Worse still, they're always aligned to silly screenplays.""Gladiator"" stars Russell Crowe as Maximus, the Roman general asked by the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius to take over as ruler of Rome. Before he is granted power, however, the emperor's tyrannical son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix, playing Commodus with severe daddy issues), orders the execution of Maximus and his family. Maximus survives, and embarks on a quest for vengeance. The film watches as Maximus falls from general to slave, rises from slave to gladiator and finally from gladiator to brave warrior who dares defy an emperor. The film ends with Maximus given a messianic, ""Braveheart""/""Spartacus"" inspired slow death.Great visuals and sequences are scattered about, but Scott's CGI lacks the gravity of even the FX work DeMille did a century earlier, the film is surprisingly stiff for an ""action epic"", ""Gladiator's"" adherence to old Hollywood storytelling, spectacle and violence makes it an immediately dated affair and Scott's dialogue reads like a bad stage-play (""Sometimes I do what I want to do, the rest of the time I do what I have to""), devoid of depth, nuance or wit. The film's overall tone is a cross between a WWF wrestling match and a perfume commercial, Scott dressing things up in a New Age score, gauzy filters, long focal lenses, ubiquitous smoke, flares and mist. It's ""Braveheart"" with less camp value. Like DeMille, what you mostly marvel at is the sheer scale of the production, though in our era of excess, such logistics have lost much of their weight.Hollywood isn't known for treating history seriously, but ""Gladiator"" is funny in the way it bulldozes yesteryear. The film ends with the fictional Maximus killing the real Emperor Commodus in gladiatorial combat, a mano-a-mano scenario that's the equivalent of Indiana Jones killing Hitler in a game of ping pong. Lucilla, the sister of Commodus (who had actually been executed at the beginning of Commodus' reign), then announces that Rome will ""honor Maximus"" by ""reversing Commodus' despotism"" and ""restoring the greatness of the Republic"". What the hell? The film somehow manages to turn Maximus' death (lots of Christian and crucification iconography) into a ""hero dying for the sins of Rome"" narrative, Maximus' death steering a resurrected Rome away from corruption and toward its supposedly saintly, Republican origins (historically, it was when Rome became a Republic that it turned into a psycho-expanding Empire, and it was as a Republic, and not while under dictatorial rule, that she was at her most bloody). You saw the same thing years ago with British Imperial nostalgia, Britain romanticising its colonial achievements and declaring them a proper source of pride, and today in the US with desires for ""strict constitutionalists"" and a return to those ""good old days"". You know, when you could own a slave and scalp Injuns. So by the film's end, ""Gladiator"" has turned the historical fall of the Roman Empire into Rome's ""purification"" and ""rebirth"" via the ""true warrior son"" of a ""departed Emperor"" ""nobly returning"" and replacing a ""bad, fake, fascist Emperor"". Cue psycho-expansionist George Bush Jr's coincidental ascension to the throne the same year Scott's film was released. It's what daddy wanted.End result: a violent Hollywood spectacle about the violent spectacle of gladiatorial combat, which makes fun of art which panders to the mob, whilst nevertheless glorifying violence, ""glory"", ""honor"" and the prosperity of Roman Imperialism. Note the way the simple, bare-bones existence of Maximus (the guy literally rallies his troops by stressing his love for simple, subsidence farming) is contrasted with Commodus' extravagance. Commodus may prove that the dumb masses only enjoy bread and circus antics, but Maximus trumps this by gaining support through the universal love for the simple, martial virtues that supposedly made Rome great. These virtues were more heroically illustrated by the Germanic fighters and Celtic tribes (ironic: ""Gladiator"" catapulted Celtic singer Enya to super-stardom), quickly slaughtered by Scott, who were defending themselves against Rome at the beginning of the film. 7.5/10 - Worth two viewings. See 1964's ""Becket"" and 1968's ""The Lion In Winter"".","

"sonofhades","7 June 2001","If you know ANYTHING about the history of Rome, please do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie.Lets see: Film opening sequence. General Maximus speaks such nonsense about troops, casualties etc. The massive battle in the movie would have been fine if they didn't have archers or catapults in the scene. After that, they should have used the scene in ""braveheart"", instead of a film about Romans.Remember that Roman army didn't charge into combat without controlled formations? Not considering this fact, the battle is the BEST part of the film. After this incident, the plot of the movie is sooooo predictable, as if the manuscript had been written by someone with the imagination of 12 year old child.Actors then...I have only seen worse acting performed by mr. Sylvester Stallone than the Aussie playing the role of Maximus. Even a wooden log could have put more feeling into the scene when he finds his family slaughtered. Besides, he rode a huge journey in one day, came to the smoking ruins of his villa from a distance of 1000 klicks (try that yourself).And the final scene: Emperor challenging a gladiator into a duel, how stupid is that? This movie has the same value as a historical movie as Rambo III.","

The sister of Commedus, Lucilla (who had actually been executed at the beginning of Commedus' reign) announces that we are all going to honor Maximus and restore the Republic.For a Roman history buff, this is like saying World War II was Hitler giving us all Ice Cream.What actually happened was that after Commedus (who wasn't that bad of a guy, really) Rome went into an embarrassing period known as the ""Year of the Five Emperors, where a decent man was assassinated, the office of emperor was auctioned off, and three rival generals launched a civil war.This is universally agreed to be the tipping point of Rome's inevitable decline.","

His despair over the death of his family and the future he's denied, his disgust over the games, and his quest for vengeance when he finds the man who killed his family and his close friend.Joaquin Phoenix also does a marvelous job for Commodus. Successfully showing him as a spoiled rich boy lusting for more power, and viewing his as someone not to be feared, but pitied.Even though Oliver Reed died before he could shoot some very important scenes, they flawlessly brought him back from the dead digitally to say his final words, ""Shadows and Dust,"" from a test shoot earlier making the approach of the climax even more gripping.Alien, Blade Runner, and now Gladiator.

"mjneu59","22 November 2010","Ridley Scott's Oscar-winning ersatz epic is one of the least spectacular big-screen spectacles ever sold to an undemanding public: a sand-and-sandal throwback stripped of the genre's all too necessary guilty pleasures. The idea was to recreate for today's digital generation a wide-screen Roman Empire costume drama from Hollywood's pre-video adolescence, but all the fancy computer imagery (and state-of-the-art budget) only makes the new film look and sound more solemn and pompous than its beefcake role models. Worse yet, the occasional token nod toward old-fashioned visual grandeur isn't enough to camouflage the claustrophobic TV screen compositions and typically frantic Madison Avenue editing job (designed, perhaps, to hide the digital wrinkles).Russell Crowe is the title character: a Roman general fallen from imperial favor, battling for his life and honor on the floor of the Coliseum, where the prize for victory is another day of slavery and the cost of defeat is a mercifully quick death. Crowe's protagonist is a man of few words, most of them delivered in a flat monotone, matching the equally colorless photography, shaded in picturesque hues of misty gray and mud brown sepia.Don't expect any surprises from the strictly formula riches-to-rags-to-rebel hero scenario, which doesn't even allow the villains (degenerate emperor Joaquin Phoenix and his sister/lover Connie Nielson) a chance to have any fun. Audiences (and too many critics, who should have known better) conditioned by habit to reject anything original made the film a worldwide hit, but even in our current age of diminished expectations it should have been clear that they don't make 'em like they used to anymore.","

I love Russell Crowe but the fact that he won Best Actor for this and not for ""The Insider"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"" just doesn't make sense. To me he just seems bored in some scenes. I wonder if the Oscar voters watched any of the other films from that year because this sure wasn't better than ""Traffic"". Of the 2 and a half hours running time, there are really only 30-40 minutes of excitement. The rest is average at best and the ending is just ridiculous. THIS IS NOT A CLASSIC. ""Gladiator"" is a good film but does not deserve the praise that it is given by most on this site. I give it a 6 now but my opinion for this film drops every time I watch it.","

"smaniatopoulos","8 December 2023","The Gladiator came out in 2000. One year later it would be followed by the Fellowship of the Ring. One year earlier, the Matrix had changed the way we look at scifi. It was a great movie of the rather rare ""historic fantasy"" genre (although at the time it was mislabeled a ""sword and sandal epic"") which has produced a rather limited number of great movies.But the Gladiator, unlike most movies of this genre, remains one of the most beloved Hollywood epics.In hindsight, the reason is obvious: it has Russel Crowe, the greatest rising star of that generation in top form, a form which sadly did not last very long. It has the one and only Ridley Scott going full throttle for the first time since Alien, delivering a visual masterpiece with some of the most iconic scenes of the 21st century, such as the ""hand that caresses the wheat in the field"", a shot that has been copied countless times.It has a great story, which is offensively inaccurate from a historical standpoint but catches the spirit of the devoted hero that falls victim of unethical powers, is betrayed, destroyed but yet he rises up and fulfills his destiny.And of course it has Hans Zimmer, whose soundtrack has become one of the most well known musical themes of all time.The movies was flawed and flawless at the same time, equally grand and inaccurate, epic and engaging, sad and exhilarating. It was a kick ass movie that nailed it.And, maybe above all, it was the most successful movie of a golden era of cinema:
From 1995 to 2005, cinema changed forever: directors broke boundaries in virtually every genre, from scifi (the Matrix) and fantasy (LOTR) to comedy (the Big Lebowski), action (Kill Bill), and drama (Fight club).Hell, even Chinese cinema had joined that great wave of innovative and brave filmmaking with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.The studios could not believe their luck. Veterans, newcomers, new writers, new cinematographers, everyone was at the top of their game, making great movie after great movie.I do not know exactly when this phenomenon started, but it is my firm belief that it was pushed to the forefront by Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.We were reaching the end of the century, a new millenium was about to begin, and suddenly everyone was up for trying something new.Ridley Scott was not new, of course, but the great recognition of his art and the artistic value of Blade Runner had become generally acknowledged only a few years ago, and this realization may have contributed to giving him the chance for a new visual masterpiece, helmed by an Australian newcomer who had only played one big part as supporting actor in a film noir (LA Confidential).Ridley gave it his all, and the Gladiator remains, to this day, his most successful and highest rated movie.Sadly, the wave of innovation did not last as long as it could: it was gradually replaced by the unprecedented success of the superhero movie, which almost destroyed cinema, first by razing the box office and once all the good movies had been made, by trying to outsell competition disguised as a form of social platform for inclusion, diversity, equality, gender rights, and all sorts of activist ideas.20years later, no mainstream studio cares anymore about making art or telling great stories.It's all about making good PR in Hollywood regardless of talent or content.We are now reaching a quarter of a century from the last golden era of cinema.The superhero genre has finally reached its inevitable end. And finally, after almost two decades, an exceptional historical movie (Oppenheimer) and an original concept (Barbie) are in the top-5 grossing movies of the year, while almost half of the new superhero movies have flopped.Let's just hope that we are nearing a new age of cinema, one where the medium can be restored to its former glory.The Gladiator remains, to this day, one of the greatest timeless examples of how cinema can truly enthrall and inspire people, even those who do not necessarily believe in art.","

"marcin_kukuczka","18 June 2006","They were just shadows and dust. Yet, their courageous deeds have been admired for hundreds of years. Their name was ... gladiators.Since 1959 and the release of the ultra popular Roman epic BEN HUR, many people have thought that William Wyler's movie reached the ultimate splendor on screen and no other production may take its stead. However, the memorable year 2000 sees a premiere of GLADIATOR by Ridley Scott. The movie's title does not indicate any novel nor any specific period of Roman history. Yet, the film becomes one of the top Hollywood productions. What is so extraordinary about it that GLADIATOR is admired not only by epic fans but by the audiences of different interests, different preferences, different expectations from a movie.First of all, GLADIATOR, unlike many other epics, shows a very realistic image of the Roman Empire and makes a perfect use of this on screen. In this case, the movie which discusses a very distant period in time (2nd century A.D.) occurs to be clearly interpreted and understood by the 21 century-audience. This fact proves a great talent of the director, Ridley Scott, who exactly knows viewers' expectations. Such a movie is more a spectacle and entertainment than pure history. Therefore, even if there are historic figures in the film, we cannot treat it as history and look for historical accuracy or inaccuracy. It is much more since it generally shows Rome, its power, its emperors, its people, its games, finally...its gladiators.It seems quite unnecessary to present the content of the film while hundreds have done this before me. What I want to concentrate on GLADIATOR's universal aspect, which makes it an exceptional epic. As a matter of fact, no one will fully understand the story of Maximus (Russell Crowe) without profound reflections. Simply, the entire content of GLADIATOR is one great symbol. A simple man, a farmer becomes a great leader, emperor's friend. Yet, when times change, he gets through a personal tragedy becoming a slave, a gladiator whose primary task is to amuse people and the corrupted emperor by killing. Nevertheless, it is him who is honored at his death - He was the one who loved Rome. In my opinion, the very first shot of the movie shows it all - where Maximus heart is - a bird symbolizing gentleness, and fields symbolizing his life. The final fight on arena between emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and Maximus cannot be treated historically. It is a symbolic battle between two visions of Rome (using modern language - between two visions of the world) - the one of honor, equality and love and the one of decadence, slavery and corruption. And this is, I think, the most important message of this movie. In this perspective, the movie develops all characters universally.CAST: Russell Crowe, who portrays Maximus, does a very fine job. He portrays a man of a good heart who is exposed to living in the reality that is against all he heads for, a leader who got a new name, ""gladiator"". I loved his performance in one scene more than in any other - in the conversation with the emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Wonderful meeting of two seeing one goal - goodness of Rome! Joaquin Phoenix is also very memorable as brute Commodus, a corrupted emperor who is, on the one hand, a blood sucker, but, on the other hand, a man who wants to be loved. I also loved the performance of Connie Nielsen as Lucilla. This beautiful Danish actress very well fits to this role portraying a woman who lives in the very ambiguous reality. A note must also be made of Derek Jacobi, unforgettable Claudius from a perfect BBC series made almost 30 years earlier. Yet, two performances by already late actors are a must to mention, Richard Harris's phenomenal portrayal of Marcus Aurelius and Oliver Reed's slave trader Proximo. Oliver Reed died during filming and his death is a terrible loss to all film industry. We thank him for such a powerful performance in this film, unforgettable, forever in our hearts and minds.Some people say that GLADIATOR is too violent. I admit that there are very brutal moments, especially the ones showing arena fights. Nevertheless, that is what these fights looked like. Visual effects of the movie are so stunning that I was lost in admiration. Commodus's triumphant entrance to Rome (a bit exaggerated in size but representing not that much a city but rather its power), the sequence at Zucchabar, a fictional Roman province set in Mauretania Caesariensis, the imperial palace, the brutal battle in the woods of Germania - all is filled with unforgettable grandeur! The locations at Morocco, Malta, Italy and Spain add a thrill to the spectacle.And the music... it is half of the whole entertainment to watch GLADIATOR without the admiration of its excellent musical pieces. It is a flow from sentimentalism, through exotic sounds to the tunes expressing the gore of the arena. I loved the title song, it touched my heart. There is something like a gentle power in it...GLADIATOR is in many aspects a film that will become a cult movie, not only an ancient epic but a masterpiece of movie art. When I was a boy, I was saddened by the fact that I don't live in such times like the 1950s when great masterpieces were released like BEN HUR, QUO VADIS or THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. Yet, GLADIATOR made my dream come true. We all do live in such times, the times of great movies and this is, without doubt, one of such films. 10/10! They were just shadows and dust. However, who among them would predict that they would once (in almost 2000 years) be the characters of such a film masterpiece. So were only the emperors immortal?","

"cxw1065","18 May 2000","I am usually worried that I'm in for a big let-down when I am looking forward to a film as much as I was to this one.  This time however, I was very pleasantly suprised, when Gladiator not only fulfilled but surpassed my expectations.  It's a brilliant film, which (while containing weaknesses such as a script which wasn't quite as good as it could have been, and one climactic scene which completely changes, and ruins, the ending) manages to engage your heart and mind.The performances are without exception excellent (although the accents may distract a bit, there is such a wide variety of them).  I must single out for commendation Mr. Phoenix, who despite his youth manages to portray a character with such conviction that you never for a moment doubt his interpretation.  His physical performance is as good as his mental one.The film rests firmly on the (extremely attractive and capable) shoulders of one Russell Crowe.  In a tour-de-force performance, he manages to convey a man (not a superhuman) with frailties and doubts and fears and heart.  I cannot convey to you how brilliant this man's performance was.  If anyone else had been this character, the film would have rated at best a five out of ten.Kudos to Russell Crowe, and to Ridley Scott, for managing to keep this film on a level with humanity, rather than one in which the characters become killing machines.A must see, five stars out of five.","

"cjswan","16 May 2000","Germania, 150 AD, the setting of Gladiator's opening scene. Far from the blazing sun and dazzlingly beauty of ancient Rome, Ridley Scott shoots the opening sequence in a subdued light. The Roman legions are nonetheless impeccably turned out as they face the comparatively disorganised rabble that inhabits this miserable environment. Caesar's soldiers seem somewhat misplaced here. However, Russell Crowe is at home in this environment of knee-deep mud and merciless snow. He commands the screen with all the virtues of his motto: Strength and Honour.'The plot, with its hero-to-zero-to-hero nature, runs through Gladiator's every vein. As General Maximus, Russell Crowe is welcomed by Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Richard Harris) to take the Roman throne as Emperor of a new Republic. All does not run smoothly however as mislead heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) takes over Rome with ill-gotten domination, having dispatched his own Father. Maximus is cast out to find his family murdered and his Spanish farm burnt to the ground. Taken in as a slave by Proximo (Reed), Maximus becomes a Gladiator and starts his journey to the Coliseum and revenge against Commodus.Scott's cast is powerful and he is not left wanting as powerful performances are delivered by all. Due to his untimely mid-production death, Oliver Reed is created in some scenes by the grace of computer graphics, which are as convincing as they come; sometimes making it difficult to differentiate between Reed himself and his computerised counterpart.
It is, however, the supporting actors who create many of Gladiator's best dialogue-based scenes. In an accomplished demonstration of her acting ability as Lucilla, Connie Nielsen saves the occasional scene as Joaquim Phoenix shows us that he can do evil', but is less convincing when it comes to the more emotional qualities of his role.As a vehicle for the plot, Scott's beautifully created and highly symbolic (there is an image of fire in nearly every shot of the film) dialogue scenes are of a certain merit with digitally created backgrounds that encompass the meticulous nature of the Roman Empire. However, dialogue alone does not an epic movie make, and it is in the film's spectacular action sequences that Gladiator come into its own. Shot on location in Malta, Scott's first arena was built by an army of locals and commanded some 5000 extras (a large majority of whom were of a cardboard variety). All of this pales in comparison as we arrive in a digitally created Rome which makes some scenes in Ben Hur some somewhat small scale. The Coliseum is immense, both inside and out, and the computerised provides the electric atmosphere in which Crowe and his feline companions (four sizeable, and real, Bengal tigers) perform.The battle sequences are perfectly choreographed and shot as iconic masks and typically Roman chariots are abundant in their power and imagery. As swords clash and heads roll, Ridley Scott is triumphant in the application of special effects technology and his directorial prowess.Always one to embrace technology, Scott's views over Rome's landscape are reminiscent of the beautifully created cityscape of Blade Runner. This is a film that fears so little and boasts so much, even a lady archer being sliced clean in half by a spiked chariot wheel!All those involved with Gladiator should be delighted and confident with their creation, for indeed this is a convincing and enthralling display with epic proportions to take the wind from James Cameron's titanic sails.","

"BA_Harrison","27 April 2018","In the event of his death, ageing Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) intends to leave his trusted Hispano-Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe) in charge of Rome, instead of allowing his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) to become his successor. Commodus has other ideas: he murders his father and orders Maximus to be executed. Maximus, not one to give up quietly, makes a daring escape, and, badly wounded, heads for home, where he discovers that his wife and son have been crucified on Commodus' orders. Passing out from the pain of his injury, Maximus is captured by slavers, nursed back to health and forced to fight as a gladiator. This new life eventually leads him to the Colosseum of Rome, where he finally comes face to face with the man who betrayed him.From director Ridley Scott, Gladiator is a historical epic to rival the classics from the 'golden age' of Hollywood. Opening in 180 A.D., with a brilliantly orchestrated battle between the Roman armies and the tribes of Germania, Scott's film grabs the viewer's full attention from the outset and doesn't let go until the end, having delivered an Oscar-winning central performance from Crowe, a memorable score by Hans Zimmer, excellent supporting roles from the likes of Harris, Phoenix, Connie Nielsen and Oliver Reed, and some of the most impressively bloody scenes of hand to hand combat ever filmed.If I were to choose my favourite scene, it would be the 're-enactment' of the battle of Carthage, a savage piece of action cinema in which Maximus and his fellow gladiators are ushered into the arena like cattle to the slaughter, only to turn the tables on their attackers, winning the hearts of the Roman masses in the process. A rousing, blood drenched spectacle, it's a fine example of Scott's expert direction, a masterclass in camera placement and movement, editing (the violence is extreme, but the film doesn't wallow in the gore), sound design and special effects, which still thrills even after all of these years.","

"alice liddell","16 May 2000","There is a lovely film in here about a spoilt brat teenager who unfortunately has tyrannical rule over the Roman Empire.  So whereas most sulky boys kick tables and storm off to their room, Commodus Caesar gets to throw those who annoy and humiliate him to digitally enhanced cats. Joaquin Phoenix gives a magnificent performance, camp in the best swords and sandals tradition, throwing childish fits when he doesn't get his way, sporting marvellously gothic eyeliner (Romans vs Goths, you see), scheming elaborate punishments for his big sister, which, for him, unlike the rest of us, who get our hair pulled, can actually, horribly, be realised.It's also nice to see that the hackneyed tide of postmodernism has been stemmed Canute-like, and a complex period in Roman history, with its plagues, revolts, tyrannies and back-room intrigues and murders can be 'crystallised' in a young boy's feeling unloved by his father.  Haven't we all felt this melancholy burden at one time or another, the failure to do what is right, honourable and Stoic, when ambition and privilege seem much more immediately rewarding?Add to this the accursed, tragic flaws of incest and worse (the difference between mad tyrant and noble hero must always be expressed in terms of neurotic sexuality and fertility-turned-ascetic renunciation), and you have a truly harassed, 'modern' hero, well supported by a ripe mixture of theatrical greats (Derek Jacobi) and former 60s icons (Oliver Reed, David Hemmings - is this Scott's THE LIMEY?).  He gets to watch some champion gladiating too.Of course, a film of this stature, size and scope must inevitably have its longueurs, here an elaborate sub-plot involving Russell Crowe, an inexorable melange of MAD MAX/BRAVEHEART (noble hero turned insane revenger after wife and family slaughtered; the bleak landscapes witnessing vastly scaled pub brawls; the lengthy, dimly lit, self-agonising indoor scenes, as a 'man' debates within himself his 'man'liness and duty; the loaded dichotomy between caricatured, vicious Imperials and unswervingly decent warrior; buddy-buddy development; Godardian, alienating, swelling score) and SPARTACUS (the violent gladiator scenes; the chinned sincerity; the captive peasant taking on the might of the Roman Empire; the structural homophobia).Crowe is a revelation - and reveals a hitherto unmined talent for comedy and parody.  Of course, this works because, like Leslie Nielsen, he marshalls a tautly disciplined straight face, but his clenched surliness, his Heston-like intergrity, his attempt to absorb the Stoic precepts of Marcus Aurelius (his scenes with Richard Harris are worthy of that masterpiece oof classical epics, CARRY ON CLEO), his reciting dialogue Abrahams-Zucker-Abrahams would have been proud to have written, are so funny (the scene where he rises off the ground of the auditorium to 'meet' his family is pure comic genius), so expertly pomposity-bursting, so winding up the pretensions of an entire genre, I emerged from the film with great respect for this stunningly versatile, deceptive actor.He couldn't have done it, though, without the help of Ridley Scott, essaying another mass culture in decline, who has bravely exorcised the complexities, ambiguities and enigmas of BLADE RUNNER to create an admirably simplistic epic, to abandon the weight of historical validity in favour of Boys' Own fantasy.  It would have been easy with this budget to create a teeming, living, authentic Rome, but Scott the postmodernist recognises the impossibility of this project, and, in an act of avant-garde innovation, hangs his drama on a handful of geometric signifiers, with little relation to any reality beyond the drawing board.There has been an extraordinary , and for me higly promising, strain in modern Hollywood filmmaking (eg TITANIC, THE PHANTOM MENACE), in which the new digital technology is not used to create novel, vast, convincing, strange worlds, but to elucidate the principles of Brechtian epic theatre, to foreground artificiality, implausibility, soullessness, encouraging the audience out of the narrative, to stand back and reflect on issues such as the construction of history, mass spectacle etc.  The dreams of the New Wave may finally have come to fruition.Like most films of this type, GLADIATOR is about a hero who is too good for his society, who cannot live in it.  But is he?  The absence of historical verity in the story set me thinking to about what Scott was trying to say. Because the film is a story about a man who lets his family die, who isn't there for them.  This is a curious hero to celebrate, though appropriate in an age where fathers often abandon their families, even to the extent of not paying alimony.  After Maximus (Scott must have been a Monty Python fan) sees the charred crucified bodies, the film goes momentarily into dream mode.  But does it ever come out of it?  This is a story that is full of doubles, strange correspondances, mirror scenes; it thoroughly interrogates the nature of family, and finally reaches a ritual climax in which both sides of the same coin (sons) wipe each other out, like Gothic doppelgangers.  Is the whole film Maximus's guilty dream, about guilt, emasculation, eternal torture over failure, the descent into bestiality? Is it a theme of America's guilt over slavery and subsequent race traumas, or a renunciation of them (both whites and blacks are slaves here).  Whatever. This is the first great comedy of the millennium.","

"viggodahlin","9 August 2021","There is no denying it. Phoenix in all of his movies he delivers. He commits perfectly to the role he plays and in playing the character Commudus he truly shows, that it doesn't matter if he's the villain or the hero.The story in this film is quite dark if you think about it. The greatest general of Rome, Maximus continues to obliterate the enemy in his scope with extreme audacity. Although, later on we are introduced to his displeasure battling in the war and his longing to his family at home. The Caesar tells Maximus that he wants him to take over as the new Caesar after he dies. Maximus does not want the throne and so on he refuses to accept the honorful request from the Caesar.As soon as Caesar tells Commudus that instead of him, the true Caesar, Caesar wants Maximus to take the throne, it all goes to hell. Maximus gets the worst punishment possible (his family gets burned alive and he has to submit to being a slave). And after all this he still manages to rise in the ranks and ultimately overthrow the throne from winning the crowd and killing Commodus.But it wasn't this simple of a story for me, at least for the character Commodus. Commodus, he's envious, greedy, sad and a very lonely soul. From the very start we see how his own father completely and utterly humiliate him in front of the whole soldier army, and indirectly chooses the general as a ""better"" son. But he keeps his head up, he knows that he will still be the next ruler of Rome and to marry his own sister. But this plan becomes a lot more difficult when his father comes to him to say that he will pick the general as the next Caesar and not him, and that ""Your mistakes as a son, is only my mistakes as a father."" Hearing all this, he puts up a beautiful speech and then hugs his father to at last say, goodbye...Commodus kills his father and then later on picks himself to be the next Caesar as it wasn't official of his father's choice. Maximus's family dies and he gets hunted to be killed so no complications can arise. Everything works out as he wanted but nothing is what he dreamed of. The crowd of the colosseum and entire Rom boos him and want him gone. The senate isn't either to pleased about his arrival but of course one narcissistic guy enjoys his upcoming. Commodus is quickly tired of the senate and want him and his sister only to exist in this purified world. He caresses her often and eventually tries to kiss her but she in no way feels the same, she is terrified of him and hates him.Commodus doesn't care and forces her to be with him or he will kill her son. Later we see him watching the gladiator games and a particular someone getting extra attention. He goes down to see who it is and yes, it's Maximus. He tells Maximus to drop his weapon if i recall correctly, and after a short solid pause Maximus doesn't follow his orders, the CAESAR's orders. The crowd loves it and Commodus obviously can't kill Maximus in front of the crowd, then it would be impossible to get the crowd back. A little input from myself is that, this is where Commodus realizes that it truly does not matter which position he is in or Maximus for that matter, it all stays the same.After a few events unravel, Commodus faces Maximus in a 1v1 sword fight. Both lose their sword after a while but Commodus has a knife up his sleeve and tries to stab Maximus but the reverse happens and Commodus tries punching Maximus several times in his arms with nothing happening. Maximus ends it and Rome is saved.A very fine storytelling indeed. The reason as to why i focused much more on Commodus is because he is certainly more sympathetic and interesting. He truly never understood love or life in that matter. His goals were always deceitful, malevolent and greedy. He never received even an ounce of love in his entire life and all he ever wanted was for his father and for his sister to love him. He never deeply wanted anything more than that. It's heartbreaking and the acting that Phoenix applies to this intricate and lonely soul is absolutely astounding and just beautiful. My words can't merely express enough how great of an act Phoenix puts on.8.5/10.","

I'm perfectly sure he can write an excellent score but he has been hiding that virtue for a very long time. I'm almost convinced that Mr. Ridley Scott let Mr. George Lucas take the honor's. The characters are quite as flat as they are on Star Wars 1 2 and 3. Even cinematography makes you squirm. Zoom in on a actor while he is monologuing? That hasn't been done since the 70ties and was dealt with there and than. Both Ben Hur and Spartacus were done over 40 years ago and were more convincing and better acted.

"Indy-52","4 June 2001","GLADIATOR is a fantastic achievement in modern filmmaking. I never expected to ever see another Roman epic, but Ridley Scott has proved it is possible. What's so great about this movie is that it has a really entertaining and enthralling storyline, not just special effects and action (although it has a lot of that): it knows how to make us care about the people in it and how to develop a sense of style and elegance (thanks to director Ridley Scott). The movie is fueled by a number of powerhouse performances: Russell Crowe is perfect as the title character, I loved Oliver Reed as Proximo, and Joaquin Phoenix made a perfectly hissable villain. I was amazed at how exciting this movie was. Although the opening battle sequence is not very promising, with its confusing, chaotic editing, after that it's just uphill: the film will send you on roller-coaster ride of nonstop thrills. The effects are very well done: there is a scene where we see Commodus arrive at Rome as the new emperor that's absolutely breathtaking. I also loved the way they recreated the Colosseum. Parts of this movie are truly awe-ispiring. The fights in the arenas are spectacularly sensational. I must also mention John Mathieson's absolutely beautiful cinematography and Hans Zimmer's perfect music score. Some scenes where Mathieson's visuals and Zimmer's music mix are undescribably beautiful and breathtaking. The entire film is beautiful: just about any frame of it would make a really good poster to stick on the wall. I recommend this film to those who appreciate to finest things in life.","

"Flagrant-Baronessa","26 August 2006","""They tell me your son squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross. And your wife moaned like a whore when they ravaged her again and again... and again.""Gladiator is an amazing story of revenge. It is a story of one man's struggle to challenge the emperor of Rome, wearing nothing but slaves' attire, being sold as a gladiator for the people's morbid amusement, and seeking vengeance for having his family murdered through these 'games'. It is also a political story about justice in the midst of corruption, interwoven with swords, sandals and battlefields á la epic war saga. This, my friends, is a true underdog story with a hero so poignant that it is impossible not to be engrossed in his struggle.Whatever _I_ will say about this film will simply be semi-coherent, rambling praise as I like the works of Ridley Scott so much. However, far from everyone liked Gladiator (2000). Roger Ebert disliked it. Moviegoers criticized it for being unoriginal  a mild rip-off of Spartacus (1960) and the likes. It may have been warmly received by the Academy, but audiences were very divided when it was released. I'd like to think that I am usually able to see things from other people's perspective, but just this once, how could you not be entertained?So although I usually trust Roger Ebert a great deal, I have absolutely no idea what he was on about in panning the film for its gloomy tone and ""muddy, fuzzy and indistinct"" skies. Maybe he simply forgot to clean his widescreen TV, because the Gladiator I know sees hugely epic games under a brilliant blue sky in the coliseum, a glorious tournament that is so entertaining because of its flair. The final battle has ROSES RAINING FROM THE SKY! It does not get more vivid or colourful than that.These battle-scenes of Gladiator are, of course, extremely well tended to by Ridley Scott who is the master at crafting epic war scenarios (see, I told you fanboy-praise would sneak its way in!). The patient, slow pacing of the film seems to take a sudden halt here, and then fast-forward in an amazingly rapid-fire pace with quick shots, swinging swords, vivid skies and a great score by Hans Zimmer to further emphasize the dramatic mood. The very culmination of this is not at the end, but rather early. It is the moment that Maximus (a superb Russell Crowe) removes his helmet, reveals his identity and faces the emperor, after a long and ferocious battle. It is a scene so poignant that I always wish it would have been saved until later on in the film, thereby giving it even more weight. But no matter, because rest assured that it is goosebumps-inducing enough.A gloriously entertaining, heartfelt and carefully crafted war adventure by Ridley Scott in which little feels missing or incomplete. What more could you ask for? Great acting from the cast, I suppose  well, this is also present in Gladiator. Best of all, the actors have good dialogue to work with so they don't choke on the dated lines. Russell Crowe propels this film with his heroic personality, Connie Nielsen adds introspective depth, and Joaquin Phoenix is excellent as the twisted but idealist emperor Commodurus. 9/10","

"kevin142","20 October 2005","The old Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius wanted to give the power to his favorite general Maximus. Due to envy, Commodus killed his father Marcus and claimed him as the lawful successor. The misfortune fell on Maximus. After he lost his family, he did not want to live anymore. However life did not go on as he wanted. He was trained as a gladiator. It mattered life and death. If you wanted to survive, you had to kill the opponent.The final duel between Maximus and Commodus was the most soul-stirring duel I ever watched. Although Maximus was a powerful general, he was a kind and generous person. It was his kindness that made him become the victim of insidious Commodus. Maybe he was just fit for leading an army.Russell Crowe convincingly played the brave general Maximus. He was deserved to win the best actor (the academy award). It was a pity that Ridley Scott did not win the best director.A movie that can push you forward. 9/10","

"Gordon-38","21 June 2000","I absolutely love Ridley Scott.  ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" both rank among my favorite films.  ""Gladiator,"" though, just didn't work for me.Russell Crowe is a fantastic actor, and really ought to be a big, big, big star.  Unfortunately, he's not given much to do here.  He fights, he broods, he whines...but he's never really forced to stretch his talents.My main quibble, I suppose, is that the movie was clearly going for ""Braveheart"" effect, and it fails.  It was easy to get some sympathy going for Mel Gibson's character in ""Braveheart.""  He was fighting for freedom and justice.  Sadly for ""Gladiator,"" it's pretty hard to develop much sympathy for any particular faction within the Roman empire.  Where ""Braveheart"" was able to give us a few effective hallucinations and dream sequences, ""Gladiator"" shoves it down our throat with oddly-colored, tripping-on-acid dream sequences every five minutes.  Yes, we get the point.  He misses his family, and he'll see them in the afterlife.  Move on already!Apart from the dream sequences, the movie does look pretty spectacular.  The Colliseum is an impressive sight.  The costumes, for once in a sword-and-sandal epic, don't look like the costume department simply raided the bedding department at K-Mart.  And the fight scenes are, indeed, entertaining and visceral.In the end, though, the movie is less than the sum of its parts.","

"EugeneandSasha","1 November 2005","Gladiator is the best epic war film. Gladiator has the best war scenes I've ever scene. Better than Troy and much better than Alexander. I liked the digital effects in Gladiator. Troy and Alexander are pretty fun to watch, but in Alexander, i really want to forward it to exciting scenes, like war sequences. Gladiator, I can just sit there and watch it, because if you miss a part, you won't get it. The end was great, i really liked it. It was the best fight scene at the end. Every part kept me interested and there wasn't one part that bored me. It had one of the best endings ever. So if your tired of crappy, imitating war movies go to this one it's the best there is.10/10","

"daveisit","22 January 2001","""Gladiator"" was too long which ensured it to be quite often very boring. What really bothers me is how overrated ""Gladiator"" is, upholding the tradition of all the modern day epic's. The simple minds of so many today fail to realize how uninspiring this movie was. It stuns me how audiences believe a movie is good when it's running time exceeds 150 minutes.""Gladiator"" wasn't awful, however it got very close.","

"bluzman","25 February 2001","Gladiator is well-made and sports all the frills of a big budget production -- big sets and lotsa extras in good costumery.  However, let's be blunt, it is a 10-minute plot stretched out to epic proportions.  And, it is not a new plot.  It is not much more than a combination of Braveheart and Last of the Mohicans, go to Rome -- to name a couple of more recent films. In effect, it is hero gets done wrong and his loved ones are killed, so he bides his time and gets his revenge. I think all of the hurrah behind this film is from Hollywood having little else to offer this year at the Oscars (how else could Chocolat get nominated --$$$). Since Crouching Tiger is not part of the good ole boy Hollywood network, Hollywood is working hard to prevent a foreign film from upstaging them. In a different year, this film would not get half the recognition it is getting.","

"goha","18 July 2007","There is not an ounce of verisimilitude in this entire film. Instead of dialogue between characters, everybody pontificates. Secondary characters don't act, they just stand around staring blankly in the background. Cardboard cutout blatantly CGI Rome. Disembodied fake cheering crowds in the arena. Bombastic music masking dramatic vacuum. Ridley editing like his tourette-suffering brother Tony Scott. Everything is fake, the story has no message. Killer kills as soldier. Killer kills as gladiator. Killer kills Emperor. That's it ! Art direction triumphs over realism.Spartacus is not just twice as good a film, or even ten times better. It's simply a different class of movie in every single aspect of film making.","

"mahen1","10 March 2005","Poignant and evocative as this movie is, no way should it have been best picture. The story is too thin, the script lacks sufficient sophistication. Marcus Aurelius to Maximus'give Rome back to the people it belongs'. Way too vague and general a statement the like of which is repeated too often.Mind you this is a good film, powered by Crowe and the fabulous music of Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer. Gerrard's voice in the dream sequences is fantastic. Crowe has great presence. His Maximus is tired of fighting even before the fighting begins at the beginning of the film. The look on his face at the beginning says it all - a man duty bound to his orders, yet tired and sad at the nature of his duty, yet confident in his own ability and that of his soldiers to carry them out. Crowe retains his tortured tough guy look right the way through.As impressive as the action sequences are at the beginning in the German forest and later in the colosseum, the film looks way too grainy. It's alright for the early sequences where the forest is supposed to be dark and gloomy anyway, but Rome should have been more light and clarity. Special effects and art direction in this sense are a let down.The supporting cast is not given much to work with by the weak script. Derek Jacobi has almost nothing to do, Joaquin Phoenix's villain is just way too one dimensional (not really the actor's fault). Connie Nielsen easily stands out as Maximus' ex-love.I think it's the powerful emotions aroused by the Gerrard-Zimmer music and Crowe's screen presence which propelled this to best picture status. The story and script are just too weak to merit it. Ridley Scott doesn't make bad films, but the visual weaknesses of the film in parts prevent him being praised too much for this effort. He has enough good films under his belt anyway.","

"movieandtvfanatic","14 March 2010","Some movies manage to split the public and critics' opinions right down the middle but still manage to do well at the box office and get tons of awards notice and high ratings. ""Gladiator"" is one of the biggest examples of this, and I am in the camp that finds this to be a weak film.2000 was fairly weak year for movies, but this isn't an excuse for ""Gladiator"" winning the Best Picture Oscar. You still had great films that were completely snubbed like ""Almost Famous"" (my choice), Billy Elliot, Cast Away, Wonder Boys, and among the nominees, Traffic. These films represented the few glimmering moments of film in 2000.Gladiator has actually grown on me with repeated viewings but it is still by no means a great or even good movie. I feel that Russell Crowe did not deserve the Oscar over his entire category and while I am not a huge fan of him as an actor or from what his persona perceives, he did give good performances in ""L.A. Confidential"", ""Romper Stomper"", ""The Insider"", and ""Cinderella Man"" and these went relatively unnoticed (save for ""The Insider""). The movie just didn't feel like a Best Picture winner either. It had all of the right ingredients but it came out stale and bland.","

"jackjack-2","3 June 2001","Many critics blasted this film yet Hollywood fell in love it. Because of the critics I did not watch it until it was shown on HBO. I was appalled with its historical inaccuracy.Basically, Russell Crowe plays the role of a General in the Roman Army under the Roman Emperor Ceaser Marcus Aurelius, who many historians consider as one of the greatest Roman emperors. Marcus died while in Germany in 180 AD. His son, Commodus became the full emperor and made peace with the Germans.
It is at this point that the movie departs from history. In the movie, just befor Marcus Aurelius died he was going to appoint his successor. The fact is that he appointed Commodus co-emperor in 177 AD, three years before he died.The movie makes the point that Marcus Aurelius had no confidence that his son was suitable to be emperor. That much is true and the movie asserts that he tried to appoint someone else to succeed him. That is untrue. If he considered Commodus unfit to rule, why did he make him co-ruler? Because if he hadn't, under Roman custom, his son had to die if he was not made the successor.The story gets more bizarre as it goes on. Russell Crowe escapes execution by Commodus and his family is slain by Commodus, who does not know that Crowe is not dead. As cruel as Commodus is, it is unlikely he would have killed the family of Crowe. It would have served no purpose. In the process Crowe becomes a slave gladiator and winds up in Rome fighting as a gladiator before Commodus. So highly unlikely.I won't give you the ending but it is pure fiction. However, I will tell you what really happened. In 182 Commodus' sister Lucilla conspired with a group of senators to assassinate him. The plot failed, and Commodus retaliated by executing a number of leading senators. Thereafter, his rule became increasingly arbitrary and vicious. In 186 he had his chief minister executed in order to appease the army; three years later he allowed the minister's successor to be killed by a rioting crowd. Political influence then passed to the emperor's mistress and two advisers.Meanwhile, Commodus was lapsing into insanity. He gave Rome a new name, Colonia Commodiana (Colony of Commodus), and imagined that he was the god Hercules, entering the arena to fight as a gladiator or to kill lions with bow and arrow. Finally, when Commodus announced that he would assume the consulship on Jan. 1, 193, dressed as a gladiator, the public became incensed. On Dec. 31, 192, his advisers had him strangled by a champion wrestler.","

"inspectors71","7 December 2005","And Ridley Scott ain't Stanley Kubrick! Scott's sort-of remake of the modestly brilliant and richly emotional Spartacus and the horrendously bad Fall of the Roman Empire is a visually breathtaking epic that has almost no soul. I can't think of a reason to watch this movie other than to be entertained by three hours of close up violence, dazzling computer graphics, Russell Crowe's manliness, Connie Nielsen's loveliness, and Joaquim Phoenix's pree-versions.Done with the movie? You've got nothing to show for it.I don't worry too much about the myriad historical inaccuracies, such as the Roman Republic being reestablished at the end of Gladiator or Marcus Aurelius being murdered (if you have a clue about Roman history, you've just got to grin and bear it), but it's the reliance on the razzle-dazzle of the computer over the emotional depth of the characters that wears Gladiator down and leaves it bleeding in the center of the arena. The opening battle in Germany is eye-popping (and stomach-turning) in its recreation of a fight between Crowe's legion and a pack of Teutonic mouth-breathers. You're supposed to be impressed and hooked, but then the internecine backstabbing, betraying, and incestuous hanky-pankying start and you're left waiting for the next trip into some North African arena where you can watch people get disemboweled in the same grainy fashion as in Saving Private Ryan.It's all very appealing at a lizard-at-the-bottom-of-the-brain pan level (When I saw Gladiator in a theater in Ontario, Oregon, I heard a kid complaining, ""When are we gonna see her (Nielsen) naked?""). Front-load the gore and the kink, dazzle the viewer with recreations of the Roman world, and you don't need to get past Russell Crowe's growling and Phoenix's fussy sickness.Gladiator is emotionally empty. Stick with Kubrick's slave revolt.","

"repulsion","17 December 2000","The denizens of the Roman Empire were a particularly bloodthirsty lot, and apparently not that far off in mentality from our own culture. The vox populi, bored to the heavens with the multitudinous burdens inflicted on them by their government, seek escape in the mind-numbingly bland entertainment provided within the Colosseum. Gladiators fend for their lives against a series of uniquely dressed foes and beasts, all in the hope of winning their freedom. Everything about this testosterone-toned epic is meant to cater to a population who likes their filmed landscapes served to them WWF-style.Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a top army general in the army of Marcus Auerlius (Richard Harris), a dying patriarch who (in predictable fashion) unwittingly causes trouble within the family ranks by offering his throne to Maximus instead of to his son Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix). Auerlius' son is the kind of whinny, pussy-whipped boy that your audience likes to hate because the character's moral fiber makes the character so easily expendable. Commodus' temper tantrums lead to patricide and the film turns into an interminably messy three-hour affair simply centering on the standard theme of revenge.Maximus is sent to die in the woods but manages to get the upper hand and kill Commodus' henchmen. He returns to his homestead only to find his wife and son lynched from trees. Poor Maximus is denied the throne of Rome and is now being fueled to wage a one-man war against the sissy who wiped away his entire family. As Maximus works his way back to Rome, unbeknownst to the new king Commodus, our foppish king swishes around the kingdom ridiculously hitting on his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielson) and hovering inappropriately over his nephew Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark).In the first hour Ridley Scott has expertly painted his archetypal figures, forcing us to love the brave Maximus, wifeless and sonless, and hate the creepy teenager with the thirst for forbidden fruit. Maximus, once back in Rome, manages to enter a gladiator troop manned by one Proximo, the late Oliver Reed. This little group of circus freaks will provide Maximus with the proper cover through which he can maneuver himself into the hearts of Rome's people. Not only is the man driven by revenge but he is also cocky enough to believe that he has what it takes to accomplish the sort of feats no other gladiator has been able to accomplish. By his side is Juba (Djimon Hounsou), the proverbial Black voice of wisdom. If not for Will Smith's more unfortunately stereotypical role in Legend of Bagger Vance, this would have been the kind of role that would have garnered the deserved scorn of people like Spike Lee.For two hours, Scott inundates us with endless arena fireworks that would serve the acrobatics of the Rock and Hulk Hogan to a much better effect. The characterization of Crowe's character amounts to nothing more than a cocksure man, full of false bravado, whose only apparent skill is to raise his arm into the air and scream for his men to surge into battle. He is the kind of screen character who wages war against hundreds of foes within the course of a movie and manages to dispose of all of them with relative ease. He is also the kind of superhero archetype that garners the admiration of young boys like Lucius, something which causes our dear Commodus to go even further over the edge.Scott is to be admired in the end for at least not being a hypocrite, as he practices what he preaches. Since the citizens of Rome seem only to live for bloodlust, Scott manages to paint Gladiator as nothing else than that: entertainment geared for audiences whose sole interest is seeing men and tigers beat the s**t out of each other for three hours. But if this is all there was to the film then one would see little complaints from my person but Scott makes the mistake of filling his film with arty flourishes.The film opens with Maximus walking across a field, his hands slowly caressing tall blades of grass. These flashbacks, along with various cutaways to fast-moving skyscapes, amount to nothing more than pretentious attempts to add artistic credibility to an otherwise sophomoric film. Its as if he is aware of the fact that his film is devoid of any three-dimensional resonance that he tries to quickly interject soft touches of humanity into the proceedings. The end result is nothing less than visual illiteracy, ringing completely false and cowardly.When it comes to epics none come better than Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev or Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, two masterworks from Russia's greatest directors that fully captured the three-dimensional scope of war. The bad guys in these films, unlike the one played by Phoenix in Gladiator, are the kinds of foes whose selfishly malicious journeys are never cartoonishly drawn. The landscapes created by the Russian masters were poetic and grand, full of visual and emotional urgency. Scott's film is amounts to nothing more than being beat over the head by a club for three hours.","

"Bob A-2","27 August 2000","Finally saw Gladiator. Now that's guilty pleasure. Definitely a guy movie, as men outnumbered women three to one in audience. Star Wars, popular as it was, made the mistake of actually being about something; I'm happy to say that Gladiator has no redeeming value whatever. Just blood, mud and crud. Some of the killing made me laugh out loud, like when Crowe stabbed a guy with two swords and then chopped off his head while he was still standing. When Oliver Reed went into that monologue, accompanied by full orchestra, about the thrill of the cheering crowd I almost thought he was going to sing There's No Business Like Show Business. You know something is a bit over the top when one of the most restrained performances comes from Richard Harris! Another big laugh was when Crowe and Djimon win the crowd over by becoming the first ""tag team"" gladiators in pre-television history. Film pictures all the gladiators as united against some unnamed enemy over on the other side of the arena, thus daintily skirting the more Spartacus-like reality that the gladiators fought and killed each other -- and therefore, presumably, were hard put to have indulged themselves in the kind of emotional ties we see here. When the leading lady (Connie Nielsen, in fact just about the only woman) arranges to meet Crowe privately, she explains for the audience's sake that patrician women purchased sexual favors this way all the time. Seems to me everybody onscreen would know that already! It's like in The Mikado where Yum Yum turns halfway toward the audience and says to Nanky Poo ""But darling, you forget: in Japan..."" except that in the latter case WS Gilbert meant it as a joke. The one thing that dampened the pace was long dialogue scenes between the battles, as if the movie were hunting desperately for some intellectual point that would justify its existence, not unlike the '63 Cleopatra in that way. Unnecessary in either case, serving only to protract the running time. Gladiator should be at least a half hour shorter than it is. Audience ate it up, though.A friend commented ""Gladiator will live on TNT and USA forever!"" but I think she underestimates basic cable: there will probably also be a series starring Lorenzo Lamas.","

"searchanddestroy-1","15 August 2023","As Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott rose during the seventies with two masterpieces: DUELLISTS and ALIEN. Spielberg, JAWS, DUEL, ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.... Both were then rather young to bring such jewels. Scott is ten years older than his ""opponent"" but both have in common to continue, after all those decades, to provide regularely other masterpieces, and both have made around 30-35 movies, and for both of them - again- NAPOLEON film for Scott and mini series for Spielberg are also in their calendar. So GLADIATOR is a milestone for the sword and sandal - peplum - genre. Because the last ones were the Italian - and some American - productions from the early sixties, and as far as I know, there were not since. It was a kind of films totally forgotten from the bulk of audiences; but not the die hard movie goers, of course. This movie is unique, awesome, outstanding and opened the way, a boulevard, to many others: TROY,300 being the most widely known. The new, young audiences then discovered what their elders loved when they - youngest - were not even born. Ridley Scott resurrected the sword and sandal film genre with this one. And many sequences - particularely the hand of Russel Crowe touching the wheat field, was taken in at least one hundred other films and even commercials. Scott came from commercials business, during the seventies. Maybe this explains that.","

"jiefengf","2 September 2020","A classic movie successfully portrays a set of intensive characters in a relatively simple plot. The macho and valiant hero Maximus played by Crowe a man worshiped by his people. The beautiful and resourceful Lucilla by Nielsen a loving mother and the true continuation of the spirit of her father. And the envious and serpentine Commodus by Phoenix. The delicious portrayal of these characters creates a classical but still rich dynamics that for me is the main dish of this movie.In addition to this classicality of the plot and the characters, I appreciate the slightly heavy stroke on Commodus. This leads us to explore the natural question of what this man of jealousy is thinking. It's a man who yearns for respect and love of his father and his sister, all of which the mighty general has taken away from him. He seeks no power or fortune, but the name, which the enslaved Maximus claims so easily. This extra colour on the character of Commodus is like the shadow of the painting. A minor change, a huge enhancement.The story is complete. As I am not very knowledgable about neither the history of Rome nor the book, for me, the plot is still able to create a noticeable and constant tension that keeps me intrigued till the end. The ending is actually a little surprising, as I expected a realistic ending of tragedy. This ending, while emotionally pleasing, is a bit cliche. But then, the revelation of such ending reminds me that the move is about a poetic story. I don't feel this clicheness deal much damage to my experience to it.The friends Maximus make when enslaved as gladiator are not completely great. I cannot make a clear point on it. But I feel some of the strokes on these characters are not aesthetic enough and their purpose seems too obvious. This breaks the fluency and the naturalness of the story development. These characters should not bear so much personal emotions with Maximus.All in all, a great entertainment. An epic with strong characters. A story simple and beautiful. Flaws are not unnoticeable, but forgivable.","

"Bob-45","26 June 2000","I wanted to like GLADIATOR, I really did.  My sister said it was a great movie, and I really wanted to please my sister.  But I can't, you see, because GLADIATOR is not a great movie.  In fact, GLADIATOR is not even a particularly good movie.GLADIATOR is ineptly directed by  Ridley Scott; no two ways about it.  What else can explain keeping scenes in which the otherwise competent Russell Crowe lets his Australian accent slip through?  What else Can explain allowing leading lady Connie Nielson sleepwalk through her performance for two thirds of the Movie?  What else can explain carefully crafting a subplot involving a German Shepherd dog, then abruptly dropping it?  The ineptitude goes on and on.  The lack of chemistry between Crowe and Nielson is bad enough without further undercutting it with obtrusive, inappropriate music in early key scenes.  High- and low-key cinematography is intermixed without any concern for dramatic appropriateness.  It is almost as though Scott said, `Cloudy day? No problem, the audience won't notice.'  And lets talk about this cinematography.  Many of the low-key interiors with Joaqin Phoenix and Connie Nielson are so poorly lit, you cannot see Phoenix's eyes!  Poor Phoenix, probably the least experienced of the leads, has the toughest role.  Despite what you may hear, Phoenix does pretty well, despite Scott's undercutting.  ACTION FANS BE WARNED. Scott shoots ALL the action scenes without benefit of long shot (for perspective) and with computer generated and slow-motion action.  Think widescreen movie being shown in television (3:4) format.  Expect to be more confused than entertained.There IS plenty to like in GLADIATOR.  The late Oliver Reed as the gladiator owner is magnificent.  Richard Harris is very good as Marcus Aurelius. Djimon Hounsu, Derek Jacobi, David Schofield, Sven Ole-Thorsen and, especially,  Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) are all fine in supporting roles. Savor them if you must see GLADIATOR.","

"paulclaassen","2 February 2021","'Gladiator' is a spectacle of note and a film everyone should see at least once. Jealousy, ambition, greed, betrayal, loyalty, and vengeance are all so well illustrated here. It is an excellent script and very well executed.Russell Crowe is good as Maximus, a man who lost everything in the blink of an eye. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the antagonist, Commodus. Commodus is the epitome of a true villain. You will hate him. The film features all round good performances from a seasoned cast.Despite the film's long running time, it is never boring. From the impressive opening battle scene to the climatic finale, it is action and intrigue all the way. However, due to the film's theme, there's a lot of bloody and violent killings, hence the film can be grim and depressing at times.Ultimately, though, 'Gladiator' is a fantastic tale of vengeance. The photography is beautiful and the sweeping score is filled with so much emotion. Despite plenty of brutality, 'Gladiator' is still an absolutely beautiful film.","

"Prichards12345","3 April 2010","I have to admit I'm somewhat puzzled by the highly-marked reviews and Oscars dished out to this movie. I watched this on Blue-Ray for the first time yesterday, and my partner really enjoyed it - she'd give it two marks higher. Me, I found it occasionally good, overlong, treacle-paced, with a lot of one dimensional characters and stock situations. And a horrible, stupid ending.Gladiator follows the exploits of General Maximus (Russell Crowe), successful military commander, being betrayed by Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix), who usurps his Roman Emperor father Marcus Arelius (Richard Harris). Finding his family brutally murdered, Maximus is captured by slavers who sell him to a Gladiator school run by former Gladiator Proximo (Oliver Reed) And from here Maximus sees a chance to avenge the murder of his family.In truth the movie is rather far-fetched but with some stirring combat sequences. The opening battle in Germania is not particularly well-staged (Cavalry charge through a forest?) I have to admit I found the chief merit in the film to be the performances of some of the actors. Richard Harris and Oliver Reed are excellent, as is Joaquin Pheonix, who unfortunately appears to be acting in a different movie from everyone else. He gives a sensitive portrayal of a descent into madness (never once does he go over the top) but the film is really crying out for a black-hat villain, and is weakened overall by the character of Commodus. You feel the senate would usurp him easily, and the Roman political scenes are hopelessly inadequate in capturing the spirit of Rome.Russell Crowe is extremely dull and wooden in the part of Maximus, and I can only assume that Oscars are awarded largely on the strength of studio campaigns. Crowe himself has given much better performances. The music is also a very clichéd variation on Mars The Bringer Of War.So, if you don't expect too much you might like it. To me it's far from a great movie. Ridley Scott has made many better films.","

"ElMaruecan82","30 April 2017","In 2003, the American Film Institute presented the Top 100 Screen-Characters, fifty each in the hero and villain category, with the fiftieth spots belonging to the most recent characters: Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) from ""Training Day"" was the last bad guy and in the heroic department: General Maximum Decimus Meridius, Russel Crowe as the titular 'Gladiator'. His reputation outgrew ""Training Day"" and deservedly so, as the film not only resurrected the 'swords and sandals' genre but a new trend of spectacular entertainment that defined film-making of the new millennium.Like Jesus Christ in the Antiquity timing, there would be a before and an after ""Gladiator"" and like Caesar, one's got to give Ridley Scott the credit he deserves. He didn't use CGI for the sake of special effects but for storytelling, it was still the post-""Titanic"" era where CGI was used for the sinking, but the rest was made of flesh, props and bones, ""The Phantom Menace"" had CGI as vital as the actors, maybe more, but Scott used them to recreate the Coliseum, to make the cheerful crowds look real, to transport us into a universe that had deserted screens ever since the 60's: Antique Rome, as if its historical fall had spread to Hollywood. The use of CGI isn't perfect but it is the job of the story to distract your eyes and mind so that you won't try to spot the flaw, and speaking for myself, I was so enthralled by the story that I didn't even want to spot any flaw.Indeed, the real power of ""Gladiator"" is in the story, one of disconcerting simplicity, whose pitch could take indeed the time of an elevator ride but the treatment and the performances enrich it with a Shakespearian texture. You can say it's a story of an ambitious son who kills his father, Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) to prevent him from restoring the power to the people, but the performance of Joaquin Phoenix is of a dark, brooding and twisted man who can't stand the paternal rejection and surrenders to the reality of his own wickedness and commits the irreparable act. You can almost feel Commodus killing a part of himself with his father, the only shade of goodness left in his heart. If he can't rule because he's too amoral, so be it, and let's start a descent that will go as far as turning the victor of the Barbarians into a mortal enemy.Yes, I started with the villain, but it's the villain that gives its flavor to the film, and Commodus encompasses such a high degree of corruption that he inevitably highlights the straight morality of Maximus, his father's most faithful lieutenant, the son he wished he had. Oscar-winning Russell Crowe plays the general with enough depth and passion to be as believable as Mel Gibson when he played William Wallace (Gibson was the initial choice) but the real power of Crowe is to keep a low profile, never overplay the heroism figure, he's a man not guided by power or ambitions, freed from any corrupting torment, his only wish is to get back to his home near Trujillo. His moral 'cleanness' creates the perfect balance with a villain whose mind is clouded by hatred, Maximus seems ""one-dimensional"" because we relate to him as a good father and a good son while we're more captivated by the back-story of Commodus. The Emperor's last line ""your faults as a son are my failure as a father"" are the kind of lines Shakespeare might have been proud to write.There are elements of ""Julius Caesar"" and ""Spartacus"" but the resulting mix is unique and a standalone classic served by powerful performances, Connie Nielsen is the sister of Commodus and Maximus' previous mistress, and Oliver Reed makes his final performance as Proximo, the slave merchant and former gladiator who starts to respect Maximus as he realizes his value and encourages him to ""win the crowd"" as the only way to earn his freedom. Maximus couldn't care much about freedom, his only wish is to avenge his family and join them in the afterlife, a secret he shares with his fellow slave, a Numidian played by Djimon Hounsou. The films covers many layers from spectacular entertainment to its arousing story and while not being totally accurate, it is engaging in every department and captures the essence of movies as an art of storytelling and spectacle, using special effects, even to recreate a heart-pounding fight with a tiger, something meant not to be noticed.And all the special effects of the world wouldn't have a point if we didn't care for the characters in the first place.The film is known for having been severely bashed by Roger Ebert himself, I read his review and I got some of his points about the fuzzy and muddy look, and yes, there might have a few abuse of the bluish American light, but there's a scene that can summarize my feeling. When Maximus is encouraged by the crowd to kill one of the gladiator, he's popular already, he earns the respect of the crowd but when he spares the fighter, there's a hesitation, some of the audience boos but it then turns into cheers again as he's called ""Maximus the Merciful"".When you win the crowd, whatever you do will look good, I guess whatever Scott did could pass, his film, along with the Best Picture Oscar of the year, had won the crowd as well, and deserves a special nod as one of the most defining and influential movies of the 2000's. Or well, let's just say ""I was entertained"" to the point I didn't want to spot any visual flaw. That's how good it is.","

"prestocito","9 March 2021","I have been waiting for years to watch this movie. My dad never let me because it was rated r and I wasn't old enough. i finally turned 15 and he let me watch it. Very very good movie. If only my dad let me watch it unedited with all the violence it probably would be even better. I keep telling my dad I can handle the violence and I am not a scared little boy, and he edited out like all of the bloody fighting. And what is crazy is that we watched The Patriot (2000) and he edited like nothing. We saw almost everything from that movie. Ive heard that movie was more violent than this one. Whatever.
I still loved it even though almost all of the violence was cut out from my dad. The plot was really good and the quotes are really memorable. Can't wait till im older and I leave my dads house and watch this with all the violence. But till then i will have to say this was a great movie even though it would probably be better with the violence","

"Bernie4444","29 November 2023","What do you do when everything that could be done in a gladiator movie has been done? And the script is right out of the old Charles Bronson revenge movies for having family unjustly dispatched by the evil authority. There can never be another, ""Ben-Hur"" (1959), a movie made in its time, for its time, and an untouchable classic.This gladiator movie is for today's audience and may someday become a classic. Instead of having a splashy image like John Wayne, Russell Crowe has to blend in with the movie and the story. He must be ruthless and compassionate almost at the same time.Of course, if you just concentrate on Russell Crowe, you will miss many other great actors, not the least of which is Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus. You can see him again as Brother Cadfael in ""A Morbid Taste for Bones"".What is this? The new Roman Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). See Joaquin again as Johnny Cash in ""Walk the Line.""Although there is quite a substantial amount of displayed hemoglobin, this is not the main purpose of the movie. And I guarantee that you will be glued to the set without even realizing it.","

"Thanos_Alfie","14 March 2021","""Gladiator"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we watch a man seeks revenge from the Roman emperor who set the murder of his family and tried to kill him too. He has to find a way to approach the emperor and be ready to take his revenge.I liked this movie very much because it had an amazingly interesting plot that kept me in tense through its whole duration and the direction which was made by Ridley Scott was simply outstanding. The interpretation of Russell Crowe who played as Maximus was iconic and I believe that he did an excellent job. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Joaquin Phoenix's who played as Commodus, Richard Harris' who played as Marcus Aurelius and Djimon Hounsou's who played as Juba. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Gladiator"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that you will be amazed by it.","

"gogoschka-1","27 March 2019","GLADIATOR is a masterpiece of polished pulp Cinema with all the right ingredients: visceral fights and battles; a beautiful, mysterious woman; a villain you love to hate and a hero with a code of honor (and arms like tree trunks); it has all the drama and heartbreaking betrayals and tragic deaths of a Telenovela and as much blood and testosterone as you'd find in a Rambo movie. It's simply glorious, spectacularly entertaining filmmaking - all delivered straight to the gut and without a shred of irony.And boy is this violent revenge tale and journey to ancient Rome beautiful to look at: every shot is framed like a painting; it's one of those gorgeous looking Ridley Scott films where every landscape becomes as much a protagonist of the film as the actors in it. As for those actors, they are never less than magnetic to watch, and especially Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe stand out; they bring an intensity and all-in approach to their roles that garnered them both Oscar nominations (Crowe won his).I sometimes hear the argument by certain self-professed film critics that GLADIATOR is too pulpy to really be considered a good film. I couldn't agree less. This is one rousing adventure and one beautiful movie with a fantastic cast - and it knows exactly what it wants, and it achieves it to a degree of perfection. It's about as cinematic an experience as film can offer, and it's as watchable today as it was nearly 20 years ago.P.S.

"mOVIemAN56","26 March 2005","(Possible Spoilers)Gladiator could be considered the first great movie of the new millennium. It has story, it has history, it has romance, and it has action. But above all else, it has action. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is the leader of Emperor Marcus Aurelius' (Richard Harris) legion in Germany. After a horrific battle to open the film, the Emperor is murdered by his power-hungry son, Commidus (Joaquin Phoenix) and Maximus is sentenced to die. After an amazing escape, Maximus returns home to find his family murdered and home destroyed. Next thing you know he's being sold as a slave to Proximo (Oliver Reed) a gladiator owner. The film is filled with amazing battle sequences held in the arena and a story of revenge that nearly matches Ben-Hur's (1959). Russell Crowe does an excellent job as the betrayed servant of Rome and the ability Joaquin Phoenix shows as a truly insane emperor is amazing. This film has some of the best acting I have ever seen. The film won (If memory serves me right) numerous awards and gratitude from critique's. The Colliseum is a tad to big compared to its actual size yet the director is still able to show how advance the Roman's were when it came to construction, battle tactics, and government. The look of Roman society is a bit off but it does not matter as that is not the focus of the film.Gladiator. Starring: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielson, and Oliver Reed. 5 out of 5 Stars.","

"athena24","19 August 2005","When I saw the movie in the theater for the first time I said it was OK. Not a great movie but worth seeing. Of course this is mainly for the battles that are amazing. And the score to the movie is fair enough. But I had a feeling that there is something wrong with this movie. It seemed that this is a replica of Braveheart. Only in Braveheart I got emotional without wanting it and in Gladiator I wanted to but I couldn't, It just wasn't so. The next time I saw it on DVD I noticed that each time I waited for the fights, because everything else is dumb. The plot unveils in turtle pace, the dialogs are over dramatic, it just like all the characters will burst with tears in minute after they say something. The most annoying thing is the plot itself. The characters look very unrealistic and unconvincing, a lot of time is wasted on unnecessary talk and the end can be predicted from the beginning.Well, a little bit of history for the end. There was an Emperor Marcus Aurelius that was considered as a ""good"" emperor, that ended the era of ""the five good emperors"". His son that succeeded him was Commodus ( just like in the movie ), but he's not killed his father. Marcus Aurelius died from a disease. Commodus himself was an excellent fighter. He fought with his father in the north, and after he became an emperor he tested himself each time in the coliseum arena with the gladiators and the beasts, and won each and every battle. Commodus killed by an athlete called Narcissus in his bath. Commodus considered himself a god and wanted people to think of him the same which can be viewed as insanity but for sure he wasn't weak and Coward as he was portrayed in the movie. He also ruled for 12 years, something that the movie doesn't count for.One commercial movie for Ridley Scott, but definitely one of the dumbest he made ( there is always G.I.Jane for this title ). Go see Alexander. Much closer to history, much better movie.","

"EdgarST","28 May 2001","In the 1960s, Steve Reeves would have killed John Drew Barrymore after 80 minutes (the necessary time to tell such an inane story), and ""The End"" (""Fine"" is more appropriate) would have appeared on the screen, as Reeves kissed Mylène Demongeot, Chelo Alonso or Scilla Gabel in the hereafter. The production would have cost 1/200 of the ""Gladiator"" budget, and you would have left the cinema feeling as silly and empty, but not as cheated, as after seeing this ""white elephant"". Unfortunately, this never-ending melodrama has been hailed as a masterpiece by the lovers of over-amplified sound effects, boringly fake visuals and gratuitous violence; and as in a Roman circus, it has been crowned with awards that make it look worst than it is. They all have shown more inspiration than the filmmakers in tracing a parallel between the Roman empire and the present one. What a shame.","

"Epaminondas","24 January 2005","Russell Crowe's fine performance as an ex-general turned into a slave and then a gladiator cannot save this picture from its utter absurdity, as the ending stages a pathetic duel between him and (no kidding) the Emperor of Rome in the Coliseum!!! There are some impressive scenes in the film, and Crowe has a beautiful screen presence; his friendship with a fellow Numidian gladiator is nicely conveyed, as is his attachment to amulets representing his family; the revelation of his identity is aptly charged with tension; and the preparation of the first battle is superb. Alas, it then turns into an orgy of gore.Being an ancient Greek (Theban to be precise) general, I'm bound to have qualms about this film's treatment of antiquity. As many reviewers have noted, the sole idea of a roman citizen (let alone a general) being turned into a slave is absurd, as is the trip from Germania to Spain during which Crowe seems to pass through some sort of rocky desert before entering the hills of Tuscany... How familiar is the filmmaker with the geography of Europe I wonder? Depictions of power relations in Rome are also quite laughable.But it is the voyeuristic stance and contemporary political relevance of the film which I find most disturbing. The despisal/fascination for the 'mob' which runs through the film has a distinctly fascist tinge. The violence is in some places unbearable, all the more so as it is gratuitous (the slaughter of Maximus' son)... My deep rejection and indeed contempt for the film really developed from listening to Ridley Scott's commentary on the DVD, in which he avows, among other depressing platitudes, that he would really have liked to live in Roman times, granted he was among the wealthy ruling classes... Probably in order to enjoy the spectacle of death and violence he in turn successfully inflicts on his twentieth-century teenage audience. The implications of such a fascination for slavery and violence are frightening, and make one want to watch SPARTACUS over and over again, as a reminder of the times in which Hollywood stood for humanist values, and not their despisal. It is also an opportunity to find where many seemingly novel ideas in GLADIATOR actually originate...All in all, despite how much we want to believe in Crowe, the film is far from the historical and psychological complexity (and visual clarity in battle scenes) of the much-underrated Alexander. Indeed, Crowe would have been perfect in the part, and would probably have had the guts to oppose to the wearing of Colin Farrell's ridiculous blonde wig!","

"Reviews_of_the_Dead","22 August 2022","This is a movie that I originally saw in the theater with my mother and sister when it came out. I believe this would have put Russell Crowe on my radar along with Joaquin Phoenix. That first time seeing this, I loved it. It is one that I've seen since then, but it had been a while. Jaime and I watched this with her parents as well while we were visiting them. This is on our Internet Movie Database poster as well.We follow Maximus (Crowe) as they're fighting the barbarian tribes of Germania. The emperor is Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). He is fond of Maximus and much of this is the time that has been spent on the battlefield. Maximus is a great general. They score a victory and this brings Marcus' children to celebrate, Lucilla (Connie Nielson) and Commodus (Phoenix). Marcus scolds his son and this enrages him, causing him to kill the emperor. Without the knowledge of what happened, Commodus has Maximus branded a traitor and they try to kill him.There are events that happen that land Maximus a slave and owned by Proximo (Oliver Reed). He bought him to compete as a gladiator. Proximo can see the promise that Maximus has. It also leads him back to Rome, known as the Spaniard. Commodus flirts with becoming a dictator and those in the senate do not want that. Corruption is starting in Rome and Maximus could be a tool to fix it.Now while writing this, I did realize something. I didn't know that Marcus and Commodus are real people. I didn't look deeper to see if the events that happened here or real or not, because this feels like it is borrowing from Spartacus. If there is truth here or not, I love this story. We have a revenge story at its core. I'm fascinated by world history where this is set. The gladiator battles are something else that are fascinating to me. There is an interesting commentary here on government corruption that is social relevant as well. You could say that the United States is flirting with this now on both sides. As someone who loves commentary, you have me on board.If you don't care about subtext, we still have good performances. It is funny seeing a man from New Zealand play a Spaniard, but Crowe is good. He has charisma for this role, especially to entertain the audiences. Phoenix is a great villain. Nielsen is good along with Spencer Treat Clark as her son. I also liked seeing Djimon Hounsou as another slave and even Tommy Flanagan. We also get a great cast of older actors here with smaller roles like Reed, Harris, Derek Jacobi, David Schofield, John Shrapnel, Tomas Arana and David Hemmings. Along with the casting, I love the battle scenes. This movie goes brutal with the effects, which I appreciate. There is a gritty and dirty feel to the fighting that feels real. This is a film that holds up after multiple watches in my opinion and I can see why it is sits in the Top 100 on IMDb. Plus, Ridley Scott could direct the heck out of a movie.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.","

"questl-18592","2 December 2021","This right here? Undisputed King of the Modern Day Swords and Sandals genre. It just hits that perfect note of an epic without feeling contrived or over indulgent. Ridley Scott really did something masterful here because I think this film showed an exceptional deft touch in terms of balancing accuracy and legitimacy with the feel of the movie, that emotional resonance that can overwrite some nonsense.Crowe's understated, quiet performance is perfect for Maximus and Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus is just a reminder of how skilled that man is. It's a real Batman/Joker kind of vibe with the stoic hero and the crazy, sadist villain and Phoenix is able to put these layers in there that make Commodus feel so complex and deep. It's something we're missing from a lot of villains these days who are just ""I'm big and bad because... Because!"" Instead he manages to make this character both sniveling and pathetic but also terrifying!After all this praise, it's weird to say that I don't love this movie. It's good, great even but it never quite hit me right. I never mind watching it, but also never really feel like seeking it out. This just happened to be on and I didn't change the channel or stream and wound up watching it and you know what? It's great for that, because it's a good watch.","

"icclyf","19 July 2020","Great Story! Great Writing! Great Acting! Great Directing! Great Score! This movie has it all. I especially enjoyed the mood of the film. Even though it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style. The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations. Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the ""general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor."" Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine. It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla. However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles. Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers. Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo, the trainer for the gladiators. The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the ""thrill of the Coliseum"" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate. The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene. But the whole movie is a rush! Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie. Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing. I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages. Next to Braveheart, this movie is the greatest of all-time!","

"fredrikgunerius","9 August 2023","A sword-and-sandal film of very much classical proportions about power, deceit and tyrannical rule, and how one hero of almost superhuman abilities and goodness rises up against it all and triumphs on behalf of the people. Ridley Scott directs with a command and grandeur befitting a film of this scale, and Russell Crowe in the title role carries the film with a confidence bordering on arrogance reminiscent of Richard Burton in Cleopatra (and with the brilliant Joaquin Phoenix mirroring Roddy McDowall in the same movie). Crowe is oozing of old-fashioned masculinity and star-power, something which in no small part contributes to the film's timeless effect. The action sequences have all the underdoggish, stick-it-to-the-man feel you could ever want.","

"Ripe Peach","3 June 2001","Well, that was a big old damp squib.  The budget and the decent castensure that Gladiator is a competent film, but its by no means a goodone.Sure, there are some genuinely engaging fight sequences, but that's_all_ Gladiator has going for it.  And to be brutally frank, they'renot all that great technically.  Crowe gives it his best shot, but hisopponents have to do a lot of incompetent poses to allow him to chopthem up, and for me that ruins any actual dramatic effect that theaction sequences might have had. The extended conversations are just boring.  The characters are wellacted, but are sketchy and uninvolving, and I just can't bring myselfto care about any of them.  And sure, Maximus has a sad story, but sowould all of his fellow gladiators, yet we don't get to hear themwhining.  Rank apparently does have its priveleges even in the slavepits.Oliver Reed stands out by actually making his character vaguelyintersting, but that's the balanced by the insipid Connie Neilsonwho's utterly mundane and can't decide what accept she's trying toaffect.Gladiator is a waste of budget, time and talent.  It's a greatshame that it was such a success, because it will just encourage morestudios to throw money at similar follies on the basis that no filmwith a budget in excess of 100 million dollars US has ever lost money.","

"ranev","20 January 2002","It's starts out like any good epic should with a masterfully filmed and executed exciting battle sequence that sets up the audience for one of those rare Hollywoodian confections that are both entertaining and artsy. Unfortunately, it all goes downhill from there. It isn't the performers faults since every single one of them give amazing, emotional, even, at times, riveting performances (the kinds you should find in better movies) and who give the whole picture more class than it deserves. It isn't Hanz Zimmer's nor Lisa Gerrard's fault since they have composed a score that's almost (and I do mean almost) as unforgettable as the Godfather's. And it certainly isn't Ridely Scott's fault since he yet again succeeds in immersing the audience in the world he has created. No, the ones who are to blame are the people who wrote the saccharine, clichéd, soap-opery script and who, in the process, have wasted all of this incredible talent. They should be fed to the lions. It's an entertaining B-movie that could have been a classic. Just like Titanic in a way.","

"Maciste_Brother","10 January 2010","As a fan of Peplum films (or Sword & Sandal) and having enjoyed previous films from Ridley Scott, I was surprised by how disappointing GLADIATOR was.The first thing that stood out is how badly shot it was. The DP (and Scott) missed the boat on this one. The film's constant greyish tone was off putting and uninspired. It tries to give the film a realistic look but comes across as forced and in the end more fake than anything else. Because the look of the film wasn't believable, the film's other weaknesses stood out even more, like the acting. Except for Joaquin and the veteran cast, the acting was sub-par. Crowe is monotonous, almost sleepwalking through the entire epic. He can't really be blamed as his character is as one dimensional as possible. He acts like a robot, an unstoppable robot who kills everyone in sight. In one scene, Maximus enters the stadium grounds and proceeds to kill a dozen other gladiators, one after the other, in a single run. The scene is so ludicrous that the reality of the film flew out the window and couldn't get into the predictable story with Maximus reduced to a Roman version of Rambo.The monotonous look of the film also can't camouflage the obvious CGI which today looks even more cardboady than it did 9 years ago. To make things even more tedious, the entire film is a direct rip-off of Anthony Mann's THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, which, albeit wasn't great but at least it respected the intelligence of its audience, unlike GLADIATOR which is the fast food version of history. All of this could have been overlooked had the film been entertaining on some level but the slow pace, ponderous tone and predictable story killed all possibilities for it being entertaining. It's not a fun film at all.In the end, GLADIATOR, which won the Oscar for best picture (it must have been a really bad year), is not even remotely memorable in any way shape or form. Give me a vintage Italian Sword & Sandal flick, like THE REBEL GLADIATORS, before this inert Hollywood production.","

"LeonLouisRicci","5 May 2017","The New Millennium Begins with this ""Time Machine"" Movie that was and has become one of the most Popular, Award Winning Films in Recent History.History is Tweaked by the Journey, 2,000 Years Ago, when Rome was Kicking Ass and Decadent as the Fall of the Empire was Beginning.A Central Theme in Ridley Scott's Blockbuster is Rome's Politics, Corruption and Direction for the Future. But that is Hardly the Thing that Sold this one to the ""Mob"".It's Epic Appeal, mostly done with CGI, was its Bloodletting, Hero/Saviour (the muscled up Russell Crowe), and its Simplistic Display of ""Wrestle-Mania"" Spectacle.Joaquin Phoenix is the Over the Top, Effeminate, Incestuous, Megalomaniac Villain. Connie Nielsen is His Sister with Her Young 8 Year Old Son in Tow that Phoenix uses for Blackmailing Her into Submission.Other Supporting Characters make Mild Impressions. Oliver Reed as a Slave (Gladiator) Trader, Derek Jacobi as a Senator, Djimon Hounsou as Crowe's Token Sidekick, and Richard Harris as the Aging Caesar.Overall, it is a Lazy, Hazy, Sword and Sandal Modernization that has more Pretensions than it can Sustain. Not Taken Seriously it's an Entertaining Oscar Hog that is Overrated but Worth a Watch. The CGI doesn't Hold Up all that well, but in 2000 A.D., it had some Appeal.","

"rebeljenn","28 November 2005","The only good thing that I can say about this film is that it was shot well with careful planning in costume and excellent scenery. I cannot fault the picture/cinematography at all. But, this is the only thing the film has going for it, and this alone cannot save a film.'Gladiator' was over-rated as a classic epic of its time. The story is complex and very dull in many places, and it could have been shortened. Now, I am a big fan of historical fiction films, but this one just did not do it. The story was very weak, and I could not get into it at all. The characters were also another problem. I felt that I could not relate to them. The film is not as engaging - the characters and story are weak so much that none of the great things about this film make a difference. It is too bad because I had some high expectations for this film and the genre.","

"anaconda-40658","8 June 2015","Gladiator (2000): Dir: Ridley Scott / Cast: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris, Oliver Reed: Visually stunning depiction starring Russell Crowe as a gladiator whose life is marked by violence in an ugly fashion of sport. He is framed for murder and sentenced to death but he survives only to discover that his wife and son were crucified and burned. Central plot thrusts him in gladiator games where he spends wasted time hacking up soldiers. Triumphant art direction cannot save repetitious story. Director Ridley Scott successfully creates the era but this is hardly a match for his superior films such as Alien and Blade Runner. Crowe carries the film going from honoured soldier to a fighter placed within a bloody game of survival where only his revenge drives him. Joaquin Phoenix overacts tremendously as Caesar who is basically a cardboard villain destine for death and when it happens, it lacks the intended satisfaction. Wasted appearances by Connie Nielsen and Richard Harris. Oliver Reed even appears as an old gladiator who likely wiped his ass with toilet paper that contained more than what this screenplay does. The art direction and visual elements are in top form. The film reflects the Roman Empire and violent sport to entertain the lust for violence. Unfortunately the repetition and violent exploits of the screenplay render this perhaps the most overrated film of the year. Score: 4 ½ / 10","

"radoii_87","6 February 2014","Summer blockbusters are creatures of their own, aiming to cater to and exploit our lowest desires. Ridley perfectly understands this and consciously tries to redefine them when he gets a chance. Unlike many others, he knows what he is doing and approaches the matter with care instead of force. This works only because of him.We have a movie about a spectacle, in which we and the mob are one and the same. It's cynical as it bashes the industry and us, yet hopeful with its vision for the future. The visual style is novel and somewhat counterintuitive. Typically, one would expect huge cinematic battles, filled with bloodshed, as well as a very architecturally dimensional Rome, filled with pride of its history. Here, these are handed very differently, casually placed in the background. We imagine and deduce them from the eyes of the characters - very subtle, especially for a summer blockbuster. Instead, the focus here is on emotion and tension. Tension between a ""cheap entertainment thrill"" and ""strength and honor"". Judging by how successful this was, new endeavors should learn from it, as it shows that the audience expects something more. Crowe is utilized well here. Some of his scenes with Joaquin carry and project that tension for us to feed on.4/5 - Worth a watch. We've started to demand much more after this.","

"mentalcritic","5 August 2000","Detractors claim this film is a hollow entry in the Roman gladiator genre for the most pedantic of reasons. Nothing could be further from the truth. This film is one of the greatest ever made because it has the power to move people, specifically myself. I don't mean just move me in the same way that Robocop or the Star Wars saga move me by making me see aspects of my past and how I would ideally change them. I mean that Gladiator moves me by making me look at the details of a life that was, and still is to some extent, slowly dragging me down and making me abandon life altogether, and motivating me to make a commitment in the way I deal with it.That commitment? Like Maximus, I realised that I am not ready for my life to be over until I have made something more of it. Maximus could not die until he had transcended the way in which Commodus had victimized him, and liberated Rome from Commodus' inferiority complex that masqueraded as a dictatorship. As I saw this unfold on the screen in front of me, I took the death of my fiancee and the abuse of my past and saw that the future was not set, and I could still make my life something worth living.This alone justifies Gladiator's place in the 250 best films of all time, in spite of its relatively miniscule flaws. Before I die, I want to shake Russell Crowe's hand. His performance as Maximus reduced me to a tearful wreck, and at the same time moved me to do something nothing else could move me to do: let go and move on. I will always owe Crowe and Scott a huge debt for this film, which means more to me than any film I have seen before (more than five thousand, so don't bother arguing with me about it) or probably will in the future.","

"bigverybadtom","12 September 2023","As I mentioned numerous times, movies rarely try to depict accurate history. But if you want a movie that entertains you and even grips you, this works very well.The current emperor is ready to leave the throne, but instead of his son Commodus, whom he finds unfit for becoming the new emperor, he has a victorious general Maximus in mind to become regent. Needless to say, Commodus is not pleased with this, and is further displeased when Maximus refuses to swear loyalty to him.Russel Crowe is great as the heroic Maximus, but Joaquin Phoenix is even better as the villainous Commodus, the cruel, effeminate, childish, treacherous, and perverted villain who Maximus, despite being reduced to having become a gladiator, continuously frustrates Commodus's various nefarious plans, always coming out on top and being cheered by the Roman public, and you cheer as well each time Commodus is thwarted again and again. Never has a movie provided a villain you so dearly love to see pummeled, not with graphic violence but with frustration and humiliation.","

"bbhlthph","9 June 2006","'Gladiator' received numerous awards and has attracted over 2000 largely favourable user comments on IMDb. Although my comments will not be well received by those who regard it as a great film, I believe this is an APPALLING film which should never have been released. A film can be appalling because of bad direction, bad acting, or just plain bad photography - none of these are the problem here. A film can also be appalling because it plagiarises an earlier film too closely without giving any recognition to it, because it is intellectually dishonest, because its contents are antisocial, or because its nature is such that it is highly prejudicial to the film industry as a whole - the last three of these concerns all seem to me to arise with Gladiator. Some IMDb users have expressed concerns about plagiarism - noting its very close structural similarities to 'Braveheart' (1995) and 'Tarkan' (1969), but these are not my concern. When the scenario of a new film is totally different to its predecessor it is hard to justify condemning it for plagiarism.'Gladiator' features exactly the same scenario as the 1964 film 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' which is quite an elegant work that probably deserved to be more successful than it was. But it had one fatal flaw. It was promoted as an historically accurate account of the relatively short historical period when the Roman Empire appears to have undergone a fundamental transformation from an aggressive expansionist would be world empire to a survivalist mode where its main concern became the protection of its existing boundaries. This period, well documented by Gibbon and others, occurred after the death by disease of the stoic Emperor Marcus Aurelius whilst on campaign in A.D. 180. His son Commodus, who had already been co-emperor for three years, assumed full authority at the early age of nineteen with the support of Marcus's trusted advisers, but gradually after four years rule he became increasingly cruel and capricious, showing many signs of insanity, and finally acting in such a way that he was murdered in a palace conspiracy. His successor tried to repair the damage done to the fabric of Roman society but ultimately proved too weak and was murdered in turn, leading to a long period of increasing instability. The highly respected Will Durant was listed as historical consultant for the making of this 1964 film, but his advice was clearly neglected as the film incorrectly showed Marcus rejecting his son as heir to the throne, and his son responding by murdering his father and seizing the throne. Later it showed Commodus killed in the Arena whereas he was in fact drugged and strangled in his palace. Incredibly, this totally fictitious story from the earlier film was repeated in Gladiator. To me this makes the film unacceptable for intellectual dishonesty. We are told it is just a film prepared for entertainment. Fine - BUT ONLY IF IT DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A HISTORICAL FILM. 'The Sign of the Cross', 'Ben Hur', 'Quo Vadis' and 'Caesar and Cleopatra' were promoted as films of literary works not as historical works, and I have no problem with this. But a film has an enormous audience compared with a historical treatise and, if it is thought to be presenting real history, its inaccuracies can be very misleading. Most people who lived through the holocaust have now died and already a concerted campaign, making extensive use of the media to deny that it ever happened, is under way. If public perception of its reality is ever reduced to the status of a largely mythical event, it will severely handicap the chance of humanity learning essential lessons from history. YES, HISTORICAL ACCURACY IS OF IMPORTANCE, certainly in everything except a declared work of fiction.'Gladiator' is also appalling because much of its appeal comes from the graphic killing of one human being by another in the name of sport. The Roman Games started as athletic contests with readings of literature and dramatic presentations, followed quite early by events involving the public punishment and execution of criminals. The latter evolved into gladiatorial contests where criminals who would be useful in the all important Roman armies could redeem themselves; and much later into the staging of public atrocities which sometimes even featured women and children being killed by wild beasts or burned alive. It has taken humanity many hundreds of years to totally reject such 'entertainment' and pogroms of various types still occur in many parts of the world with alarming frequency. The first step towards establishing higher standards is the banning of public executions, but 'Gladiator' makes extensive use of computer generated images which give all the vicarious thrills of watching whilst one person kills another. It also takes a giant step along the slippery slope of virtual reality which could eventually permit viewers to 'experience' actual participation in such events. IS THIS WHAT WE REALLY WANT FROM THE CINEMA? The 1934 Hayes code which crippled the North American film industry for many years resulted from an overwhelming public demand to restrict films that overstepped the bounds of public acceptability. A third reason why 'Gladiator' is an appalling film is that it has pushed the limits of acceptability to the point where there will be demands for some new form of censorship. Today there is more and more emphasis being put on self regulation whether in government or in corporate life. If the film industry cannot face up to its need for some self regulation IT MAY LOSE ITS ARTISTIC FREEDOM AND BE RETURNED TO THE DARK AGES OF EXTERNALLY IMPOSED PRODUCTION 'CODES'.","

"JJohns","28 January 2003","May be a spoiler. Gladiator was a good movie. And no one could have played Maximus' character better than Crowe. It was the fittest and finest he'd ever looked. I loved the lines at the beginning of the film when he says, ""What we do here today echoes in eternity"" or something like that. What can I critique? Performances by everyone was great. The plot was adequate for the epic film and it showed a historical account of men being sold into slavery and turned into warriors for entertainment during the times of Roman rule. It was impressive and I'm not going to pretend like I'm some kind of movie critic. The movie kept me interested in its duration,and it had a moral message that I appreciate. The script was good. No stupid lines or cliched ones. The cinematography was great. Did you see that lion scene?Get a load of the beginning war scene. Scene after scene got more interesting. Now the scene stealer for the moment or the few precious moments it ran is Djimon Hounsou's character. Maximus' friend. All I have to say is he was a gorgeous sight to view especially when the slave owner slaps his ass. I wish I was that guy. Damn what a beautiful specimen of a man.","

Maximus is a powerful character and his foil, Commodus, is despicable.

"MLDinTN","29 May 2002","Gladiator is terrific.  It is definitely one of my top 5 films of all time. I'm sure everyone knows the plot by now. Russell Crowe is one bad a**  MF that kicks major b*tt.  Not to mention he looks so hot as he is decapitating and slashing the competition.  But what makes this movie great is the story line is heart felt and you feel for Maximus after his family is murdered. It is the ultimate tale of revenge.
Russell Crowe is a great actor. I never heard of him before Gladiator but since seeing this I have watched a bunch of other films he is in. He's pretty good in them all. He should have won the oscar for The Insider and for A Beautiful Mind rather than Gladiator though, but just because those two movies were more ""oscar-like"".
FINAL VERDICT:  A definite must see. I have this one on tape to watch it over and over again.","

"GnrlGrnt","4 August 2000","How has Ridley Scott pulled the veil over everyone's eyes?  The camera-work in the first battle scene is disorienting and intentionally blurry to avoid showing anything in detail.  The dialogue, from start to finish, is unrealistic- both on a human level and a Roman level.  If you want to incorporate historical figures into a fictionalized account, treat them as historical figures, not perversions of historical figures with the same names.  Marcus Aurelius was not a 2000 year-too-early Thomas Jefferson. Whatever Hellenistic notions of democracy the Greeks held to, the Romans repudiated until the disintegration of their empire.  I laughed awkwardly (to mask my offense and disbelief) when Aurelius lets his daughter know what an impressive ""Caesar she would have made had she been born a man.""  What utter nonsense!  Furthermore, the character of Commodus is not so much miscast as it is botched in the person of Joaquin Phoenix.  Russell Crowe acquits himself nicely in his performance as Maximus, but is his story of revenge really that sympathetic?    The computer generated Rome is impressive, but not even on a par with the Rome of Julie Taymor's recent ""Titus.""  And what is this odd, recurring cornball shot of Maximus parallel to the ground as the grass moves under him?  The production value of Gladiator is high (at times), but someone should've hired a proofreader and BS detector.","

"danielll_rs","26 May 2000","Rating: ***1/2 out of ****WARNING: SOME THINGS HERE CAN BE CONSIDERED SPOILERSI like art-house films. I really do. OK, some of them are really dull and boring, but can you complain of Almodovar's and Buñuel's pictures, or the Kielowski trilogy of colors? I can't. I also like very much films that stay in the middle- are not simply artistic or simply entertaining: ""Magnolia"" (last year's best, by the way), ""American Beauty"", ""2001"". But for every ""That Obscure Object of Desire"" there's a ""Gladiator"". Not that ""Gladiator"" is empty (it talks about honor, courage, revenge), but its aim is to entertain audiences. So what? Let's have fun with it!As every $100+ million budget movie, ""Gladiator"" is visually stunning and perfectly done and executed. The visuals are so great, vibrating and realistic that we feel we are in the ancient Rome of emperors and gladiators. After so many boring and dull films (""1492""- a joy to our eyes but empty as a hollow piece of wood- and ""G.I. Jane""- that I, personally, felt ashamed to watch), Ridley Scott comes back with all his strength. It may be a little early, but he deserves a best director nomination at next year's Oscar. The way he recreates battle scenes and fight sequences in the Coliseum is amazing, almost unbelievable. My biggest disappointment with Luc Besson's ""The Messenger"" was the way he directed the battle scenes. It was the same thing of seeing a tomato being cut in slices, with Milla Jovovich yelling in the background. In ""Gladiator"" it's just the opposite. There's a battle scene in Germania. Only one, but it's so real, bitter, the best since ""Saving Private Ryan"". Thumbs up for you, Mr. Scott! Resurrect the old Rome is not for everyone, nor resurrect the epic genre, which was dead since... I don't know, for a long time. Believe it or not, ""Gladiator"" can be put on the same level of ""Spartacus"" or ""Ben-Hur"". May the epic genre stay with us and go on like this!One of the greatest merits of ""Gladiator"" (and also where its flaws are) is its screenplay. The film has 2 hours and a half, but I didn't feel it that long. I'm not against long picture (see ""Magnolia""), but entertaining films can't be boring. Well, there are slow moments in the film here and there- and that's the only visible flaw I can see. But, taking this, the screenplay is a joy. The characters have a good development, their lines are well written and the situations are emotional and intriguing. The cast just helps to keep our interest. Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen, who I think would be real problems for me, give solid performances. He is Commodus, son of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), who kills the own father to get the throne. Summarizing, the villain. Phoenix is surprising and sometimes haunting. Nielsen is pretty and strong as Lucilla, Commodus' sister and object of his incestuous desire. But Russell Crowe is the big star here. He is Maximus, a general of Marcus Aurelius' troop. The emperor is old and weak, and promises him the throne. Knowing this, Commodus kills his father and orders his soldiers to kill Maximus and his family. He escapes, but his wife and son die. He becomes a slave, but starts to show his talent of fighting. He is sent to Rome as a gladiator, looking for revenge against Commodus. Everything will be solved in the final scenes, which reminded me ""Hamlet"" for some reason- and will make some people cry. But let's talk about Crowe. After terrific performances in ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""The Insider"", he can receive his second Oscar nod with justice. He builds Maximus as a brave, strong, but also heartfelt man. Thumbs up for him too!Talking about 'thumbs-up', everything in ""Gladiator"" deserves this. It's not an unforgettable masterpiece, but I won't be angry if it becomes a classic. It delivers solid entertainment and has a strong dramatic side. What else do we need?","

"saadanathan","19 June 2020","""Gladiator"" is a spectacular film by Ridley Scott, a story of a man who lost his family and seeks revenge, eager to fight the emperor of Rome who turned him into a slave. Thus making him a gladiator. This original and breathtaking story is a masterpiece for many reasons: it's script, Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix give the performance of their lives. The score composed by Hans Zimmer and the action sequences in the arena. This is one of the best films happening in the times of the Roman empire and as said before, it is a masterpiece. The most memorable scene is of course when Maximus reveals himself towards Commodus and says he will have his revenge. Hands down the best scene and my favorite one.","

"C22Man","30 June 2016","Gladiator should be the type of film that I enjoy. Ridley Scott taking on something much grander than anything he had previously. A cast of fine actors led by Russell Crowe. A return to the sword-and- sandal epics of years gone by. It's a film of fine visual finesse, engaging action sequences and large themes. So why is it that Gladiator left me feeling so cold? Well it falls flat in its two most important areas, story and characters.It follows the gruff general Maximus who is named protector of Rome by Marcus Aurelius, that is until Aurelius is murdered by his own son Commodus who has Maximus exiled and his family killed. From here you can see exactly where the film is going. Maximus finds himself as a slave and is sold to a gladiator trainer named Proximo (played by the always great Oliver Reed) who wants to take him to Rome and help him fight his way to the top. This story is about as basic and clichéd as humanly possible. The hero is betrayed and fights his way back in order to get his revenge. That is effectively the main premise of the film. For such simplicity to work the film has to either add twists to the story or be incredible detailed, yet it does neither.The story also contains a weirdly handled sub-plot about Commodus trying to crush the senate who are constantly attempting to make him tackle real issues instead of hosting games. This could have been a decent side story but it's never fleshed out enough to leave an impact. Involved in basically every story thread is Commodus' sister Lucilla, who he also happens to want a child with (yes, he's that kind of kooky), and she becomes a plot device to link all of these pieces together. Joaquin Phoenix hams it up big time as Commodus and to be fair he is clearly meant to be a pantomime villain and Phoenix is probably the only person having fun in the entire film. Connie Nielsen deserves credit too for holding her own despite her incredibly underwritten character.Of course when Maximus and his gladiators get to Rome, they smash through all that stand in their way leading to the crowd turning over to Maximus' side and an inevitable confrontation with Commodus. How Russell Crowe won an Oscar for his performance is a mystery. Crowe himself is fine, but the role is as basic tough guy as it comes and anyone with a bit of muscle could have played the role as it is. Maximus is simply a poor leading character. He's just dour and dull as a rock for the entirety of the film, even before his family are killed off. What's is also notable is that the character doesn't grow. He's a bland, unsympathetic slab from the get-go who just becomes slight more revenge-fuelled as things progress. How can we empathise with this type of main character?Clearing those obstacles, I have little problems with the film on a technical level. It's Ridley Scott so you know the film with be very detailed and beautiful on a visual level and that is exactly what we get. Rome looks magnificent. Vast, majestic and full of people, whilst even the CGI is impressive and manages to blend in seamlessly. The film has an almost dirty brown, hazy look to it that actually works to its advantage. It fits the sullen mood that many of the gladiator's find themselves in. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard provide a score that feels like it's been ripped off by every action movie since it, especially the pieces where Gerrard appears to be singing in a made up language.The action scenes are a highlight. There is a grittiness to them that works for this time period. They not that well-choreographed and I thing that ways purposefully done, in order the show how many of the gladiators were fighting by using sheer aggression and desperation. Every stabbing or wounding looks and sounds painful and not in an overblown or unnatural way. The Coliseum looks fabulous and the films gets across the intimidating atmosphere of having to fight in there. I do have problems with how easily Maximus rises to the top, seeing as he's able to lead the gladiators through tough battles and defeat the only undefeated gladiators with relative ease. Then the climax eventually boils down to Maximus v Commodus and its entirely predictable and just a boring way to end.What is notable is that Gladiator didn't affect me on an emotional level at all. Even comparable epics like 'Braveheart', which shares similar issues, moved me. Gladiator left me numb. I didn't care about Maximus' plight because I was just given a shell of a character to try and get behind. I wasn't engaged in the story because it was simply a downbeat repeat of a storyline that has been done to death. I didn't even care on a basic level to see the villain get his comeuppance. All the talks of political treachery, what it means to be a gladiator and of meeting again in the afterlife just seemed like pieces to fill the film out. I can't deny that the film is a technical marvel or say that it bored me, but I can state that is built upon a story and set of characters that are wholly uninteresting.","

Movie audiences have long awaited a film which mixes history and action in such a way that it becomes memorable. Ridley Scott has become a true artist in his conception of action films. To date, few films have become so notable as this rendition of the last years of the Emperorer Marcus Aurelius( Richard Harris) on the Rhine. In this story we have a veteran Roman General (Russell Crowe) Maximus Meridius who having won yet another victory over the Germanic tribes, wishes nothing more than to go home and tend his crops. he asks his emperor for permission to go home, but before the wish is granted, he dies and his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) becomes the new ruler. Fearing the popular general is a threat to him, he orders him killed. Oliver Reed (In his last film) plays Proximo, an owner of slaves and gladiators saves him and offers him a chance for revenge. Derek Jacobi plays Gracchus who lends a splendid dignity to the film. Spencer Treat Clark is Lucius who finds the Spanish Gladiator admirable, courageous and interesting. Throughout the movies, one cannot but enjoy the settings, the costumes and the various sub-topics which make for drama at it's best. Highly recommended, this film is sure to become a Classic. ****","

I like watching watching these types of movies that are based about the past and show you how people used to live.

Maximus was so Turkic that he was wearing lamb fur(lamb was introduced by Huns to Europe) instead of bright armors of Romans,Like Tarkan he rides along his wolf, his family has been murdered by his foes ... you can claim that these may be inspirations of Ridley Scott from Tarkan but there are some scenes taken directly from Tarkan movies...1- Maximus fights a big German guy - Tarkan's fight against Giant Orso both are under snow.. 2- After the fight in arena, emperor orders death- neither Tarkan nor Maximus kill the victims. 3-The scene of birds over Rome 4-The appear order and camera movements in the arena at least the final is different, Maximus dies though Tarkan is immortal","

"mjw2305","21 January 2005","Maximus (Russell Crowe) is the commander of Rome's armies and preferred choice as the new Emperor of Rome, this is before Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix) murders his father Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) steals the throne for himself and has Maximus's family killed leaving him for dead.Set on avenging the loss of his family and his much loved and respected Emporer, Maximus fights his way to the Colosseum in hope of confronting his sworn enemy Commodus. An epic tale of power and corruption ensues and its very satisfying to witness, the fight scenes are fantastic and contain enough gore to bring realism without going overboard.Truly wonderful performances from Crowe Pheonix and Oliver Reed, bring this Ridley Scott masterpiece to life.Epic story, powerful drama, top movie 10/10","

"jimberg","13 June 2001","Firstly, Romans never referred to the Colloseum as the ""Colloseum"".  It was called the Flavian Amphitheatre.Commodus was an actual emperor who ruled from A.D. 180 to 192.  He did indeed fight in the Colloseum against gladiators, and was quite good at it because he never lost (Maybe he cheated like in the movie).His sister, Lucilla, did conspire with his wife Crispina to have him killed. They were caught and banished to an island and later killed.His mistress Marcia tried to drug him to death but failed, so they had some athlete strangle him to death.  He died on New Year's Eve A.D. 192.He was a nut case, and was quite murderous, but that's about the only things real about the movie.Other than the historical problems, the story was great.  I liked Maximus and really hated Commodus.  It was your basic struggle between good and evil.","

"Christopher_Reid","27 June 2008","I think without a doubt that Gladiator's strengths are its simple but powerful story and its engaging performances. Other than that, however, I think the overall style of the film and the film-making itself are already quite badly dated and forgettable. It doesn't feel like the personal vision of a talented filmmaker (Ridley Scott in this case) but more like an anonymous miniseries with great actors and a very big budget. So, it's good but it should have been great and I find it frustrating because I think it's overrated and I don't know why so many people either can't see or just don't mind what appear to me to be obvious flaws.The action scenes are no longer very special. Braveheart had passionate battle scenes with very precise and skillful choreography. It's not that these ones aren't skillful, but they aren't very original and there's nothing particularly personal about them either. And of course, the special effects are well past their ""best before"" date so that aspect no longer helps a whole lot.Is Hans Zimmer a hack? He blatantly rips off Holst's ""Mars: The Bringer of War"" (and does it badly), not to mention tinges of Vangelis, but maybe Scott is in part to blame for this. His orchestral texture is typical of his scores, there's the obligatory march (that sounds a lot like Pirates of the Caribbean, which he had a hand in, not to mention the Michael Bay movies he's done) and worst of all he employs the subtlety of a sledge hammer when it comes to setting the mood in rousing or emotional scenes. One major exception to this in my opinion was Richard Harris' last scene which I found surprisingly good, as if the director gave him some freedom and he actually liked the scene. Otherwise, Zimmer's music fits the movie, or at least its obvious surface layer, perfectly. No risks. No depth. Plenty of formula.Russel Crowe's performance transcends the dated film-making. It's honest and gritty. Oliver Reed also stood out for me (especially his eyes) while the rest are more than engaging. Coupled with the effective story, the performances make the movie worth seeing (IMHO).So, weakness = formulaic film-making. Strength = story + acting. I reckon if you replaced Hans Zimmer's score with any thematically similar music and re-filmed all the non-dialogue scenes using any competent but disinterested cinematographer, Gladiator would be just as popular as it currently is.","

Original scores and songs by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard gives you out of this world experience. Music has been used in places of dialogues, that many scenes in this movie are just told by music only without a dialogue.You can watch this movie again and again, you will still be mesmerized by this movie each time.

"jaybizman","11 November 2020","Russell Crowe rightly earned an Oscar for his performance in this movie.
Joaquin Phoenix played the part of a jealous, cowardly Emperor perfectly.There are thousands of 'Reviews' on IMDB about Gladiator, so I'd like to
add a personal anecdote or two; in the first ten minutes or so there is a final battle between the might of the Roman Army and the ""Huns"" (German Tribes.)
This was the Battle of Teutenberg Forest and it was shot in a farmers field, called Bourne Woods - about two miles from where I used to live.Seems that when the producers approached the UK's Forrestry Commission for
permission to (literally) burn down the forest on the land, they were given
permission as the forest was due to be uprooted anyway. So the Commission
was happy for the movie makers to do the work for them. Amazing.Oliver Reed (RIP) was someone who used to frequent a local pub, and he would
tell tall tales to keep everyone ""entertained"" - his drinking was legendary.This movie, IMO, paved the way for others to follow: ""sword and sandals"", such
as Centurion, The Eagle, etc. and will be difficult if not impossible to beat.Another Scott helmed movie is The Kingdom of Heaven with Orlando Bloom and Eva Green. If you loved Gladiator, check this one out also.Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" - entertainment par excellence. 10/10. Easily.","

Extravagant full-fledged sword and sandal epic from filmmaking genius Ridley Scott takes on the scopic tale of a vengeance seeking Spanish general named Maximus (Crowe in a star-making turn) whose disposition from glorified soldier to slave to eponymous athlete in ancient Rome seeks to avenge the slaughter of his beloved family, his good name and ultimately self-redemption for the betrayal and murder of his mentor Marcus Auerelius (a haggard looking Harris) by his petulantly incestuous son Commoudus (hissably evil Phoenix) and dissuade his sister Lucilla (the divine Nielsen) from emotional imprisonment. Lavish set designs, bold visual effects (check out the Colosseum!), dark and stark cinematography by John Mathieson and Pietro Scalia's razor sharp editing particularly in the arena's carnage dripping bouts with effectively cringing moments of unbridled violence (including one bitchin' chariot fight) that honors its predecessors 'Ben-Hur' and 'Spartacus' well. Sadly Reed's swan song but he gives a noteworthy performance as former gladiator turned slave owner who teaches Mad Maximus the finer skills in kicking ass.","

"bob the moo","26 October 2003","Maximus is the favoured commander of Emperor Aurelius' armies in Germania. He is favoured to the point that the Emperor, sensing his death is near, commands him to succeed him and return Rome to a republic.  Caesar's son discovers this, kills his father and orders Maximus dead.  However he survives and, finding his wife and son murdered, is captured by slave merchants and sold to gladiator trainer Proximo.  As his skills increase his strength he eventually comes to the games at Rome, where he finds himself anonymous and within striking distance of the revenge he seeks.If you strip away all the period settings and political battling in the background, this film is essentially a revenge film and a good one at that. It's best to ignore the liberties it takes with both logic and history and enjoy it for what it is.  At times it does threaten to take itself too seriously, but it's worthy sheen is just about supported by the emotive story and strong characters.  The film hits a good mix of political goings-on and action, with the action being the main body of the film.  It is delivered in bloody spades and the action scenes are a lot more dramatic than I expected.Although the characters fit into traditional revenge movie moulds (wronged man, evil man in position of power etc) they still manage to be strong characters in their own right.  Maximus is a strong hero and it is hard not to feel for him and thus get involved in the film.  True, the script is very generous in it's painting of him but this is a minor issue.  Crowe takes the lead really well and, while I don't personally care for him, he really fitted the role here.  Phoenix plays it well despite the fat he could easily have given into mugging the evil role.  Harris is good in his small role, although Jacobi just shows up once or twice.  Reed has a good part for his swansong but this is really Crowe's film and he commands it as his character does his army.The close of the film always gets me as it treats the characters and audience with respect (although it is not as daring as some would suggest. Overall this is a great film to watch as long as you don't take it too seriously or go looking for flaws.  The music and direction gives it a great feel  the music in particular used to support the required emotions created by the action.  Three hours go by very quickly and enjoyably.","

"michaelsibley416","6 September 2004","""Gladiator"" is one of the best films of the year. I hesitated to see this film for a long time for many reasons; however, when I saw it the other night I was thrilled. Also, ""Gladiator"" is laced with great scenery including the Roman coliseum and enriched with the history of Roman culture. Watching this movie was an experience I will never forget because it is like watching history come alive. The film is rich in history, the writers made it fun to watch because we learned about the Roman coliseum, gladiators and life in Rome.""Gladiator"" is an energetic, action packed, drama filled thrill ride which will excite everyone. Two other movies came to mind when I was watching this film; ""The Patriot"" and ""Braveheart"" were very similar to ""Gladiator"" because they all contain unique action sequences, will become classics and all star actors in Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe, who have become major players in Hollywood. ""Gladiator"" may not be the best movie, but it will win over the hearts of viewers when they rent it at their local video stores. I can't wait to let everyone know ""Gladiator"" has become one of my favorite films. I hope everyone will enjoy it as I did. ""Gladiator"" is rich in history and is a masterpiece with all the trimmings.","

"MovieAddict2016","20 October 2003","I originally saw ""Gladiator"" (2000) in the year of its release, and after seeing the movie again last night, my position on the film has not changed. I did not like it three years ago, and I still do not like it. Back then I was not reviewing on a professional basis--in fact, I had just started submitting comment/recommendation reviews on the Internet Movie Database. I gave ""Gladiator"" a bad comment and moved on. Now I can criticize it a bit deeper.""Gladiator"" stars Russell Crowe as Maximus, a Roman soldier who conquers in practically any and every battle. Caesar (Richard Harris) likes Maximus, and so he decides to give the throne to him after he dies and not to his immoral and irresponsible son (Joaquin Phoenix, who played Merrill in ""Signs,"" a much better movie).However, when Caesar's plans are revealed to his son, he murders his father and takes his place as Caesar, commanding Maximus to be taken out into the woods to be murdered. However, Maximus, being the great soldier that he is, escapes and flees back home to his wife and child--only to find them burned alive and hanging dead outside the house.Maximus eventually comes into custody and is thrown in a gladiatorial arena, where he becomes the main star, killing and conquering in every battle. Soon he is like a modern day baseball player--fans line up outside the Colosseum just to see him before the battles begin.Soon the new Caesar finds out who the great gladiator really is, and so turmoil begins. The new Caesar's sister (Connie Nielsen) once loved Maximus, so that is thrown in for good measure, too. While we're at it, let's throw in some futuristic battleships, robots and space aliens that Maximus can fight in the sequel, when he comes back from the dead. (And I'm not kidding about the following--a prequel is planned.)The movie is slow, and when it picks up speed it goes nowhere. It seems like a rip-off of ""Braveheart"" from beginning to end--a soldier's family is murdered and he takes revenge on the man/nation who killed them by fighting. Granted, he has no choice but to fight in ""Gladiator,"" but still...The movie was directed by Ridley Scott, the Englishman who directed ""Alien,"" ""Blade Runner"" and, among more recent films, ""Matchstick Men."" He's a talented director with an eye for atmosphere, but his films don't always work because sometimes his atmosphere gets the better of him--like in ""Gladiator."" The surroundings are dull, bleak and heartless. ""Braveheart"" had some ounce of beautiful settings, and Mel Gibson used long, wide lens shots of Scotland. Here we just get what we are presented with. And when the camera does pull back to give us the full picture, it's usually packed with very bad CGI effects of Colosseums and such.And Russell Crowe. How did he ever win (and I do mean it when I say ""win"") an Oscar for this mess? He delivers every line with the same monotone deadness in his voice as thirty minutes earlier in the film. He is and remains one of my least favorite actors, both on and off the screen. And if he wants to beat me up for saying mean things about him (as he usually does to people), he can just come over to my house and try. The greasy-haired baboon.The dialogue in the movie. Oh my! Things are said that you expect to read in a letter from a six-year-old to his/her parents. (I was just waiting to hear, ""My family is dead. I am sad."")To be honest, there were a few good moments in ""Gladiator."" It has some impressive fight scenes, including one with two men fighting while tigers leap out of cages built underneath the sand of the arena floor and lunge for the battling duo. I must say that I came close to recommending the movie at certain times. But then it would slow down its pace again and turn into some sort of large-budget cornball. I understand that many people love this movie. Give me ""Braveheart"" any day.2.5/5 stars.John Ulmer","

"Meltdown53098533","20 November 2002","Gladiater is without a doubt the best movie of the new millennium. There are almost no flaws with the filming or acting (aside from the fact the Russell Crowe is in real life a loser). Crowe deserved his accademy award for acting.                   PLOT. A general in ancient Rome is forced to flee the land after not bowing before the new Emperor ( who killed his own father to be Emporer). And so Maximus ( the general) becomes a slave and must battle through Gladiator combat, hoping to avenge the death of the original emperor.           The film is packed with pulsating and gruesome violence and yet incredible acting abillity. 9.5 out of 10.

"pzanardo","23 January 2002","Let's forget ""Gladiator"" won the Oscar for the best film: even worse things may happen. As a matter of fact, the movie contains uncountable mistakes and flaws on Roman history and ancient life in general. Some examples follow.
The gladiators were almost NEVER killed in the arena. That's clear: they were too important for the show business, and it costed too much money to train a gladiator to have him murdered. Their fights followed strict rules, nothing to do with the absurd slaughters shown in the movie.
A Roman Citizen by no means could be made slave, as it happens to Maximus in the movie. If sentenced by the Emperor, he could be killed by anybody, but neither made slave nor tortured. That's the reason why Saint Paul was be-headed and not crucified. And the fact that Maximus uses his long sword (Romans had no long swords) with two hands in a Samurai-like style is just too ridiculous to deserve comments.The Roman army in battle followed a scientific strategy, with tight lines of troops protected by their shields, an established sequence of attacks and retreats, and so on. The battle at the beginning of the movie is an over-confused, poorly photographed brawl. The camp of the Roman Legion was a perfect square, with a strong palisade, and the tents of all ranks were neatly divided inside it. Nothing to do with the messy camping in the forest shown in the film.""Gladiator"" won an Oscar for the best costumes, too. Well, I think that Oakland Raiders fans wear nicer and more realistic costumes. In particular, the armours and weapons in the movie are unbelievably mistaken: most of them first appeared some 800 years later than the epoch of the story.But let's forget about Roman History, and say that ""Gladiator"" is either fantasy, or science-fiction, or something like that. Nonetheless, it remains a very ugly movie. The story is boring and utterly predictable. For instance, the whole episode of Maximus' attempted escape can be fore-seen almost second by second. Maximus returns home and finds his house wasted and his family destroyed... a strikingly original idea... perhaps already seen in dozens of western movies! By the way, Maximus goes from Germany to southern Spain (say 1500 miles?), pursued, with no food. How long did this pleasant journey last? Two months? And what about the gangrenous wound, later healed by a fellow gladiator? Come on! And the repeated wanna-be-touching oneiric scene with the hand and the wheat is clumsy and far-fetched.The action scenes are confused and badly filmed. The violence is so excessive to become ridiculous. The script is awful. The cinematography is generally very poor. Large use of close-ups like in a TV-movie, extremely brief choral scenes. Why? Perhaps in order that the viewer doesn't notice the computer tricks? The fight which closes the movie is by far less spectacular than all other arena scenes: I think this is an enormous mistake for an action flick. Something to save in ""Gladiator""? The bucks it has made.","

Robbed of an Oscar there. Also robbed of an Oscar was Scott. This is his masterpiece film. Terrific performances by the rest of the supporting cast. Cinematography and special effects are also flawless. And the writing.

Emperor Marcus Aurelius is an aging ruler who prefers Maximus than his own conniving son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). After Commodus kills his own father, Maximus refuses to acknowledge the new emperor and his family is slaughtered. He falls into slavery and the gladiator arenas.The scale is a grand. The use of CG is top notch. It really expanded the visual experience to the required spectacle. Russell Crowe takes on the big Hollywood leading man role with ease. Joaquin Phoenix is well conceived as the evil foil to Crowe. The movie has the big battles, and the fun gladiator fights. It is grand in the best traditions of Hollywood.","

"GMJames","7 March 2001","While watching ""Gladiator"", I was reminded of a number of films with either a similar setting (""Ben Hur"", ""El Cid"") or a similar storyline (avenge your family's murder like ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", or gather a large group of people to fight against a oppressive leadership like ""Braveheart"").Despite the film's budget and some of director Ridley Scott's impressive visuals, ""Gladiator"" left me cold. The movie didn't blow me away. Throughout the movie, I was reminded of films that did a better job. ""Gladiator"" felt very drab and, in some stretches, dull.I've been impressed with Russell Crowe's work in a number of movies including ""Romper Stomper"", ""L.A. Confidential"" and especially, ""The Insider"". I was not impressed with his work in this movie. I thought that he captured the physical aspects but not the emotional. I was surprised how much I didn't care about his character.I thought Joaquin Phoenix did a better job as Commodus. His callous, cold-blooded actions were right on target. I did find it interesting that Derek Jacobi, who played Gracchus, played a similar character in the title role of ""I, Claudius"" several decades ago.Considering all the battles that occurred in the film, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Oliver Reed gave his most understated performance in the final movie of his career.As always, with any Ridley Scott film, the visuals will always be impressive. But unless the script he directs from is really good (e.g., ""Thelma and Louise""), the end product will always be a good-looking but underwhelming movie.","

"hitchcockthelegend","6 August 2014","Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.I didn't know man could build such things.Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10","

There's so much to recommend this - Lisa Gerrard & Hans Zimmer's iconic score, the canny casting of Joaquin Phoenix as a foil for Crowe; the realisation that I quote this film in everyday conversation far more than I thought I did. If it should have won the Oscars is a moot point - this is another of Ridley Scott's superb worldbuilding - one of his primary film-making skills, giving us a Rome that feels recognisable yet still a break from the cliché's that had seeped in to popular culture before this. That the film's status was boosted by the DVD boom as it made its way to home release is undeniable, but this remains a film that thrills, absorbs and grips.","

The acting first rate, surely the aim of any film is to move you, this does just that and then some.The best of Russell Crow are far as I'm concerned, he really does command the screen throughout, Joaquin Phoenix is just as good, it makes me so sad that this was the last film of the late great Oliver Reed, and of course he's awesome.I must also comment on the incredible soundtrack, the sublime music of Has Zimmer coupled with the ancient, enchanting voice of Lisa Gerrard, the music is the same glorious standard as the film, Now we are free still gives me chills, and takes me back to the film.One of my top ten films of all time, a masterpiece, 10/10.","

"Iam-Not-In-Danger-Iam-The-Danger","24 February 2020","Gladiator is a historical epic from director Ridley Scott. After being betrayed by the new Caesar, Roman general Maximus is sold into slavery as a gladiator where he rises to fame as a people's champion and finds an opportunity to exact his revenge. Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Connie Nielsen lead the cast and deliver strong performances. Additionally, the gladiator fights are especially dynamic and exciting, featuring several different styles of combat. The costumes and sets are also remarkably well-done, and create a vivid depiction of ancient Rome. And, Hans Zimmer's score does an excellent job at capturing the tone of the film. Thrilling and action-packed, Gladiator delivers a compelling tale. ""Are you not entertained?!""","

"TheLittleSongbird","15 May 2009","Ridley Scott rarely disappoints with his films. All of them, including the unjustly-maligned Legend, are visually stunning and just show the director's artistic genius. Gladiator should be up there as one of the best films he's done, if not the best. Almost everything on screen is very graphic, making some scenes upsetting to watch, but the visuals are just outstanding. The music score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the drama that is already there in the script. which is well written and rather Shakespearean. The performances were brilliant, especially Joaquin Pheonix and Oliver Reed. Russell Crowe is wholly convincing in the title role, and Richard Harris and Connie Nielson are also excellent. The costumes are brilliant, as well as the sets. In conclusion, Gladiator is a near masterpiece, only marred by some upsetting scenes. 9/10 Bethany Cox.","

"jaredpahl","9 July 2017","Gladiator, 2000's Best Picture winner, was undoubtedly one of the biggest successes of the decade. It made tons of box-office cash, nearly swept the Oscars, and revitalized the sword-and-sandals genre for years to come. Does the movie warrant the massive success it received? For the most part, yes. Ridley Scott's Roman blockbuster doesn't have quite the overwhelming emotion of another Oscar-winning epic, Braveheart, but as a brawny action spectacle, Gladiator soars. With a strong story, a profound sense of character, and action and special effects that are suitably exciting, Gladiator is a special kind of sword-and-sandals picture; One with a true dramatic core.Like the great epics of Hollywood's past, Gladiator is simple in its story. Russell Crowe stars as the Roman General, Maximus, whose life is thrown into chaos after the jealous Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) arranges for his execution. Maximus is sold into slavery where he meets Proximo, a former gladiator played by Oliver Reed who shepherds him through life as a gladiator as Commodus scrambles to stop Maximus' influence among the people. The story of Gladiator is a rock-solid tale of revenge, bolstered by well written characters, some sly political subtext, and a couple of stellar performances from Crowe and Phoenix. The two principle characters, Maximus and Commodus, are what separates Gladiator from the slew of sword-and-sandals epics that came after it. They are simply but elegantly written as characters; Maximus, a man singularly driven by a need to return to his family, Commodus, a confused young man singularly driven by a need to be loved. However, it is the performances from Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix that really elevate this material. Phoenix gives a brilliant portrait of an emotionally frustrated young man. He is completely unpredictable, but he never becomes campy. He is a real person with real problems, and there is an underlying sadness to his character that makes him so much more interesting than your typical stock villain. As for Crowe, his performance is all about physical presence. Apart from a few big emotional scenes, Crowe's performance is one of quiet masculine stoicism. He adds a remarkable gravitas to this character that all but makes the movie. You feel for him, you relate to him, you root for him, and you become inspired by him. It is a perfect heroic performance. The character stuff in Gladiator really works. Coming from a genre that made do with archetypal characters doing obligatory British accents for years, it is nothing short of a revelation that Gladiator is such a fulfilling dramatic experience. Here are characters you actually care about and not simply placeholders to string up the plot in between action scenes.When it comes to general filmmaking, Gladiator is rarely pedestrian and often astounding. Apart from some strange quirks in the filmmaking like the seemingly digitized zooms or the moments when the frame rate seems to cause a weird flicker effect, Gladiator is a deep, rich, and meticulously detailed visual experience. Hollywood production values don't get much higher than this. The technical departments are tops in terms of production design and costuming. The movie looks expensive, but there is something else in Gladiator's visual style that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. The look of the film, with its mix of traditional, large- scale sets and CG enhancements, is almost dreamlike. The environments of Ridley Scott's version of ancient Rome, including a painstakingly crafted digital recreation of the famous Colosseum, seem untethered to any kind of physical reality. It's as if what Scott has created is an environment that reflects the feeling of Ancient Rome rather than the reality of it. Just as with the deep characters and eloquent script, there's a modern feeling to Ridley Scott's filmmaking in Gladiator. The reliance on CGI is sometimes overdone, but in conjunction with the costumes, sets, and impressively grandiose score from Hans Zimmer, it adds to the intoxicating atmosphere of Ridley Scott's world.The main attraction of Gladiator is its scenes of gladiatorial combat, and on that front, Ridley Scott aptly gets the job done. There are a few moments when Scott falls back on to standard sword clashing and disorientating shaky cam, but for the most part, the action scenes are exciting, bloody, and imaginatively staged. The best action scenes are the opening Barbarian battle and a fantastic fight scene between Maximus, a veteran gladiator, and a Colosseum full of bloodthirsty tigers. In those scenes, Scott's emphasis on close-up, sweaty, brutal action is totally effective. I felt the cold of the forest mud, the heat of the flaming trees, the sharpness of the swords, and the dusty claustrophobia of the Arena. The action of Gladiator is visceral and bloody, and there is plenty of it. Those hungry for bloodsport will find more than enough manly derring-do to satiate their red-blooded desire.For all its dramatic depth, I can't say I came out of Gladiator heavily affected by feeling. This is still, at its core, a visceral experience, but the small character moments and the textured performances are miraculously riveting. I was intrigued by every second of Gladiator. The action scenes are thrilling, the dramatic scenes are mesmerizing, and the $103 million budget is all up there on the screen in every frame. Ridley Scott's direction is superlative, especially in the third act, as the story, action, and emotions reach a fever pitch. The last few scenes, including the climactic final showdown and the closing 'Elysium' scene, exhibit a crescendo of the kind of daring artistry that permeates the film's best sections. Gladiator is a meaty Hollywood epic of the best kind. It's visually sumptuous and supremely thrilling, but there is a beating heart within this beast. Sure there are a couple of bumps along the way, but with Crowe as the sturdy hero and a simple story of returning home, Gladiator stays with you long after the credits roll.92/100","

"ccthemovieman-1","1 November 2006","An intense Roman epic, a la ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Spartacus,"" it was nice to see something like this made again. It had been since the 1960s that we had seen a 3-hour extravaganza like this.Like Ben-Hur, this is a story of a successful man who loses everything thanks to an evil man, and then has to fight his way back up to seek revenge on that man and to obtain his freedom back. It's a tried-and-true formula. This movie doesn't go to excess on the violence as some of the other more recent epic films did, such as ""Braveheart"" or ""The Patriot.""The acting is excellent, beginning with Russell Crowe, who has established himself as one of the best actors of today. Joaquin Phoenix also put himself ""on the map"" as an actor with his portrayal of the evil ""Commodus."" He's so annoying you want to slap that sucker, which means he's doing a good job acting. Kudos to the rest of the cast, too.Too bad they don't make more of these type of films, as they did in the 1950s and 1960s.","

"Leofwine_draca","22 July 2016","An epic, awe-inspiring movie which thankfully shows us that Hollywood hasn't forgotten how to make good movies anymore, this is a film which has it all, from intrigue to suspense to violence to subtle romance. Forget any of the other CGI-laden rubbish filling out the multiplexes, this is a film which simply has to be seen at the cinema - or alternatively on a very big television screen indeed. Due to the fact that this film was hyped up incredibly, it doesn't actually live up to the hype, but nothing could have done. GLADIATOR is pure, old-fashioned escapism, nothing less.For once, the acting is totally flawless. Russell Crowe comes out of nowhere to give us a powerful, sensitive action hero, able to emote without the use of dialogue, delivering his lines when needed with a gruff British accent. Crowe is a revelation here - I hated him in VIRTUOSITY, but his acting is excellent and finely judged, right up there with the brooding intensity of De Niro or Pacino. He is well supported by a varied cast, including Connie Nielsen who makes a very sultry and alluring love interest. Joaquin Phoenix makes his snivelling, whining emperor truly despicable, easily soaking up the entire audience's hatred. Oliver Reed is also very good in what was to be his final role, as the proud but friendly slave owner who becomes Maximus' friend. Richard Harris lends an air of nobility and authenticity in his brief role as the dying emperor Caesar, while noted British actors Derek Jacobi and David Hemmings appear as senators.Okay, so the plot of revenge is a fairly clichéd one and the plot here is reminiscent of a whole number of other films, as well as MACBETH, but it is given added power and resonance by the great acting. The music score is also absolutely excellent and really adds to this film's atmosphere. Physically, it is beautifully made and extremely realistic - you constantly feel that you're in Rome itself. Everything is epic and the whole film is chock-full of grandeur. It looks lovely, it sounds lovely, hell, it is lovely.Director Ridley Scott doesn't skimp on the gore front either, leaving in some gruesome shots of people being cut in half, being decapitated and blood spraying in the air and all over the place. The battle scenes are the highlight of the film and are filmed in a weird way - sometimes sped up, sometimes slowed down - which make them so realistic that you do feel like you're there. They're also very exciting, with Crowe taking on ferocious tigers, masked hulking warriors, and chariots too. The twists and turns in the plot are unexpected and there's a moving, poignant ending giving this film an extra element. Old-fashioned, well-crafted and truly splendid - any movie fan owes it to themselves to see this film.","

"uds3","30 May 2002","It saddens me that a man such as Ridley Scott can work for months on location bringing the most perceptive and detailed vision of ancient Rome to absolute reality, only to incur the inappropriate, juvenile and one dimensional comments such that I have read here - the following few ""reviews"" (and I use the term 'loosely') especially. Comments such as ""horrible movie,""  ""no interesting characters,"" ""bad acting"" and my personal favorite, ""crappy special effects,"" is a sad epitaph to the lack of awareness and utter stupidity of so many viewers.GLADIATOR is one of the finest movies ever made, I don't ""think"" it, I am telling you! Ridley Scott pulled off a jaw-dropping miracle reeling the finished product in at just on $60 million. It has the appearance, continuity and professional veneer of a $300 million production. It is in fact only an adaptation on Samuel Bronston's classic 1964 movie THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, itself the most literate and well-acted epic of the 50's and 60's...and again, the key figure of Marcus Aurelius is handled with such dignity, feeling and intelligence. In 1964 Sir Alec Guinness played Aurelius as a strong and clear-thinking man of moral strength and fortitude. In GLADIATOR, Richard Harris hands in what I consider his best role ever, portraying Aurelius as a political visionary, caring parent and incorruptible leader. Excellent though Russell Crowe is here, it is Ridley Scott makes the film what it is, together with the cinematography and enervating musical score. Russell has actually not that great a dialog overload! In the acting department, Phoenix blows him off the screen as the immoral, aggrieved and ultimately weak emperor in waiting. Oliver Reed as Proximo? Well, how he did not win best supporting actor posthumously I will never know. This is the greatest Oscar scandal in history as far as I am concerned. It was the role of his life and he took it in both hands and wrung his life out into the part....completely it would seem. He died as he would have wished, tanked and slipping off a bar stool in Malta towards the end of filming. But he gave us an unforgettable Proximo and I will long honor his name with the memory of what he did here.Crappy special effects huh?  Well, in the film I saw - I was looking at the COLOSSEUM, not a special effect. I was there with them. I have never seen any CGI effect come close to what these techos achieved. Can you believe there were no more than 48 people ever on set? The ""crowds"" were made up of the same 48 people wearing different clothes and ""matted"" together - you want to tell me it ""looked"" like that? The arena action certainly was a far cry from the ""Chariot Race"" in BEN HUR but there again, what isn't? It was still exciting stuff though, well for the vaguely cerebral set I hasten to add.A film like GLADIATOR comes along probably once every 40 years or so. Its a pity so many didn't notice it THIS time around. Still, you are probably outnumbered three to one.","

"shoktart","19 February 2001","Great Story!  Great Writing!  Great Acting!  Great Directing!  Great Score! This movie has it all.  I especially enjoyed the mood of the film.  Even though it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style.  The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations.  Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the ""general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor.""  Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus.  Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine.  It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla.  However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles.  Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers.  Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo, the trainer for the gladiators.  The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the ""thrill of the Coliseum"" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate.  The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene.  But the whole movie is a rush!  Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie.  Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing.  I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages.  Next to Braveheart, this movie is the greatest of all-time!","

It has a strong female character, positive and realistic minority rep (the Roman Empire extended into Africa and I think lots of people forget that), and a compelling revenge plot. Every line moves the plot forward and is memorable. The music is gorgeous. The acting is impeccable. The visuals are absolutely stunning - especially the rose petals raining down as the emperor is ascending on the platform. The visual of the emperor dead in the colosseum while the crowd lifts Maximus away. The whole concept of Elysium makes me cry every time. The ending couldn't have wrapped everything up better.","

"RayCharles81","9 December 2023","I love when you haven't seen a great movie in five years and then happen to stumble on it on the perfect night to revisit it, somewhat forgetting much of it, or at least the affecting impact it can have on you. That was me with Gladiator recently.Most has already been said, so I want to just zoom in on a couple or parts and features. Before I do, it's a great and rarely acknowledged fact that although most of the story is fictionalized, in reality, Commodus was really infatuated with the Gladiator games; he also did indeed compete and corruptly fabricated his win-loss record. Outside of the Coliseum arena, he had a statue of himself enshrined that listed his record at something like 60 wins and no losses. However, he could rig any match he wanted and most historical accounts dispute he fought on that many matches- he may have been in a dozen or so, but doubtfully was he in that many. Also, while it would be cool if, like in the film, another gladiator fought him like that in the ring, in reality, it was Commodus' trainer that was supposedly responsible for his demise. This is interesting because while many of the story components are inaccurate, one might assume that Commodus' character was completely made up also, but he truly was a big fan and even competitor in the games.The staging of the scenery and background construction of Rome is absolutely brilliant and breathtaking. It makes you really feel like you're there in many scenes. How many movies can transport you back to experience legendary Rome two thousand years ago?Even more so brilliant is how not much has changed. Sure, our athletes don't fight to the death and now get paid sufficiently, but the relation and comparison to modern day sports events is vividly shown. The same is true for the politics- yeah, it's all in there in there. While the political components are not a deep dive, the film touches on enough philosophies and strategic realities to go a little and just enough beyond the surface to paint the picture that little has changed. There's corruption, schmoozing, contempt, grandstanding, loyalties, and nepotism.Phoenix is so entertaining to watch playing the sick, twisted, power hungry, bloodlusting emporer, especially when he's enjoying the battle of Carthage. He is truly outstanding in this role, arguably missing out on an early career, deserved Oscar award. While many of his scenes are disturbing, he is always riveting.This is a movie you will lose yourself in.The Battle of Carthage is truly awesome. This was a very elaborate and complex sequence with lots of moving parts, showing that director Scott wasn't just phoning it in. When the chariot crashes through the gate, you really feel the tides turn, like this isn't what Commodus and his organizers expected. Cutting back and forth to Commodus' reactions was a great decision and likewise with all the senators' and Connie Nielson's. That was my favorite match.My second favorite match was Tigris. What a spectacle it was having the tigers pop out from underground, and Commodus' disappointment again having thought he rigged Maximus' demise was again a great revelation.Every scene is well acted, even the behind the action scenes with Commodus and his sulister, Gracchus, and Proximo and Maximus.It's truly a classic and awesome film experience. Ridley Scott must have had a ""no bull----"" rule while making the movie because it really doesn't waste a second and with sequences like Carthage battle going right into the Commodus-Maximus confrontation, and then how quickly the film goes from battle to battle, it just feels like a filmmaker who is not screwing around. I think this has to be appreciated much more, as we know so many movies today waste time and meander.My only complaint was that we didn't get to see the promised, would-be invasion of Rome with Maximus escaping and returning with his five thousand soldiers. That would have been epic beyond epic. Instead, we get a good showdown. But to its credit, I'll give it this: Maximus at least kept half of his promise, and the end result was much the same since Commodus could no longer rule and the sister and Gracchus honored Aurelias' final wish (no invasion necessary in that regard, still I would've liked the action and suspense more).Even though many try to criticize the scripts simplicity, I disagree and find the dialogue and monologues to be quality drama and somewhat Shakespearean at times. Even the weaker scenes that were probably added are just drowned out in the action and serve their purpose to keep the audience informed.And make no mistake here: this is a visual movie, and there is much more said and conveyed in the close ups of the facial expressions of the main characters, from evil glances, to vengeful scowls, to shaking jaws, tearful eyes, frightened faces, mad bloodlusting tongue stick outs, and hopeful daydream-like optimistic smiles.We all know what's going on here, witnessing humanity at its' corrupted, animalistic worst and heroic, godly, and noble best. The end result is a masterpiece of visual, visceral spectacle and drama about one man's fall and rise by honor and heroism and another's rise and fall by corruption and cowardice, in front of the backdrop of one of the seven great wonders of the world. It doesn't get much more epic than this these days!I hope my review is merciful and you are all entertained!","

"moondoggy88","6 March 2002","I borrowed this movie on DVD, but I wish I had seen it in the theater for it would have been a lot more fun and powerful there. Despite this, Gladiator is one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen. The plot goes so smooth together, as well as the acting and the terrific musical score. Director Ridley Scott puts all effort into making this film an epic, and he does just that. I'd have to say that anyone who likes Ridley Scott (I sure do) should see this. It is a lot like Ridley's other movies (Black Hawk Down was also amazing). If you can stand a little bit--well, ok a LOT of blood and gore, then you should see this. Russell Crowe shows an excellent performance like no other. I don't think there's one bad movie that Ridley Scott has made or that Russell Crowe has acted in. The fact that the brutal battles involving innocent slaves in this film actually happened in real life centuries ago makes it even more interesting and powerful. Emperor Commodus is a truely evil and life-like villian who shows a lot of his wits in attempts to get his revenge against Maximus.Ridley Scott went to many different locations to shoot this film to make it real, and he does. The film is set in Rome, and it looks just like it. You feel as if you are there in the crowd, hearing them cheer and cheer to see the death. To some of you, this may sound a little barbaric, and believe me the film is VERY barbaric and brutual, however it teaches a very strong lesson of what happens when an economy turns as violent as Rome was. Ridley Scott goes to many lengths to make this movie real, because even though the characters are fictitious, all of this really did happen. Innocent people had to go through brutual fighting while thousands of people cheered for either their death or the enemy's death. If you were an inexperienced fighter, chances are you would get killed. But the strange thing is that Rome LOVED this. People came from all over to see these fights and to see the blood that was shed, that is why you can't blame the characters in this film for being so forlorn and saddened the whole time. The film itself is very dark. The theme is dark and the ending is dark. From beginning to end there is excessive violence (for those action movie-goers, this is a movie for you). But if the violence is concerning you, don't let it. The special effects make the movie great, but it's the acting and storyline that make it spectacular. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED for anyone who wants a good time. Definitely makes you think. ***** out of *****.","

"Russell_","12 September 2005","""Gladiator"" definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple, but moving, story with beautiful scenery, filming, direction and score  it is truly a ""complete"" movie.I am mostly compelled with the beautiful script which in a way reminds me of poetry, though it is still everyday language. I love the acting portrayed by the late Oliver Reed and also Richard Harris. Russell Crowe, Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less ""popular"" artists who also deserve a big ""bravo"". Amongst them I have to mention ex-Mr Universe Ralph Moeller who is mostly used as the comic relief of the movie. In Gladiator we can also the beautiful and popular Maltese TV Star and actress Ruth Frendo, who although has a small part, she is totally brilliant and outstanding.Actually I got to IMDb while I was looking for her name on the internet, in fact on IMDb she has some very stunning photos. I was lucky to meet Ruth Frendo whilst she was filming in another Maltese production. Ruth Frendo is not only a gorgeous and talented actress but she is also amazingly intelligent and very down-to-earth. We will definitely be seeing more of her work in the future... The scenery used for ""Gladiator"" is brilliant  and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie; and I love the light contrasts thanks to the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal feel to the entire movie.""Gladiator"" deserves all the awards and great reviews it has received, and for those of you who still haven't gone and watched it  I can assure you that it will be well worth your time and money. So go on and rent it now!","

"paulyb","2 May 2000","The epic blockbuster returns with the 21st Century's answer to Cecil B DeMille, Ridley Scott and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge, GLADIATOR - ""the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor"".Once a great roman General, and as good as adopted son of Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Harris), Maximus (Crowe) is forced into exile by Commodus (Phoenix), heir to the throne, after the death of Marcus. Saved from death by slavers, he is purchased for use as a gladiator by Proximo (Reed) and ends up in the arena of all arena's, the Colloseum, where he proves unbeatable under his guise as ""The Spaniard"".And with a budget of over $100m, Scott certainly delivers the goods. GLADIATOR transcends the notion of 'blockbuster' that we have become accustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and instead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus and and Ben Hur. Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that contains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss, courage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc etc) - also on offer is a visual feast of cinematic painting after painting - a rich tapestry of images that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the plains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to great Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended highly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film. The opening  battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the screen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays incredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way, Scott has created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings (and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky depths of film history where they belong.The cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the task with a great emotional range and depth of character. His accent ocassionally bugged me (as did the mish mash of accents on offer - but that is I guess a legacy of 'internationally casted films'), but this aside, he was well and truly up to the task. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus, as is Nielson as Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus who ""should have been a son"" and finds herself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is 'right'. The old guard thesps of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong as supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job as the young heir to the throne.Add to this great cast excellent editing and post production work, and an intricate soundscape (including a magnificent Hans Zimmer score), and you have a film that, despite its length, was highly palatable and had me in there from beginning to end. A must see.","

"angelo-29","6 June 2000","Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world. Well, you should see for yourself!","

"drqshadow-reviews","21 July 2020","A number of giant, career-making performances (plus another impressive turn in the director's chair for Ridley Scott) fuel this rich, hard-hitting saga of betrayal, grief and revenge in imperial Rome. The dueling fates of Maximus (Russell Crowe) and Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) share the front and center, twin note-perfect parts that continuously clash over the spotlight, but dozens of supporting players also deserve recognition. Richard Harris as the guilt-ridden sage, Marcus Aurelius. Oliver Reed chewing scenery as a grizzled, cynical combatant-turned-slaver. Djimon Hounsou and Ralf Moeller, comrades in arms who convey an intimate, crucial sense of kinship. As an intensely emotion-driven story, Gladiator can't function without this level of acting power. In less capable hands, it might be laughed off the screen. With Crowe, Phoenix and company in command - and, again, Scott there to expertly piece it all together amid an appropriately epic score by Hans Zimmer - we're swept off our feet.It's an enveloping film; a thick flood of sights, sounds and moods. We marvel over the bustling Roman Colosseum, tense our muscles in the raging chaos of battle, find peace in the metaphor of golden wheat fields as an afterlife. Maximus's justified outrage becomes our own, Commodus (with his barely-contained mania) our bane, and once it's got those hooks in, the script doesn't give an inch. An exceptionally powerful production, damn near perfect in all respects.","

The battle scenes are intense and visually striking, and Scott's attention to detail in recreating historical settings adds to the film's authenticity.Russell Crowe delivers a powerhouse performance as Maximus, earning him an Academy Award for Best Actor. Crowe portrays the character's strength, determination, and inner turmoil with an authenticity that makes Maximus a truly compelling and memorable protagonist.Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus is equally brilliant.

"gregatory","3 May 2000","Most films require that the viewer identifies with the character to truly be engrossed with the film. If you can't feel something for the character, than the audience is lost.Luckily, in Ridley Scott's case, Russel Crowe is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors today, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders.Not to say that he is the only reason this works. The supporting cast, most notably Connie Neilsen, buoy the film to new perspectives.Jacquin Phoenix definitely captures the egotisitcal persona he should display, stealing every scene he's in. Phoenix will surely be put on the map with Gladiator.But the real shining star in this film are the incredible action sequences which jolt the viewer right in with the opening sequences, as Maximus' true worth to the Roman Empire is displayed. Scott's camera work within these completed sequences takes a modern twist that really works for the gruesome scenes.Crowe will now get the respect he deserves for this collosal performance. Gladiator makes the most of its 2 and a half hours, marking a triumphant comeback for the long forgotten epics of the classic days of film. ALL HAIL MAXIMUS!","

"bkoganbing","4 October 2020","35 years after Samuel Bronston and Anthony Mann gave us The Fall Of The Roman Empire, Ridley Scott told the same tale of the Emperor Commodus and
his problems succeeding his legendary father, Emperor/philosopher Marcus Aurelius. Neither film got the story right, both have him killing his father and
both have him with a hero/rival. In the Mann film it's Stephen Boyd in this film it is Russell Crowe. Both have a sister working against him Sophia Loren in the
Mann film and in the Ridley Scott film Connie Nielsen.Although I loved Christopher Plummer in The Fall Of The Roman Empire, truth be told Joaquin Phoenix is closer to the real Commodus. Commodus was only a teen when he became Emperor in 180 AD and reigned a lot longer than it seemed in Gladiator. In real life he was strangled by a wrestler who was part of a conspiracy. He did in fact love the Coliseum and did like to participate occasionally as is shown in both films.In this film when Joaquin Phoenix learns that Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius plans to name Russell Crowe one of his best fighting generals as his successor he kills Harris and Crowe's family. Crowe is sold off in bondage, but works his way back to Rome to take Phoenix down.Gladiator marks he farewell film of Oliver Reed who plays the head of the gladiator school who trains Crowe. Derek Jacobi plays a senator and as he did
in I Claudius dreams of reestablishing the republic.Gladiator won for Best Picture and Best Actor for Russell Crowe and also won for costume design, special effects, and best sound. Sharp film fans will see
bits of both Ben-Hur and Spartacus woven into the story.Gladiator is a well put together drama and Crowe and Phoenix have quite an acting duel. Maybe the real Commodus story will get a film one day. Until then Gladiator and The Fall Of The Roman Empire will do nicely.","

"sddavis63","24 March 2002","The beginning of ""Gladiator"" is powerful. We see the Roman Legion fighting against the Germanic tribes in what surely must be one of the most spectacular battle scenes ever filmed; one which truly does give the viewer a taste of what warfare in that era must have been like. The ending is powerful, as the quest for vengeance finally comes to a head, with General Maximus facing the Emperor Commodus in a gladiatorial contest in the Roman arena. In between - well - things could have been a little better.The acting in this movie, I thought, was first-rate. Russell Crowe as General Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix as Emperor Commodus and Connie Nielsen as Lucilla, sister of Commodus, all played their parts perfectly. The gladiatorial bouts were superbly choreographed. The set decoration was magnificent, and looked exactly as I would expect Imperial Rome to have looked. So, why do I say this could have been better?(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Basically, the whole thing was just a bit too clear-cut for me. Maximus was too obviously the good guy, Commodus too obviously the bad guy. With this being so clear, we know that the movie must be heading for the final confrontation between the two, and it makes watching the middle 90 minutes or so difficult. ""Get on with it,"" I found myself thinking from time to time. It didn't have to be quite so clear cut. The potential was there to give the viewer a real ethical choice to make. I mean, one can understand Commodus being angry when Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) - his father - takes away the throne that Commodus had believed all his life would be his, and hands control of Rome over to Maximus. Commodus could have been a sympathetic character. He didn't have to murder his father. His father was elderly; a natural death wouldn't have been out of the question. And why the incestuous fascination with Lucilla? I didn't think it added anything to the movie - except to make Commodus even more repulsive. In the end, the movie didn't make me think about anything; it didn't challenge me with any moral decision-making; it didn't make choosing sides in this battle even remotely difficult.Don't get me wrong. This was a very good movie. One can always argue whether this movie or that should have been named best picture; one certainly has to agree that ""Gladiator"" was worthy of consideration. I just felt it could have been better. In the end, I give it a rating of 7/10.","

"copperccso","7 September 2002","I love history, and to me, Gladiator is a masterpiece. It is the most accurate picture of the Roman Empire Hollywood has ever put out.  People declare Spartacus a masterpiece, but Gladiator far outdoes Spartacus in quality.  The costuming, the acting, the screenplay, the scenery, and the fighting styles made me think that I had traveled back to 180 A.D. Russell Crowe is a true Hollywood tough guy, and he is superb in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as a villain, one of the best in movie history.  He played his character as if it were a psychologist's dream case. Connie Nielsen plays one of the strongest female characters that I have ever seen.  The choreographer of the action sequences was brilliant. Ridley Scott did an outstanding job in recreating the Empire, including the multitude of ethnic groups within the Empire and accurately depicting everyday life.  If you're looking for insight into what the Roman Empire was like, this is a perfect depiction.","

"john-collie-1","9 July 2023","In an age where CGI often overshadows storytelling, Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000) is a breath of fresh cinematic air. This historical epic, set in a tumultuous era of the Roman Empire, is a masterclass in filmmaking, showcasing an amalgamation of riveting performances, stunning visuals, and a score that stirs the soul.At the heart of Gladiator is Maximus Decimus Meridius, played with steely determination and compelling vulnerability by Russell Crowe. Crowe's performance is a spectacular tour de force, embodying a man whose honor, family, and freedom are taken from him. The depth of his character arc - from respected Roman general to enslaved gladiator, from broken man to symbol of hope - is beautifully depicted, earning Crowe a well-deserved Oscar.Opposite Crowe is Joaquin Phoenix as the power-hungry, emotionally unstable Emperor Commodus. Phoenix masterfully portrays a character that we love to hate, providing a worthy adversary for Crowe's Maximus. The scenes between the two are electric, the tension palpable.Visually, Gladiator is a spectacle to behold. The depiction of ancient Rome, from its grand coliseums to its war-torn battlefields, is rendered with incredible detail and authenticity. The gladiatorial combats are raw and thrilling, capturing the brutality and excitement of the Roman games. Scott doesn't shy away from the violence, but rather uses it to underline the brutality of the era and the courage of those who dared to defy it.Yet, it is the film's memorable score by Hans Zimmer that elevates Gladiator to an exceptional cinematic experience. From the melancholic ""Now We Are Free"" to the stirring ""Battle,"" Zimmer's soundtrack resonates, amplifying the emotion and gravitas of the narrative.The screenplay, too, deserves praise. Packed with memorable lines - ""What we do in life echoes in eternity,"" - it's a script that complements the grandeur of the film's visuals and performances.Gladiator is more than a movie; it's an experience. A return to the golden age of epic filmmaking, it provides an emotional depth often lacking in blockbuster fare. It's a tale of vengeance and redemption, of the struggle against tyranny, and of the resilience of the human spirit. Two decades on, its impact remains undiminished, solidifying its position as one of the most compelling films of the 21st century.","

"Mr_PCM","7 December 2005","If only Peter Jackson hadn't come along and done a rather good trilogy of films, we might possibly be talking about the greatest film of the 21st Century so far. Its sweeping but simplistic heroic tale, crunching fight scenes, award-winning special effects, towering acting and soaring score set this film apart from all the pretenders that followed it. Ridley Scott single-handedly re-invented the epic genre with this story of a Roman solider who is betrayed, loses everything and is sold into slavery, only to fight his way back as a gladiator, all the while driven by vengeance for his murdered family.Russell Crowe gives quite simply the performance of a lifetime as the Gladiator Maximus, one that deservedly won him Best Actor at the 2000 Academy Awards (although his performance in the following year's Beautiful Mind was arguably even better, even if it didn't win him his second consecutive Oscar), and provided a thinking woman's alternative to the likes of Pitt, Cruise and Clooney to swoon over. His gravely voice and impressive physique combine to give him a huge presence, which literally fills the screen. His dialogue is sparing, but his actions speak far louder, adding a stoic sadness to his vengeance-driven heroic character. Before Gladiator, Crowe was a good secondary actor; after Gladiator he was catapulted to the top of Hollywood's A-list, and remains there, thanks to this career-making performance proving him to be one of the finest actors of his generation.Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the scheming and corrupt Emperor Commodus who betrays Maximus and has his family killed. He manages to be delightfully and totally evil without ever descending into the realms of pantomime villain, which is a tricky line to walk, and manages to avoid being overshadowed by Crowe's monumental performance.The fight scenes are rousing and superbly choreographed, in particular a scene where Maximus marshals his fellow slaves into an army against marauding chariot archers in the Colosseum. The dialogue is kept simple and never overbearing (no need to worry why all of Europe speaks the same language) and culminates in one of the most memorable pieces of script that is destined to join the ranks of 'Play it Sam' and 'Are you talking' to me' as one of the most quoted (and misquoted) lines in movie history  although it is rather wordy. But here it is, in full; 'My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius. Commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true Emperor Marcus Aurelius; Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.' As Crowe turns to the Emperor in the arena and delivers this line, it proves to be one of the most electrifying moments in cinema history  hairs will stand up, spines will tingle, guaranteed.The action is set to some truly beautiful music, and it is shameful Hans Zimmer missed out on the Oscar for Best Score. Ridley Scott was similarly unlucky in the Director category.The film is however tinged with sadness, as it proved to be the final (but triumphant) swansong for the careers of Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, both of whom died shortly after making this film. Neither could have delivered much finer performances, and if any performance had to be a final one, both delivered one worthy of such a status here. Reed in particular is a revelation, reminding older generations and showing a new generation of his considerable talent.An inspiring film, rousing, exhilarating, exciting and moving. Superbly acted, directed, scored and visualised. A tribute to how great films could be once, and could be again.","

Scott's ""Gladiator"" is build around a mythic character, a man trying to find his way home... It is around someone finding inner strength in a tough time Maximus is somebody who doesn't want to be a soldier We realize this is a man who is pursuing the ultimate which is transcending death and finding love after death which completely transforms your reaction to the man, a man who is very, very strong but very, very loving The plot, familiar from Anthony Mann's "" Fall of the Roman Empire,"" had Crowe as Maximus, the proud well-loved Roman general in the army of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Maximus whose motto is 'Strength and Honor' is like a son to Aurelius, a statement that left Aurelius' own son, Commodus perturbed...Disappointed by the news that his father privately decides to name Maximus his successor, and being a young ambitious son lusting for power, he murders his father, and orders a strike against the general... One of the best scenes of the motion picture is where Commodus is told by his father that he is not going to be the emperor Joaquin Phoenix is easy to hate in a frightening and vile character...Ridley Scott creates a lot of beautiful scenes between the characters He did some fantastic work in all of those wonderful scenes in the film But there's another moment between the emperor and his daughter Lucilla (the Danish beauty Connie Nielsen) that I loved very much Harris says, ""Let's not speak of politics. Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter and I'm a good father. "" They walk for a few seconds and Lucilla says, ""This is a pleasant fiction."" I felt this short scene so sophisticated It seemed to me wonderfully insightful, simple in terms of amount of words, but complex in terms of understanding this strange relationship One of the most successful bits of casting was Oliver Reed He's a harsh and rough businessman who makes his living off the death machine and yet, inside, there was some kind of ethical person that would come out at the right momentRidley Scott's epic film does not romanticize a democratic Golden Age of Rome but a decaying, blood thirsty empire on the edge of its fall... Through its beautiful music, through Russell's performance and through Ridley's soulfulness, ""Gladiator"" brought a poetic vision in a new and very cinematically richly way that really gave the audience something different, so emotional and so intimate","

"almagz","19 November 2005","There is so little to find wanting in this film and not wanting to merely repeat its many deserved praises, all I can do is question a couple of historical points.It is unlikely that a Roman general would be sold into slavery and forced to fight in the arena. Exiled, yes. Killed maybe. Asked to commit suicide to retain his property, most likely. It is unlikely that he would return to find his family crucified, of all things. Romans were very specific about who got crucified and why. Romans usually avoided it, no matter how cruel the tyrant(?) was.Roman legionnaires would NEVER have a tattoo unless they were barbarians who got one BEFORE joining a legion. Marking or mutilating the human body was expressedly anti- Roman. No statue or depiction exists of a main-period Roman showing a body-marking. The bonding feature the writer was attempting was an inappropriate borrowing from the 20th century German SS.Great entertaining movie nonetheless.","

"BenNicholson123","8 November 2005","Gladiator! A thrilling tale of a Roman general who must battle against all thinkable odds to avenge the death of his family and restore justice to the empire. The plot is simple, legendary general Maximus Decimus Meridius, after many victorious campaigns and battles wants to return to his peaceful home in Spain, However the kind, fair and dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius wishes to bestow his title on him over his cruel son, Commodus. Commodus is understandably annoyed and kills his father calming the title of Emperor. Maximus is sentenced to death along with the rest of his family back at his home in Spain. Maximus escapes but is unable to save his wife and son. His loss of will to live makes him an east target for slavers and he is soon sold as a gladiator. He fights his way into the coliseum in Rome were he wins over the crowd and uses his celebrity status to defy the Emperor, to whom he swears his vengeance for the death of his family, after many battles and political backstabbing he gets his chance to fight the Emperor in the Arena.This is just such an amazing film, it captures every emotion possible in only the way an expert director can achieve, we can go on for whole scenes without the need for speaking, everything is told through the genuine body language and expressions. And when there is conversing we get such emotion and wonderfully powerful quotes  ""What we do in life, echoes in eternity"" Wow.The opening scene is spellbinding, showing the true gore of battle, the fight scenes are marvellously realistic, discarding the popular ""pretty"" sword fighting for brutal aggressive force. The audience in the arena express every emotion, surprise, anger, and enjoyment. The cast is brilliantly chosen; we can really see Russell Crowe as a gladiator, in Commodus, Joaquin Phoenix gives us a man we can really hate, Connie Nielson shows real emotion and passion in the role of Lucilla. So apart from the spellbinding acting, scarily realistic fight scenes and the amazing script, what else can we look for? The music is just stunning, its exactly what we need brought in at exactly the right time, truly wonderful directing. And then we have the stunning special effects, we can really visualise the greatness that is Rome, the fight scenes really make you believe. Some critics have condemned the lack of historical fact, for instance an emperor would never fight a gladiator, and these comments cannot be denied, its true.But I think we can forgive them that one fault for such an amazing movie. Without hesitation I give this movie a truly deserved 10/10!","

"IcyTones","27 November 2020","A movie where the featured Black guy is 'NOT' the first to die. Djimon Hounsou who plays Juba is a rising star that has swapped his life as a Catwalk Model & appearing in music videos for an acting career. He has been acting since 1997.
Juba is 'The Spaniard's' confidant whilst both serve as slaves. Both were sold to the local entrepreneur to fight as Gladiators.That unmistakable scar & voice of Oliver Reed was a surprise to see as this movie was recommended to me for 'the chariot race' scene. Twas good to see a veteran actor in this movie. Oliver Reed was to acting what George Best was to football. I always think that whatever major or minor roles veteran actors play, their names should come up first in the credits, but sadly not everyone shares this view.Although it's not a competitive race, there is a small 'Chariot Race' in the Coliseum Arena, but it's a race to kill the band of Gladiators stuck in the middle, before they get a chance to kill the Emperors league of marauders - in the name of 'sport'.The Emperor's son didn't just 'decide' to kill his father, he had a heart felt emotional son-to-father talk with his dad, who responded equally with the same heartfelt emotions of a father who knelt before his son to kinda ask for his son's forgiveness. A father who now acknowledges that he is as much to blame for shaping Commodus's wayward character, is a moment to be treasured. It's the father who has failed his son, not the son who has disappointed his father. The Emperor extended his arms to give his son a hug, but his son Commodus overcome with grief and jealousy at hearing the news that his father's general has been appointed by his father to temporarily rule Rome, he took the opportunity of an embrace to suffocate & kill his father and declare himself the new Emperor.If you lack the courage to be yourself, this movie can only but encourage you. In today's society education is a supportive aid to have a title & letters after your name. When asked to reveal himself, Maximus gave this whole spiel of who he was. Who are you? What goes before you? How do you want to introduce or refer to yourself? These were my thoughts!","

"wideawakedreamer","4 June 2000","The movie is the story of Maximus (Crowe), a general who leads the Roman army to victory over Germania in the beginning of the movie. The dying emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius, is watching this battle.The emperor's son, Commodus, then arrives with his sister Lucilla, and it is discovered that Commodus fully expects to be announced the new emperor of Rome in a few days. Aurelius, however, has other plans--he wants to make Maximus emperor, and requests that of the general, who wants nothing more than to go home to his family.I went into this movie having just watched Ben-Hur in my film studies class and having watched an episode of Xena only a couple of weeks earlier that featured the story of Marc Anthony and Cleopatra. So you could say I was in the perfect mindset to watch a ""sword-and-sandal"" movie. I wasn't sure what to expect, having somehow avoided all the hype that accompanied this movie. But I was not disappointed.Gladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The battle scenes are very graphic. (This movie is not for the squeamish, that's for sure.) There were some scenes in particular that really struck me, such as when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast.  The use of color and color tones added a great deal to the mood of the movie. Excellent.The script was being written and re-written as the filming was going on, yet it doesn't show that the actors had no idea how the movie was going to end when they began filming.  The acting is terrific. Russell Crowe is wonderfully cast as Maximus. Many reviewers agree that he is now officially a star. Joaquin Phoenix also proves his mettle as the emotionally troubled Commodus, whose behavior and emotion toward his sister could give anyone the creeps. Connie Nielsen makes you believe that, as Lucilla, she really is torn between natural loyalty to her brother and doing what she knows is right. Oliver Reed, in his last performance, is memorable in his role of Proximo, the former gladiator who is the owner of Maximus and brings him to Rome.  In short, the actors were brilliant in their roles, not over-acting, but giving subtle, strong performances.The script itself is very good.  Although some elements are a little hard to believe--the fact that no one recognizes Maximus when he's a slave?--this film calls for a willing suspension of disbelief, which one would happily comply with.  (It's really no fun to nitpick such a movie.)It's true that this movie does pretty much follow the Braveheart formula. However, this movie includes some elements, such as the cinematography and the incredibly graphic battle scenes (one reviewer likened it to Saving Private Ryan, ""only better""), that are spectacular in itself. Overall, a great movie that I highly recommend.","

"SayitasIseeit","16 December 2020","Despite its predecessors, Gladiator has managed to hold its own against many box office hits of today. Russel Crowe acting his heart out in one of the most well cast and filmed epics of a generation.I would most definitely rather watch this than some half thrown together medieval war movie of modern day.

"comingaround","19 August 2000","This is wonderful storytelling.  The opening Battle Scene simply mesmerizes, showing the brutal nature of combat for Roman conquests.  I went back to see the film again.  The first time I didn't hear anything Crowe said before the battle.  I was just too visually caught-up.  The second time I listened very closely and caught the wise yet succinct line from Maximus ""what we do in life... echoes in eternity.""  Awesome.A simple man v. an emperor.  I just loved the resilience Maximus showed throughout the movie.  I find in most movies, there is an irritatingly slow process where the character has to ""find himself,"" not so with Gladiator. Maximus does what is needed.I liked how there were only two or three issues within this film.  One was the afterlife.  Aspects of the afterlife are opened, but not overdone.  Love of family is given sizable focus. I liked the theme of love of country that we see as well, although it may not be justly deserved, it is never questioned.The visual effects were amazing.  It actually had me wanting to believe that's the way Rome actually looked in all it's glory.  The battle of Carthage reenactment was really great.The ending is just hypnotic. Intentionally or unintentionally it was simply emotional.  The music is wonderfully beautiful as if Maximus' family are telling him...you have arrived.Bottom line: magnificent.  Visually and emotionally satisfying.","

"TheNabOwnzz","21 April 2019","Gladiator is not just director Ridley Scott's ultimate masterpiece ( And i am also keeping the fantastic Alien & Blade Runner in mind when i say this ), it is also undoubtedly one of the most viscerally effective and emotionally compelling of motion pictures ever made.It plays somewhat like a modern Ben-Hur, as a very respectable character is forced into slavery due to him standing up for what is right. Of course, being a much more modern epic, the editing is a lot quicker, as is the entire pace of the picture. However,with 171 minutes playtime in the extended edition, Scott doesn't haste through this picture, and takes his time to set up his characters & their respective arcs. Gladiator is however not a flawless film, as several action sequences ( Particularly in the introduction in the battle of Germania ) feature quite a lot of shaky cam and quick editing, but admittedly this is nowhere near as bad as something like Taken or The Bourne Trilogy. Most of the action sequences are superbly edited, with widescreen shots to create an overview, combined with mediums to immerse the viewer into the action. A couple of times there is a shakycam shot in the middle of this, but it's a very minor issue. Another minor fault is in some of the backdrops. The 'Am i not merciful' scene features an obvious greenscreen, saturated a bit too brightly, and Proximo is obviously not physically there near the end of the film ( When actor Oliver Reed had already died ). Again these minor issues feature only in 1 scene respectively, and therefore do not really do anything to truly diminish the cinematic power that Gladiator provides.On the whole, the cinematography & art direction of Gladiator is impeccable. It is not the best, since as stated before there are a couple of lesser backdrops easily recognizable as greenscreens, but for most of the picture the viewer is subjected to beautiful angles, backdrops & sets. The scenes in Zuccabar are an example of the seductive natural beauty Gladiator provides, and Maximus's ride to his family after his execution attempt also feature some stunning environmental shots. Sets are elegantly crafted and varied in a beautiful color palette, becoming most apparent in Commodus's & Lucilla's scenes. The titanic image of the Colosseum is also one that is difficult to get rid of, despite the fact that i believe it was filmed in full CGI, but apart from perhaps the absolute final shot ( Burying the sculptures ), that is hardly noticable.The art of acting is utilized at its finest in Gladiator, with three absolute superb performances by leads Russel Crowe as Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus & Connie Nielsen as Lucilla. Not to mention the fantastic supporting performances of legendary actor Richard Harris & Oliver Reed. Crowe is the epitome of a brick of stoic masculinity, yet he gave an utterly convincing and extended sob fest when gazing upon the sight of his crucified family, showing us his versatility as an actor. We see him win a battle against Germanians through his discipline, intelligence and courage, and we are rooting for his character from this moment forth. He is in his heart a simple man that just wants to go home to his family, but he is also honor bound to Rome, and proves this through his courageous actions. Not interested by the corruptions of power, he lives only to see justice done. Phoenix is superb as the corrupted emperor, showing us his envy of Maximus simply with one look into the eyes ( Look at Phoenix's superb facial acting in the scene where Maximus reveals himself to him in the arena ), his arrogance & his brutality. Nielsen is also quite underrated, as her disguised fear during every scene with her brother after their father's death is a stunning feat of acting within acting, culminating with her utter terror at the end when Commodus demands a 'pure blood' heir with her.Of course one cannot forget Hans Zimmer's fantastic contribution to his masterpiece, creating arguably his finest score to date, with this especially being the case during the transition between the (Again) 'Am i not merciful' scene and the shots of the arena. Obviously 'Now we are free' is also one of the most emotionally powerful scores ever created. It is also one of Zimmer's most varied scores, as a slight criticism of him is often his repeated melodies ( Admittedly, a lot of the themes in Gladiator still sound similar to The Rock, but a lot of them also do not ). In any case, it is rare to imagine the brilliance and emotional resonance of Gladiator without Zimmer's score.While the narrative is fairly straightforward as a revenge story, the dialogue written is superb, with many incredible lines such as 'What we do in life, echoes in eternity', not to mention the slow character development and character arcs, even within seemingly minor characters like Proximo & Quintus ( You will need to see the extended edition to witness Quintus's arc ) who have their original ideals challenged and overcome throughout the events in the film. Even though Maximus's sole purpose in life has become to kill Commodus in revenge for his family, it is in a way a very hopeful film. A film about standing up for what is right, and being granted redemption and a reunion with loved ones in the end. Maximus does not want to rule Rome, but in slaying Commodus, he secures the feature of it for is people, while also acquiring his personal goal. He demands respect for his valor and his morals throughout the film, and this makes sure that we as an audience are emotionally drained by the time he enters the Elysium fields, and is hailed as a hero by the people of Rome, and a hero he was.One of the all-time greats of epic motion pictures, Gladiator features impeccable acting, writing ,cinematography, art direction & a phenomenal original score. It also features possibly the most relatable main character ever written, which is partly why there are very little films that can equal the emotional power that Gladiator creates.","

"screenman","6 January 2008","Evaluating opinion of this movie by the 'Hated It' selection, I lost count of the number of contributors who gave it just one star. I thought they were being unnecessarily 'Roman' in their ruthlessness, but the result does show how disappointed so many viewers were and the extent to which this movie has polarised opinion.I diplomatically place myself somewhere in the middle.For me, scepticism set-in at the outset. That much-vaunted battle scene didn't sit right at all. In combat, the greatest Roman strength lay in the legion. The scrupulously drilled and disciplined foot-soldiers worked in unison, advancing upon enemies in their orderly units and maniples.Their Shields interlocked to create a mobile wall that could form-up on all flanks and even provide overhead protection. In between, they used their short, stabbing swords.The legions, then, were only at their best in the open. In dense forest, their advantages would have been squandered, any fight being a brawl upon the same terms as the enemy. Morover, their big Shields would have been an encumbrance and the short swords inadequate. A good Roman general drew the enemy out to fight on his terms, not the other way round. I'm not a scholar of Roman warfare; it may be there were occasions when Romans had no choice, but this is where the question marks began to pop-up. Check out the impeccable piece in 'Spartacus', where the Roman legions deploy by the textbook, drawing their enemy down from the hill. Perhaps Mr Scott felt that a more faithful rendering would seem like too much of a rip-off. In any case, this battle is quite incidental, and seems to exist only to grip the viewer's attention for the next couple of flatulent hours.Neither was I aware that the Roman army employed fire-bombs. It's not for me to say they didn't, but I have no reference to this tactic at all.I thought Ridley Scott made a futile attempt to create an 'arty' film. The frequent dream-like flashbacks to a hand running through spears of corn reminded me of the recurrent unicorn dream from his fascinating but equally pretentious 'Blade Runner'. From time to time there's even the same high-pitched warbling 'oriental' chorus, intended to project mood, but failing again. Some directors don't seem to realise that cinema-goers have memories.General Gruntus Maximus (Russel Crowe) surely got the easiest Oscar in history. He was believable as an uneducated slob in the way, perhaps, Spartacus should have been; but cerebral enough to be a general? I don't think so. And you don't rise to be a career general in an army whilst obsessing as a farmer about your harvest. You're either one, or the other.There was one particularly absurd scene in the arena when he was chopping-down competitors as quickly as they could be set against him. What then - weren't they trained gladiators, too? I was half-expecting him to begin walking sideways along the arena walls like 'Neo' from 'Matrixus'.As to the 'spectacle' of Rome; well, that was all just computer-generated hokum. The back-room boys can whip-up anything in that way now just by tapping a few keys, so what's the big deal? Check-out the 'real' thing in 'Fall Of The Roman Empire'.As with 'Titanic' and 'Pearl Harbour' a splendid opportunity was missed here to do something really wonderful, but because of flawed vision and misplaced directorial self-belief we finished up with mediocrity. Glorious mediocrity.Still, bread and circuses usually please the crowds.","

"PyroSikTh","30 August 2021","Gladiator deserves every ounce of praise it got at the time (and debatably deserved more), and still gets to this day. It's a stirring story of revenge against the backdrop of Roman glory, with a game played off between the stoicism of Maximus against the cruel envy of Commodus over the people's adoration. It becomes as much about the back-alley politicking and public perceptions as it does the fights within the arena itself. Maximus is the pinnacle of masculinity and heroism against Commodus' despicable antagonist, an underdog against powers greater than himself. And when Maximus gets his revenge and collapses on the floor to meet his wife and son in the afterlife, it hits with the emotional weight it has earned. It's beautiful to look at, gorgeous to listen to, expertly directed and edited. I give Gladiator a resounding 9/10.","

"tedg","14 May 2000","Regular readers of my comments note my penchant for pointing out that film is a modern medium, meaning that films -- good ones anyway -- are often largely about themselves. When the nature of this self-comment is interesting, I point it out. But I failed to do so in an earlier comment on Gladiator, so here is the remedy.Summer movies target the lowest of our sensibilities. The plots are highly simplified morality plays where good and evil are radically drawn; the form is of violent spectacle. In other words, our civilized society wants the same things we observe in later Rome, to which we insist on feeling superior.So the master Scott gives us a violent spectacle about a violent spectacle. He makes fun of us by pandering to our baser tastes while slyly getting us to agree with the wise senator who observes how simple, stupid and manipulable is the mob. He did much the same in Blade Runner, but there the comment was on the sharpness, complexity of the audience not its dullness.
Is this a maturing cynicism, an adventure into a new challenge (mastering the art of painting with a blunt palette), or a striking out against Hollywood's financial politics? I suppose we've have to wait a decade to find out -- until after the power-hungry Caesars die and the medium is returned to the enlightened leaders of the people.","

"planktonrules","12 February 2012","Visually, ""Gladiator"" is a masterpiece. I saw a documentary about how they made this film long before I saw the actual movie and it's amazing to see how they used CGI to construct an enormous FULL stadium even though most of it wasn't real! The costumes, props, chariots and trappings were also gorgeous--as good as anything you'll ever see in a film about ancient Rome. And, with some spectacular stunts and TONS of blood, it is brutal--but spectacularly brutal. You really have to see this film and it will knock your socks off.If you look at my summary, however, I say that the film is a bit disappointing as well. As a retired history teacher, I know that much of the history shown in this film is wildly inaccurate. It bears only a very superficial semblance to the facts and it's a shame, as the true story of Emperor Commodus would make for an exciting film. In addition, at times I felt as if the dialog was just awful. Too often, folks talks as if they were making speeches or delivering lines in a high school play. And, it turns out I am not alone. After the film, I read through the IMDb trivia and noticed that the actors ALSO hated the dialog and much of it was changed....though in my opinion, not enough of it was changed. There was often no emotion other than rage or boredom from Maximus, for example. His grief at the crucifixion of his family sounded LESS emotional than it should have--like he was upset that the commissary forgot to but cheese on his burger--not like a man grief-stricken with loss. Simply put, the human side to the film is stilted.So what you are left with is a WILDLY exciting film--a true spectacle. But it lacks the humanity and truth that would have made it even better. Still, it's well worth seeing.","

"Jetset971","14 May 2010","I have had a great deal of discussions with people about this film. I agree it is a good movie. Its entertaining, action packed, worth the price of a ticket. However, I don't think I have ever seen a movie win so many awards without questioning the validity. Gladiator, while still a good film, is hardly deserving of all its accolades. I mean it might be worthy of winning cinematography or production awards or special effects but Best picture? Best Actor? I could think of a 100 other movies in the year 2000 more deserving than this movie. Don't misunderstand, I like this movie, but the problem is that movie awards like the Oscars,presumably, are there to honor high quality and High achievements in each respected field. Russel Crowe does an adequate job, but his acting in his other Oscar nominated films like ""The Informant"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"" were light years ahead of his performance in ""Gladiator"". Furthermore, Giving best picture to this film was mind boggling. I personally feel that the only reason this movie was even in the running at all, was because of the money it made. It was a good action movie and nothing more. Hey, remember that ""Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" was also up for best picture that year. In my opinion, It ran circles around ""Gladiator"". Wheras ""Gladiator' was just a good action film. CTHD was a phenomenal action movie and love story and should have won the top prize.","

What really touched me was the moment when he touched the wheat waves dancing with the wind, looked at the blue gray sky in the distance, and slowly set foot on the way home under the eyes of his wife and children.

"chrisbrown6453","8 June 2001","Gladiator is a truly great depiction of an important part of early Roman Empire. Yes, Gladiator will probably win the Oscar of Best Picture of 2000, but should it?  While I agree that watching it was a great pleasure, I am not convinced that it was the best movie made last year.  In any other year, not containing a film named Cast Away', Gladiator would get my absolute vote, however in the interest of keeping this review to the movie at hand, I will not name which one I feel should win.Viewing Gladiator was definitely a spectacle everyone should endure. It has everything any good movie should; an original story, great acting, and truly awe-inspiring direction.  To be transported to a world that existed over 1800 years ago, and experience the very same excitement the Romans were able to enjoy is just incredible.  Ridley Scott struck did very well with his direction of Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Neilsen, and Oliver Reed (who unfortunately suffered a fatal heart attack during filming).  Scotts' ability to `see' the action in his head, and create the effect for the cameras is wonderful.  This is a far different epic than Alien', and far better than Hannibal'. 
Russell Crowe is fabulous as Maximus Meridius, the great soldier planning to return to his home after fighting his last battle only to find himself thrust between the dead kings will for him to become the new king, and Commudus, the son of the former king wanting him to stay and fight for him. Crowe is perfect in this role, he is strong, rugged looking, and has become quite a good actor since his days in The Quick and the Dead' and the awful Virtuosity'.Joaquin Phoenix is magnificent in his role as Commudus.   Only recently have I noticed what great acting skills Phoenix possesses, and how well he transforms into such diverse characters, such the same can be said of Ewan McGregor and his diverse roles in Trainspotting', Little Voice' and Star Wars: Episode I'.  Phoenix's ability to present himself in such a devious and hateful aspect is awe-inspiring.  As the sister of Commudus, Lucilla (Connie Neilsen) has to play both devoted to her brother, and sympathetic to Maximus.  Neilsen pulls this off beautifully and she is very convincing in her role.The story is beautifully written, and there is never a dull moment.  After I viewed the film for the first time I felt that the gladiator fight scenes were too far apart, and not enough of them were in the movie.  However, a very good friend of mine, we shall call him Michael DeZubiria (check out his reviews), felt it necessary to explain to me that Gladiator is not just a story about fighting, but a story about the life struggles of one man and his quest to avenge the brutal killing of his family. 
Now, while I admit that I liked this film, I am not ready, nor will I ever be ready, to call it the best movie of 2000 (see my Cast Away review).  I do not want to take anything away from Gladiator, it's just that there was a more original, creative film in 2000.","

"cutter-12","29 March 2002","There is much to appreciate about about this picture but at the same time there is much to castigate as well. What could have been a thoroughly involving story turns out to be crippled by a lean script, some very indecisive direction and choppy editing. Not to mention some bad casting in the form of Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, a role which cries out to have been the last role played by Anthony Quinn.The film starts out well and looks bleakly authentic in its depiction of the pivotal battle in the wars between the barbarian tribes of Germania and the Roman Empire. But as the story gives way to 40 minutes of exposition following Commodus and Lucilla's introduction, Ridley Scott seems to tack things on whenever the script runs into weak spots. This leaves the film without a flowing narrative and it seems to want to please a mindless summer movie action market while at the same time aspiring to be something deeper. What it leaves us with is a schizophrenic, unequivocal story full of contradictions. There seems to be an epidemic in the past three or four years - films like this, Titanic, The Patriot, Pearl Harbor, Enemy at the Gates etc, try hard to be great epic films but at their core they are very slight and even trivial. The story in Gladiator holds promise but what little conflict there is set up and thrown at us in the first hour, leaving just a linear resolution to unfold for the remainder. A shame because so many elements could have been introduced in this story to make it truly an awesome and thoughtful epic. I guess complex stories like Spartacus and Ben-Hur will never be made again. This one falls somewhere short, though better than Demitrius and the Gladiators and the film it heavily borrows its narrative structure from - The fall of the Roman Empire.Technically the CGI is at times seamless and other times poor. When our troop of Gladiators run into the colosseum for the first time however the effect is absolutely jaw dropping and the scene that follows certainly delivers the action goods. The acting is very good throughout except for Tomas Arana as Quintus (about as bad as John Dall in Spartacus) and the aforementioned Richard Harris. Like Braveheart, not a bad entertainment experience but highly Hollywoodized and with an uneven narrative. But unlike Braveheart, the ending to Gladiator is a just a little embarrassing as it rips off both Braveheart and Titanic to far less effect. If you can get past the flaws, not the worst Roman spectacle on offer. Too highly rated at 8.1/10.","

"Hancock_the_Superb","21 December 2007","In Rome circa 185 AD, General Maximus (Russell Crowe) leads a successful expedition against Germanic tribes in the northern empire. Dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) confides that he is to succeed as Emperor, to the chagrin of the vain, ego-maniacal Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who kills Marcus and usurps the throne. Maximus is expelled from the army, his family is killed, and he ultimately ends up in Rome as a gladiator for Proximo (Oliver Reed). Defying the will of the Emperor and eager to have his revenge, Maximus becomes a hero to the masses and joins Commodus's sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and a cabal of Senators led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) in an attempt to bring down Commodus.Gladiator is something of a paradox. As a well-made, entertaining action film, it's hard to beat. Its attempts to be something more, however... not so much. It's very entertaining, an excellent crowd-pleaser to be sure, but it's far from the great film it's widely considered to be.Gladiator wants to be something significant. Its multi-faceted plot, its commentary on society, its distinguished cast of actors, epic battle scenes, and great musical score almost push it there. The movie borrows heavily from ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" (settings and characters), ""Spartacus"" and ""Ben-Hur"" (for the plot). This is not a criticism, merely an observation. And the movie does have an inkling of being something more than just another action movie. And yet it fails, because at heart it is basically ""Braveheart"" in a toga.Perhaps I'm just not enthralled by the film's basic storyline. See if this sounds familiar: A successful warrior who wants only to live in peace is roused to ass-kicking action by the death of his family at the hands of cartoonishly evil villains. This is the plot of ""Braveheart"", ""The Patriot"", and innumerable Westerns, action films, and Steven Seagal/Chuck Norris slugfests. Death of family members is an easy motivation for a character, and dare I suggest a lazy one. Maximus isn't a thoughtful, conflicted hero like T.E. Lawrence or Spartacus, he's just a man of action who wants to wreak vengeance on those who wronged him. In spite of its attempts to convince us otherwise, the movie is basically a Schwarzenegger or Van Damme flick set in Roman times with a lead actor who can act.The subplots of the film don't fare much better. The character of Commodus in particular is a disappointment. One of the few good things about ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" is Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Commodus. Commodus is an egomaniac with delusions of grandeur. He's not horribly complex in that film but Plummer makes it work. Whether it's the script or Joaquin Phoenix's acting, this film's Commodus is a sniveling weakling. I appreciate the effort to give him motivation (his father never truly loved him) but in his big scene with Marcus Aurelius, Commodus doesn't come across as heart-broken, merely insincere. Commodus is a petulant child who lacks menace. David Schofield's duplictious Senator Falco is a much more effective bad guy. The Senate plot against the Emperor is under-developed and comes across as a bad pastiche of ""Spartacus"".On a purely action level, the movie is pretty good. The epic battle which opens the film is not particularly impressive in my opinion, but the gladiator combats later in the film are impressive. The visceral thrill of a gladiatorial match comes across well, particularly when Proximo's gladiators ""upset"" an enemy team. The fight between Maximus and the ""Tigress of Gaul"" is very well-handled, as is the final duel between Commodus and Maximus. The CGI is of mixed quality. It's impressive in some scenes (notably Commodus's entry into Rome) but in other parts it's murky and distracting. Hans Zimmer's score is haunting and helps drive the film's more powerful moments.The movie excels largely because of Russell Crowe. FOTRE failed because Stephen Boyd is a block of wood; Crowe, playing a very similar role, excels. Maximus is not a particularly noble hero but he's a fabulous action star, and Crowe does bring a degree of intelligence and complexity to complement the ass-kicking. The supporting cast is mostly under-used. Djimon Honsou, Oliver Reed, David Schofield and Derek Jacobi give the most memorable supporting performances in the film despite very limited screen time. Richard Harris is disappointing as Marcus Aurelius, and Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen aren't particularly compelling either.""Gladiator"" is one of the best action films ever made, on a purely action level. But in its attempts to be something more... well, not so much, I'm afraid.7/10","

"Hitchcoc","23 October 2001","I never got around to seeing this in the theater. I'm sure it's a marvelous spectacle on the big screen. I don't know what it was. I found the acting good, the spectacle and special effects outstanding, the hero one we could cheer for. Why, then, do I feel so empty? Was it all the hype, best picture of the year? I just don't know. It was totally predictable. There were absolutely no surprises. After seeing The Patriot and realizing both movies have the same plot, I expected something more. Why are evil Roman Emperors always portrayed as cowardly wimps? I still don't believe that he actually was willing to go into the arena with Maximus. He wouldn't have anything to do with war. There is the obligatory killing of the family. That goes back to Macbeth folks. If a ruler wants to stay a ruler, leave the family alone. I know it's just to show how evil and powerful the Emperor is, but do you want the top general in the army gunning for you?--this will guarantee it. There is masterful cinematography in this film. The scenes of violence are masterful. Although once you've seen one fountain of blood spouting up, you've seen them all--one decapitation is like another. What I wanted was to see the characters really dealing with the evil of the times and confronting it. There is always that army out there ready to be commanded again. There is always the possibility that the greatest empire in the world can be destroyed by one guy (like when Mel Gibson won the Revolutionary War all by himself). I think this is really quite a good film. But I don't see it as deserving to be named the best of any year. We've come to demand a movie that looks good rather than one that grasps our heart.","

"CherryBlossomBoy","22 October 2006","There is an unwritten rule in movie making that if you have an excellent script it doesn't matter how you film it. If you have a lousy script - then everything else matters, the direction, the cinematography, the acting, the music... ""Gladiator"" is an epitome of the latter half of that rule. The case where direction, music, acting and art direction completely redeemed a crappy story.For me it took watching it in German overdubbing. As I don't speak German there was nothing to detract me from visuals and music. And it's a new experience on another level. But more on that later. First the crappy part. The story.Make no mistake, whether you care about history or not, this is a horrible script. It's taking huge (and quite unacceptable) liberties with the period it purports to portray, it's unconvincing even on its own terms, the dialog is pretty much high school and in its core it's a predictable revenge story told a zillion times before. Apparently (according to a documentary about Hollywood screenwriters) only Russell Crowe didn't know what turd the script was so he contributed himself with the juvenile ""husband of the dead wife"" speech.Ridley Scott and his crew apparently knew what stinker they had to work with and did their best to defeat it with excellence in all areas and actually made two films in one.On the surface it's a revenge story. The hero, a favorite army general turned gladiator, seeks revenge against a young emperor, who had general's family killed during the tumultuous succession to the throne. The military battles and the gladiatorial bouts required for this aspect of the movie are done both to tremendous detail and on a grand scale. With the help of CGI they are seen in all their glory and gore. Some accuse Scott of shying away from action but his direction shows everything one needs to see. Yes, the cuts are brief, the camera sometimes doesn't follow through, but the editing is pure poetry and you miss nothing. Cinematography-wise every frame is shot in a way that you could just hang it on a wall as a nice picture. Costumes and scenery are impeccable. A revenge story, yes, but well worth watching.But on another level ""Gladiator"" plays out like a remake of ""Fall of a Roman Empire"". But it's not in the script. It's in the mood set again by production. This other story is about the decline and death of classical Rome and its ideals. There is simple yet effective symbolism to express it, the play on dark and light and the sunrise-sunset arc. The movie starts with a battle at dawn, the way the Rome itself had once dawned, fighting. There is an ideal Roman hero, valiant and dutiful, there's a typical Roman villain, clandestine and scheming. Hero does his best in the light, the villain does his worst in the dark, whenever they swap environments during the movie they fail miserably. The story ends at sunset, symbolizing the end of the Empire itself, and although an uplifting speech is given at that point it is defeated by the setting sun.The feeling of the doom is constantly emphasized by melancholic music. The dreamlike experience of the main character who is already dead but doesn't yet know it is enhanced when he finally visits Rome and the city is an idealistic, blown in proportions version of itself. The script may be a complete falsification of history, but the feeling of decline one gets when watching those scenes is probably completely faithful.So forget the story and the closing speech. Watch and listen the movie. The Roman Empire is living and dying once more before your very eyes.","

"spaulagain","21 September 2020","While Gladiator is traditional (if not basic) in its overall plot, the characters and performances bring the trophy home in this film. Beautifully shot, with just the right amount of violence and emotion, it's a good technical film as well. Some may find parts of it to be a little cheesy, or some of the side characters to just be meh, those flaws are greatly overshadowed by the leads.Crowe is fantastic of course, but Joaquin Phoenix steals the film with an incredible performance as Commodus. From his first scene, to the last, you build an intense hate for his character. His creepy nature just rubs it all in.This was the first film I saw (when it came out) that I then knew of Phoenix's skills and potential. He's been a favorite ever since.","

"tedg","7 May 2000","Two things about this film intrigue me: the novel integrated talents of Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe.We are creatures who depend on idea fragments in everything we do. Virtually everything is a rehash, sometimes creative but mostly not. When someone or something comes along and adds to the vocabulary, something essentially new, it is a big deal -- that's my definition of genius. Today, a major force in defining our basic vocabulary is cinema, the visual element of filmaking. But all the easy stuff has been done as we leave the first generations of the art.So when someone comes along who can conceive a world that is new and unfamiliar, and who can actually deliver the illusion of being in that world, it is notable. Scott does that here (and in Blade Runner). Kubrick did it once or maybe twice; Polanski had the skills when he had an edge, but this is exceedingly rare. Note here how little quoting Scott does of prior battle in his battle scene, how Ben Hur (and all the lesser period pieces) are not at all referenced. How new this all is. (The only concession is the annoying British accent of the Romans.)What is remarkable is that it is all visual. It is not in the writing, the effects per se, or the acting, though they are all good enough. I intend to see this film several more times for just the visual experience. I suspect that because of the coherence and advance of the visual vocabulary. this will be seen as a landmark film long after Private Ryan and Titanic become footnotes.But there is also Crowe, and there's something notable here. I don't see great acting in the normal sense, but there is something else, and this seems new to me as well. To check this, I reviewed LA Confidential and The Insider. Crowe has the ability to develop tension, a normal enough skill, but he also has the ability to project this tension into the environment of the film. Watch how the scenes flow as his acting in one scene is tossed into another; it's remarkable.When he did this in The Insider, he seems to use as his resonator the unwitting, ever-bombastic Pacino. Here, He uses the similar exaggerated scope of the story, both the setting and the violence of the context.WARNING! Spoilers follow:Both Scott and Crowe seem to know what they are doing. So they have eliminated many of the elements normally required: there is no backstory, no explanation of what went before, no comic relief, just the barest of scaffolding. But in that, it is made of huge, strong girders. In another film, we'll have revenge driven by the death of the Hero's wife. Here, she and their child are gang-raped, burned until nearly dead, then crucified. In another film, the bad guy is conventionally bad, but here we have patricide and incestual rape. In another period film, we'd have lots of street scenes (which are cheap) to convey a sense of place: not so here. Nothing not essential to the core projection and resonant backdrop are used. So instead of parading the effects (as with Titanic or Jurassic Park), they are handled casually, incidentally as background. Just a huge visual sweep through which tension is passed. It is early to know, but this could be one of the great films.","

"shahrad","2 February 2001","Gladiator is one of those movies that  tries to present a splendid old story with today standards of film making so younger persons of our time could be impressed by that too. well, what do you expect? Gladiator tries to be(or imitate) something like Ben Hur and Spartacus but fails in many ways. I agree that the visual effects are amazing, but the score is not a masterpiece and the most important thing-in my idea-the screenplay is too ordinary and has nothing particular and new to present. It seems that the real point of killing Maximus is to make audiences cry.( I couldn't find any other reason to get him killed). But, in some ways the movie is worth watching. I claim that I bought the tape of the movie, because I felt that my library needed it.","

There was some movies that came close to this one, but never enjoyed one more than Gladiator. As soon as the movie starts, it takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions, suspense and excitement. The story is just beautiful and the whole setting is perfect. Russell Crowe gives his absolute best and you can see that clearly.
This is an example of how a movie should be, Gladiator is a masterpiece.","

"tieman64","26 February 2012","""Father, I would have butchered the whole world...if you would only love me."" - Commodus Ridley Scott directs ""Gladiator"". The film's influenced by Cecil B. DeMille's epics (""The Crusades"", ""The Sign of the Cross""), and Italian/Hollywood sword-and-sandal movies (""Spartacus"", ""Ben Hur"", ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"", ""El Cid"", ""Barabbas"", ""Demetrius and the Gladiators"" etc), all films Scott adored as a child. As with Scott's other historical epics (""Conquest of Paradise"", ""Robin Hood"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven""), artwork and paintings the director came across as an art student seem to be a big influence, in this case the works of Jean-Leon Gerome (Scott's acknowledged Gerome's ""Pollice Verso"" as the reason he decided to direct ""Gladiator""), 19th century Orientalists, Charles Gleyre, Caravaggio and Delaroche.Of course the chief pleasure of any Scott movie is his emulation of famous painters and/or print artists. Think ""Blade Runner's"" nods to Edward Hopper, Enki Bilal and Jean Giraud (Moebius), ""Alien's"" reliance on Giger's ""Necronomicon"", and ""The Duellist's"" nods to Caspar David Friedrich and Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon's"", another painterly film, though Kubrick subverts the idyllic charms of Gainsborough and Watteau, whereas Scott goes for straight Romanticism (his final shot's a direct copy of Friedrich's ""Wanderer above the Sea of Fog""). The problem, though, is that Scott's images can never touch any of these other artists. Worse still, they're always aligned to silly screenplays.""Gladiator"" stars Russell Crowe as Maximus, the Roman general asked by the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius to take over as ruler of Rome. Before he is granted power, however, the emperor's tyrannical son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix, playing Commodus with severe daddy issues), orders the execution of Maximus and his family. Maximus survives, and embarks on a quest for vengeance. The film watches as Maximus falls from general to slave, rises from slave to gladiator and finally from gladiator to brave warrior who dares defy an emperor. The film ends with Maximus given a messianic, ""Braveheart""/""Spartacus"" inspired slow death.Great visuals and sequences are scattered about, but Scott's CGI lacks the gravity of even the FX work DeMille did a century earlier, the film is surprisingly stiff for an ""action epic"", ""Gladiator's"" adherence to old Hollywood storytelling, spectacle and violence makes it an immediately dated affair and Scott's dialogue reads like a bad stage-play (""Sometimes I do what I want to do, the rest of the time I do what I have to""), devoid of depth, nuance or wit. The film's overall tone is a cross between a WWF wrestling match and a perfume commercial, Scott dressing things up in a New Age score, gauzy filters, long focal lenses, ubiquitous smoke, flares and mist. It's ""Braveheart"" with less camp value. Like DeMille, what you mostly marvel at is the sheer scale of the production, though in our era of excess, such logistics have lost much of their weight.Hollywood isn't known for treating history seriously, but ""Gladiator"" is funny in the way it bulldozes yesteryear. The film ends with the fictional Maximus killing the real Emperor Commodus in gladiatorial combat, a mano-a-mano scenario that's the equivalent of Indiana Jones killing Hitler in a game of ping pong. Lucilla, the sister of Commodus (who had actually been executed at the beginning of Commodus' reign), then announces that Rome will ""honor Maximus"" by ""reversing Commodus' despotism"" and ""restoring the greatness of the Republic"". What the hell? The film somehow manages to turn Maximus' death (lots of Christian and crucification iconography) into a ""hero dying for the sins of Rome"" narrative, Maximus' death steering a resurrected Rome away from corruption and toward its supposedly saintly, Republican origins (historically, it was when Rome became a Republic that it turned into a psycho-expanding Empire, and it was as a Republic, and not while under dictatorial rule, that she was at her most bloody). You saw the same thing years ago with British Imperial nostalgia, Britain romanticising its colonial achievements and declaring them a proper source of pride, and today in the US with desires for ""strict constitutionalists"" and a return to those ""good old days"". You know, when you could own a slave and scalp Injuns. So by the film's end, ""Gladiator"" has turned the historical fall of the Roman Empire into Rome's ""purification"" and ""rebirth"" via the ""true warrior son"" of a ""departed Emperor"" ""nobly returning"" and replacing a ""bad, fake, fascist Emperor"". Cue psycho-expansionist George Bush Jr's coincidental ascension to the throne the same year Scott's film was released. It's what daddy wanted.End result: a violent Hollywood spectacle about the violent spectacle of gladiatorial combat, which makes fun of art which panders to the mob, whilst nevertheless glorifying violence, ""glory"", ""honor"" and the prosperity of Roman Imperialism. Note the way the simple, bare-bones existence of Maximus (the guy literally rallies his troops by stressing his love for simple, subsidence farming) is contrasted with Commodus' extravagance. Commodus may prove that the dumb masses only enjoy bread and circus antics, but Maximus trumps this by gaining support through the universal love for the simple, martial virtues that supposedly made Rome great. These virtues were more heroically illustrated by the Germanic fighters and Celtic tribes (ironic: ""Gladiator"" catapulted Celtic singer Enya to super-stardom), quickly slaughtered by Scott, who were defending themselves against Rome at the beginning of the film. 7.5/10 - Worth two viewings. See 1964's ""Becket"" and 1968's ""The Lion In Winter"".","

"sonofhades","7 June 2001","If you know ANYTHING about the history of Rome, please do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie.Lets see: Film opening sequence. General Maximus speaks such nonsense about troops, casualties etc. The massive battle in the movie would have been fine if they didn't have archers or catapults in the scene. After that, they should have used the scene in ""braveheart"", instead of a film about Romans.Remember that Roman army didn't charge into combat without controlled formations? Not considering this fact, the battle is the BEST part of the film. After this incident, the plot of the movie is sooooo predictable, as if the manuscript had been written by someone with the imagination of 12 year old child.Actors then...I have only seen worse acting performed by mr. Sylvester Stallone than the Aussie playing the role of Maximus. Even a wooden log could have put more feeling into the scene when he finds his family slaughtered. Besides, he rode a huge journey in one day, came to the smoking ruins of his villa from a distance of 1000 klicks (try that yourself).And the final scene: Emperor challenging a gladiator into a duel, how stupid is that? This movie has the same value as a historical movie as Rambo III.","

"JoeB131","20 April 2010","As a Roman History Buff, the ending destroyed it. You have the ending where the fictional Maximus kills Commodus (a real Roman Emperor) in gladiatorial combat. (Commodus was actually strangled in his bath when poison wasn't killing him fast enough.) The sister of Commedus, Lucilla (who had actually been executed at the beginning of Commedus' reign) announces that we are all going to honor Maximus and restore the Republic.For a Roman history buff, this is like saying World War II was Hitler giving us all Ice Cream.What actually happened was that after Commedus (who wasn't that bad of a guy, really) Rome went into an embarrassing period known as the ""Year of the Five Emperors, where a decent man was assassinated, the office of emperor was auctioned off, and three rival generals launched a civil war.This is universally agreed to be the tipping point of Rome's inevitable decline.","

"NewDivide1701","22 November 2005","Probably one of the best movies I have ever seen.Every minute brings forth more intrigue to Gladiator. Non-stop action keeps the adrenaline pumping, the portrayal of the characters makes us see what the director and writer wants us to see, and a story that keeps us coming for more.Russell Crowe does an excellent job in his portrayal of Maximus, a man cut down from a general to a slave, and then became more powerful than the emperor, exactly as the tag-line says. His despair over the death of his family and the future he's denied, his disgust over the games, and his quest for vengeance when he finds the man who killed his family and his close friend.Joaquin Phoenix also does a marvelous job for Commodus. Successfully showing him as a spoiled rich boy lusting for more power, and viewing his as someone not to be feared, but pitied.Even though Oliver Reed died before he could shoot some very important scenes, they flawlessly brought him back from the dead digitally to say his final words, ""Shadows and Dust,"" from a test shoot earlier making the approach of the climax even more gripping.Alien, Blade Runner, and now Gladiator. What ever Ridley Scott does for these movies, he should keep it up and other directors should take notes.","

This is the time when you fight all your battles for yourself and your family. Like Maximus you will dream to get out of your Colosseum and break the chains.Third time - when you feel your life is close to an end - just to remember what you have achieved. Like the old emperor Marcus Aurelius you will have to realize if your name would be remembered or forgotten forever.

"mjneu59","22 November 2010","Ridley Scott's Oscar-winning ersatz epic is one of the least spectacular big-screen spectacles ever sold to an undemanding public: a sand-and-sandal throwback stripped of the genre's all too necessary guilty pleasures. The idea was to recreate for today's digital generation a wide-screen Roman Empire costume drama from Hollywood's pre-video adolescence, but all the fancy computer imagery (and state-of-the-art budget) only makes the new film look and sound more solemn and pompous than its beefcake role models. Worse yet, the occasional token nod toward old-fashioned visual grandeur isn't enough to camouflage the claustrophobic TV screen compositions and typically frantic Madison Avenue editing job (designed, perhaps, to hide the digital wrinkles).Russell Crowe is the title character: a Roman general fallen from imperial favor, battling for his life and honor on the floor of the Coliseum, where the prize for victory is another day of slavery and the cost of defeat is a mercifully quick death. Crowe's protagonist is a man of few words, most of them delivered in a flat monotone, matching the equally colorless photography, shaded in picturesque hues of misty gray and mud brown sepia.Don't expect any surprises from the strictly formula riches-to-rags-to-rebel hero scenario, which doesn't even allow the villains (degenerate emperor Joaquin Phoenix and his sister/lover Connie Nielson) a chance to have any fun. Audiences (and too many critics, who should have known better) conditioned by habit to reject anything original made the film a worldwide hit, but even in our current age of diminished expectations it should have been clear that they don't make 'em like they used to anymore.","

Ridley Scott's direction is choppy and forced. It reminded me more of one of his brother's movies. I love Russell Crowe but the fact that he won Best Actor for this and not for ""The Insider"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"" just doesn't make sense. To me he just seems bored in some scenes. I wonder if the Oscar voters watched any of the other films from that year because this sure wasn't better than ""Traffic"". Of the 2 and a half hours running time, there are really only 30-40 minutes of excitement. The rest is average at best and the ending is just ridiculous. THIS IS NOT A CLASSIC. ""Gladiator"" is a good film but does not deserve the praise that it is given by most on this site. I give it a 6 now but my opinion for this film drops every time I watch it.","

"smaniatopoulos","8 December 2023","The Gladiator came out in 2000. One year later it would be followed by the Fellowship of the Ring. One year earlier, the Matrix had changed the way we look at scifi. It was a great movie of the rather rare ""historic fantasy"" genre (although at the time it was mislabeled a ""sword and sandal epic"") which has produced a rather limited number of great movies.But the Gladiator, unlike most movies of this genre, remains one of the most beloved Hollywood epics.In hindsight, the reason is obvious: it has Russel Crowe, the greatest rising star of that generation in top form, a form which sadly did not last very long. It has the one and only Ridley Scott going full throttle for the first time since Alien, delivering a visual masterpiece with some of the most iconic scenes of the 21st century, such as the ""hand that caresses the wheat in the field"", a shot that has been copied countless times.It has a great story, which is offensively inaccurate from a historical standpoint but catches the spirit of the devoted hero that falls victim of unethical powers, is betrayed, destroyed but yet he rises up and fulfills his destiny.And of course it has Hans Zimmer, whose soundtrack has become one of the most well known musical themes of all time.The movies was flawed and flawless at the same time, equally grand and inaccurate, epic and engaging, sad and exhilarating. It was a kick ass movie that nailed it.And, maybe above all, it was the most successful movie of a golden era of cinema:
From 1995 to 2005, cinema changed forever: directors broke boundaries in virtually every genre, from scifi (the Matrix) and fantasy (LOTR) to comedy (the Big Lebowski), action (Kill Bill), and drama (Fight club).Hell, even Chinese cinema had joined that great wave of innovative and brave filmmaking with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.The studios could not believe their luck. Veterans, newcomers, new writers, new cinematographers, everyone was at the top of their game, making great movie after great movie.I do not know exactly when this phenomenon started, but it is my firm belief that it was pushed to the forefront by Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.We were reaching the end of the century, a new millenium was about to begin, and suddenly everyone was up for trying something new.Ridley Scott was not new, of course, but the great recognition of his art and the artistic value of Blade Runner had become generally acknowledged only a few years ago, and this realization may have contributed to giving him the chance for a new visual masterpiece, helmed by an Australian newcomer who had only played one big part as supporting actor in a film noir (LA Confidential).Ridley gave it his all, and the Gladiator remains, to this day, his most successful and highest rated movie.Sadly, the wave of innovation did not last as long as it could: it was gradually replaced by the unprecedented success of the superhero movie, which almost destroyed cinema, first by razing the box office and once all the good movies had been made, by trying to outsell competition disguised as a form of social platform for inclusion, diversity, equality, gender rights, and all sorts of activist ideas.20years later, no mainstream studio cares anymore about making art or telling great stories.It's all about making good PR in Hollywood regardless of talent or content.We are now reaching a quarter of a century from the last golden era of cinema.The superhero genre has finally reached its inevitable end. And finally, after almost two decades, an exceptional historical movie (Oppenheimer) and an original concept (Barbie) are in the top-5 grossing movies of the year, while almost half of the new superhero movies have flopped.Let's just hope that we are nearing a new age of cinema, one where the medium can be restored to its former glory.The Gladiator remains, to this day, one of the greatest timeless examples of how cinema can truly enthrall and inspire people, even those who do not necessarily believe in art.","

"marcin_kukuczka","18 June 2006","They were just shadows and dust. Yet, their courageous deeds have been admired for hundreds of years. Their name was ... gladiators.Since 1959 and the release of the ultra popular Roman epic BEN HUR, many people have thought that William Wyler's movie reached the ultimate splendor on screen and no other production may take its stead. However, the memorable year 2000 sees a premiere of GLADIATOR by Ridley Scott. The movie's title does not indicate any novel nor any specific period of Roman history. Yet, the film becomes one of the top Hollywood productions. What is so extraordinary about it that GLADIATOR is admired not only by epic fans but by the audiences of different interests, different preferences, different expectations from a movie.First of all, GLADIATOR, unlike many other epics, shows a very realistic image of the Roman Empire and makes a perfect use of this on screen. In this case, the movie which discusses a very distant period in time (2nd century A.D.) occurs to be clearly interpreted and understood by the 21 century-audience. This fact proves a great talent of the director, Ridley Scott, who exactly knows viewers' expectations. Such a movie is more a spectacle and entertainment than pure history. Therefore, even if there are historic figures in the film, we cannot treat it as history and look for historical accuracy or inaccuracy. It is much more since it generally shows Rome, its power, its emperors, its people, its games, finally...its gladiators.It seems quite unnecessary to present the content of the film while hundreds have done this before me. What I want to concentrate on GLADIATOR's universal aspect, which makes it an exceptional epic. As a matter of fact, no one will fully understand the story of Maximus (Russell Crowe) without profound reflections. Simply, the entire content of GLADIATOR is one great symbol. A simple man, a farmer becomes a great leader, emperor's friend. Yet, when times change, he gets through a personal tragedy becoming a slave, a gladiator whose primary task is to amuse people and the corrupted emperor by killing. Nevertheless, it is him who is honored at his death - He was the one who loved Rome. In my opinion, the very first shot of the movie shows it all - where Maximus heart is - a bird symbolizing gentleness, and fields symbolizing his life. The final fight on arena between emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and Maximus cannot be treated historically. It is a symbolic battle between two visions of Rome (using modern language - between two visions of the world) - the one of honor, equality and love and the one of decadence, slavery and corruption. And this is, I think, the most important message of this movie. In this perspective, the movie develops all characters universally.CAST: Russell Crowe, who portrays Maximus, does a very fine job. He portrays a man of a good heart who is exposed to living in the reality that is against all he heads for, a leader who got a new name, ""gladiator"". I loved his performance in one scene more than in any other - in the conversation with the emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Wonderful meeting of two seeing one goal - goodness of Rome! Joaquin Phoenix is also very memorable as brute Commodus, a corrupted emperor who is, on the one hand, a blood sucker, but, on the other hand, a man who wants to be loved. I also loved the performance of Connie Nielsen as Lucilla. This beautiful Danish actress very well fits to this role portraying a woman who lives in the very ambiguous reality. A note must also be made of Derek Jacobi, unforgettable Claudius from a perfect BBC series made almost 30 years earlier. Yet, two performances by already late actors are a must to mention, Richard Harris's phenomenal portrayal of Marcus Aurelius and Oliver Reed's slave trader Proximo. Oliver Reed died during filming and his death is a terrible loss to all film industry. We thank him for such a powerful performance in this film, unforgettable, forever in our hearts and minds.Some people say that GLADIATOR is too violent. I admit that there are very brutal moments, especially the ones showing arena fights. Nevertheless, that is what these fights looked like. Visual effects of the movie are so stunning that I was lost in admiration. Commodus's triumphant entrance to Rome (a bit exaggerated in size but representing not that much a city but rather its power), the sequence at Zucchabar, a fictional Roman province set in Mauretania Caesariensis, the imperial palace, the brutal battle in the woods of Germania - all is filled with unforgettable grandeur! The locations at Morocco, Malta, Italy and Spain add a thrill to the spectacle.And the music... it is half of the whole entertainment to watch GLADIATOR without the admiration of its excellent musical pieces. It is a flow from sentimentalism, through exotic sounds to the tunes expressing the gore of the arena. I loved the title song, it touched my heart. There is something like a gentle power in it...GLADIATOR is in many aspects a film that will become a cult movie, not only an ancient epic but a masterpiece of movie art. When I was a boy, I was saddened by the fact that I don't live in such times like the 1950s when great masterpieces were released like BEN HUR, QUO VADIS or THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. Yet, GLADIATOR made my dream come true. We all do live in such times, the times of great movies and this is, without doubt, one of such films. 10/10! They were just shadows and dust. However, who among them would predict that they would once (in almost 2000 years) be the characters of such a film masterpiece. So were only the emperors immortal?","

"cxw1065","18 May 2000","I am usually worried that I'm in for a big let-down when I am looking forward to a film as much as I was to this one.  This time however, I was very pleasantly suprised, when Gladiator not only fulfilled but surpassed my expectations.  It's a brilliant film, which (while containing weaknesses such as a script which wasn't quite as good as it could have been, and one climactic scene which completely changes, and ruins, the ending) manages to engage your heart and mind.The performances are without exception excellent (although the accents may distract a bit, there is such a wide variety of them).  I must single out for commendation Mr. Phoenix, who despite his youth manages to portray a character with such conviction that you never for a moment doubt his interpretation.  His physical performance is as good as his mental one.The film rests firmly on the (extremely attractive and capable) shoulders of one Russell Crowe.  In a tour-de-force performance, he manages to convey a man (not a superhuman) with frailties and doubts and fears and heart.  I cannot convey to you how brilliant this man's performance was.  If anyone else had been this character, the film would have rated at best a five out of ten.Kudos to Russell Crowe, and to Ridley Scott, for managing to keep this film on a level with humanity, rather than one in which the characters become killing machines.A must see, five stars out of five.","

"cjswan","16 May 2000","Germania, 150 AD, the setting of Gladiator's opening scene. Far from the blazing sun and dazzlingly beauty of ancient Rome, Ridley Scott shoots the opening sequence in a subdued light. The Roman legions are nonetheless impeccably turned out as they face the comparatively disorganised rabble that inhabits this miserable environment. Caesar's soldiers seem somewhat misplaced here. However, Russell Crowe is at home in this environment of knee-deep mud and merciless snow. He commands the screen with all the virtues of his motto: Strength and Honour.'The plot, with its hero-to-zero-to-hero nature, runs through Gladiator's every vein. As General Maximus, Russell Crowe is welcomed by Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Richard Harris) to take the Roman throne as Emperor of a new Republic. All does not run smoothly however as mislead heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) takes over Rome with ill-gotten domination, having dispatched his own Father. Maximus is cast out to find his family murdered and his Spanish farm burnt to the ground. Taken in as a slave by Proximo (Reed), Maximus becomes a Gladiator and starts his journey to the Coliseum and revenge against Commodus.Scott's cast is powerful and he is not left wanting as powerful performances are delivered by all. Due to his untimely mid-production death, Oliver Reed is created in some scenes by the grace of computer graphics, which are as convincing as they come; sometimes making it difficult to differentiate between Reed himself and his computerised counterpart.
It is, however, the supporting actors who create many of Gladiator's best dialogue-based scenes. In an accomplished demonstration of her acting ability as Lucilla, Connie Nielsen saves the occasional scene as Joaquim Phoenix shows us that he can do evil', but is less convincing when it comes to the more emotional qualities of his role.As a vehicle for the plot, Scott's beautifully created and highly symbolic (there is an image of fire in nearly every shot of the film) dialogue scenes are of a certain merit with digitally created backgrounds that encompass the meticulous nature of the Roman Empire. However, dialogue alone does not an epic movie make, and it is in the film's spectacular action sequences that Gladiator come into its own. Shot on location in Malta, Scott's first arena was built by an army of locals and commanded some 5000 extras (a large majority of whom were of a cardboard variety). All of this pales in comparison as we arrive in a digitally created Rome which makes some scenes in Ben Hur some somewhat small scale. The Coliseum is immense, both inside and out, and the computerised provides the electric atmosphere in which Crowe and his feline companions (four sizeable, and real, Bengal tigers) perform.The battle sequences are perfectly choreographed and shot as iconic masks and typically Roman chariots are abundant in their power and imagery. As swords clash and heads roll, Ridley Scott is triumphant in the application of special effects technology and his directorial prowess.Always one to embrace technology, Scott's views over Rome's landscape are reminiscent of the beautifully created cityscape of Blade Runner. This is a film that fears so little and boasts so much, even a lady archer being sliced clean in half by a spiked chariot wheel!All those involved with Gladiator should be delighted and confident with their creation, for indeed this is a convincing and enthralling display with epic proportions to take the wind from James Cameron's titanic sails.","

"BA_Harrison","27 April 2018","In the event of his death, ageing Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) intends to leave his trusted Hispano-Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe) in charge of Rome, instead of allowing his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) to become his successor. Commodus has other ideas: he murders his father and orders Maximus to be executed. Maximus, not one to give up quietly, makes a daring escape, and, badly wounded, heads for home, where he discovers that his wife and son have been crucified on Commodus' orders. Passing out from the pain of his injury, Maximus is captured by slavers, nursed back to health and forced to fight as a gladiator. This new life eventually leads him to the Colosseum of Rome, where he finally comes face to face with the man who betrayed him.From director Ridley Scott, Gladiator is a historical epic to rival the classics from the 'golden age' of Hollywood. Opening in 180 A.D., with a brilliantly orchestrated battle between the Roman armies and the tribes of Germania, Scott's film grabs the viewer's full attention from the outset and doesn't let go until the end, having delivered an Oscar-winning central performance from Crowe, a memorable score by Hans Zimmer, excellent supporting roles from the likes of Harris, Phoenix, Connie Nielsen and Oliver Reed, and some of the most impressively bloody scenes of hand to hand combat ever filmed.If I were to choose my favourite scene, it would be the 're-enactment' of the battle of Carthage, a savage piece of action cinema in which Maximus and his fellow gladiators are ushered into the arena like cattle to the slaughter, only to turn the tables on their attackers, winning the hearts of the Roman masses in the process. A rousing, blood drenched spectacle, it's a fine example of Scott's expert direction, a masterclass in camera placement and movement, editing (the violence is extreme, but the film doesn't wallow in the gore), sound design and special effects, which still thrills even after all of these years.","

"alice liddell","16 May 2000","There is a lovely film in here about a spoilt brat teenager who unfortunately has tyrannical rule over the Roman Empire.  So whereas most sulky boys kick tables and storm off to their room, Commodus Caesar gets to throw those who annoy and humiliate him to digitally enhanced cats. Joaquin Phoenix gives a magnificent performance, camp in the best swords and sandals tradition, throwing childish fits when he doesn't get his way, sporting marvellously gothic eyeliner (Romans vs Goths, you see), scheming elaborate punishments for his big sister, which, for him, unlike the rest of us, who get our hair pulled, can actually, horribly, be realised.It's also nice to see that the hackneyed tide of postmodernism has been stemmed Canute-like, and a complex period in Roman history, with its plagues, revolts, tyrannies and back-room intrigues and murders can be 'crystallised' in a young boy's feeling unloved by his father.  Haven't we all felt this melancholy burden at one time or another, the failure to do what is right, honourable and Stoic, when ambition and privilege seem much more immediately rewarding?Add to this the accursed, tragic flaws of incest and worse (the difference between mad tyrant and noble hero must always be expressed in terms of neurotic sexuality and fertility-turned-ascetic renunciation), and you have a truly harassed, 'modern' hero, well supported by a ripe mixture of theatrical greats (Derek Jacobi) and former 60s icons (Oliver Reed, David Hemmings - is this Scott's THE LIMEY?).  He gets to watch some champion gladiating too.Of course, a film of this stature, size and scope must inevitably have its longueurs, here an elaborate sub-plot involving Russell Crowe, an inexorable melange of MAD MAX/BRAVEHEART (noble hero turned insane revenger after wife and family slaughtered; the bleak landscapes witnessing vastly scaled pub brawls; the lengthy, dimly lit, self-agonising indoor scenes, as a 'man' debates within himself his 'man'liness and duty; the loaded dichotomy between caricatured, vicious Imperials and unswervingly decent warrior; buddy-buddy development; Godardian, alienating, swelling score) and SPARTACUS (the violent gladiator scenes; the chinned sincerity; the captive peasant taking on the might of the Roman Empire; the structural homophobia).Crowe is a revelation - and reveals a hitherto unmined talent for comedy and parody.  Of course, this works because, like Leslie Nielsen, he marshalls a tautly disciplined straight face, but his clenched surliness, his Heston-like intergrity, his attempt to absorb the Stoic precepts of Marcus Aurelius (his scenes with Richard Harris are worthy of that masterpiece oof classical epics, CARRY ON CLEO), his reciting dialogue Abrahams-Zucker-Abrahams would have been proud to have written, are so funny (the scene where he rises off the ground of the auditorium to 'meet' his family is pure comic genius), so expertly pomposity-bursting, so winding up the pretensions of an entire genre, I emerged from the film with great respect for this stunningly versatile, deceptive actor.He couldn't have done it, though, without the help of Ridley Scott, essaying another mass culture in decline, who has bravely exorcised the complexities, ambiguities and enigmas of BLADE RUNNER to create an admirably simplistic epic, to abandon the weight of historical validity in favour of Boys' Own fantasy.  It would have been easy with this budget to create a teeming, living, authentic Rome, but Scott the postmodernist recognises the impossibility of this project, and, in an act of avant-garde innovation, hangs his drama on a handful of geometric signifiers, with little relation to any reality beyond the drawing board.There has been an extraordinary , and for me higly promising, strain in modern Hollywood filmmaking (eg TITANIC, THE PHANTOM MENACE), in which the new digital technology is not used to create novel, vast, convincing, strange worlds, but to elucidate the principles of Brechtian epic theatre, to foreground artificiality, implausibility, soullessness, encouraging the audience out of the narrative, to stand back and reflect on issues such as the construction of history, mass spectacle etc.  The dreams of the New Wave may finally have come to fruition.Like most films of this type, GLADIATOR is about a hero who is too good for his society, who cannot live in it.  But is he?  The absence of historical verity in the story set me thinking to about what Scott was trying to say. Because the film is a story about a man who lets his family die, who isn't there for them.  This is a curious hero to celebrate, though appropriate in an age where fathers often abandon their families, even to the extent of not paying alimony.  After Maximus (Scott must have been a Monty Python fan) sees the charred crucified bodies, the film goes momentarily into dream mode.  But does it ever come out of it?  This is a story that is full of doubles, strange correspondances, mirror scenes; it thoroughly interrogates the nature of family, and finally reaches a ritual climax in which both sides of the same coin (sons) wipe each other out, like Gothic doppelgangers.  Is the whole film Maximus's guilty dream, about guilt, emasculation, eternal torture over failure, the descent into bestiality? Is it a theme of America's guilt over slavery and subsequent race traumas, or a renunciation of them (both whites and blacks are slaves here).  Whatever. This is the first great comedy of the millennium.","

"viggodahlin","9 August 2021","There is no denying it. Phoenix in all of his movies he delivers. He commits perfectly to the role he plays and in playing the character Commudus he truly shows, that it doesn't matter if he's the villain or the hero.The story in this film is quite dark if you think about it. The greatest general of Rome, Maximus continues to obliterate the enemy in his scope with extreme audacity. Although, later on we are introduced to his displeasure battling in the war and his longing to his family at home. The Caesar tells Maximus that he wants him to take over as the new Caesar after he dies. Maximus does not want the throne and so on he refuses to accept the honorful request from the Caesar.As soon as Caesar tells Commudus that instead of him, the true Caesar, Caesar wants Maximus to take the throne, it all goes to hell. Maximus gets the worst punishment possible (his family gets burned alive and he has to submit to being a slave). And after all this he still manages to rise in the ranks and ultimately overthrow the throne from winning the crowd and killing Commodus.But it wasn't this simple of a story for me, at least for the character Commodus. Commodus, he's envious, greedy, sad and a very lonely soul. From the very start we see how his own father completely and utterly humiliate him in front of the whole soldier army, and indirectly chooses the general as a ""better"" son. But he keeps his head up, he knows that he will still be the next ruler of Rome and to marry his own sister. But this plan becomes a lot more difficult when his father comes to him to say that he will pick the general as the next Caesar and not him, and that ""Your mistakes as a son, is only my mistakes as a father."" Hearing all this, he puts up a beautiful speech and then hugs his father to at last say, goodbye...Commodus kills his father and then later on picks himself to be the next Caesar as it wasn't official of his father's choice. Maximus's family dies and he gets hunted to be killed so no complications can arise. Everything works out as he wanted but nothing is what he dreamed of. The crowd of the colosseum and entire Rom boos him and want him gone. The senate isn't either to pleased about his arrival but of course one narcissistic guy enjoys his upcoming. Commodus is quickly tired of the senate and want him and his sister only to exist in this purified world. He caresses her often and eventually tries to kiss her but she in no way feels the same, she is terrified of him and hates him.Commodus doesn't care and forces her to be with him or he will kill her son. Later we see him watching the gladiator games and a particular someone getting extra attention. He goes down to see who it is and yes, it's Maximus. He tells Maximus to drop his weapon if i recall correctly, and after a short solid pause Maximus doesn't follow his orders, the CAESAR's orders. The crowd loves it and Commodus obviously can't kill Maximus in front of the crowd, then it would be impossible to get the crowd back. A little input from myself is that, this is where Commodus realizes that it truly does not matter which position he is in or Maximus for that matter, it all stays the same.After a few events unravel, Commodus faces Maximus in a 1v1 sword fight. Both lose their sword after a while but Commodus has a knife up his sleeve and tries to stab Maximus but the reverse happens and Commodus tries punching Maximus several times in his arms with nothing happening. Maximus ends it and Rome is saved.A very fine storytelling indeed. The reason as to why i focused much more on Commodus is because he is certainly more sympathetic and interesting. He truly never understood love or life in that matter. His goals were always deceitful, malevolent and greedy. He never received even an ounce of love in his entire life and all he ever wanted was for his father and for his sister to love him. He never deeply wanted anything more than that. It's heartbreaking and the acting that Phoenix applies to this intricate and lonely soul is absolutely astounding and just beautiful. My words can't merely express enough how great of an act Phoenix puts on.8.5/10.","

"TheKing2","9 January 2013","Not sure were to start. A great director a very fine cast. A pointless movie. It starts with again a PotC soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. I'm perfectly sure he can write an excellent score but he has been hiding that virtue for a very long time. I'm almost convinced that Mr. Ridley Scott let Mr. George Lucas take the honor's. The characters are quite as flat as they are on Star Wars 1 2 and 3. Even cinematography makes you squirm. Zoom in on a actor while he is monologuing? That hasn't been done since the 70ties and was dealt with there and than. Both Ben Hur and Spartacus were done over 40 years ago and were more convincing and better acted. Also watch Titus and be really stunned by acting soundtrack and story.skip it","

"Indy-52","4 June 2001","GLADIATOR is a fantastic achievement in modern filmmaking. I never expected to ever see another Roman epic, but Ridley Scott has proved it is possible. What's so great about this movie is that it has a really entertaining and enthralling storyline, not just special effects and action (although it has a lot of that): it knows how to make us care about the people in it and how to develop a sense of style and elegance (thanks to director Ridley Scott). The movie is fueled by a number of powerhouse performances: Russell Crowe is perfect as the title character, I loved Oliver Reed as Proximo, and Joaquin Phoenix made a perfectly hissable villain. I was amazed at how exciting this movie was. Although the opening battle sequence is not very promising, with its confusing, chaotic editing, after that it's just uphill: the film will send you on roller-coaster ride of nonstop thrills. The effects are very well done: there is a scene where we see Commodus arrive at Rome as the new emperor that's absolutely breathtaking. I also loved the way they recreated the Colosseum. Parts of this movie are truly awe-ispiring. The fights in the arenas are spectacularly sensational. I must also mention John Mathieson's absolutely beautiful cinematography and Hans Zimmer's perfect music score. Some scenes where Mathieson's visuals and Zimmer's music mix are undescribably beautiful and breathtaking. The entire film is beautiful: just about any frame of it would make a really good poster to stick on the wall. I recommend this film to those who appreciate to finest things in life.","

"Flagrant-Baronessa","26 August 2006","""They tell me your son squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross. And your wife moaned like a whore when they ravaged her again and again... and again.""Gladiator is an amazing story of revenge. It is a story of one man's struggle to challenge the emperor of Rome, wearing nothing but slaves' attire, being sold as a gladiator for the people's morbid amusement, and seeking vengeance for having his family murdered through these 'games'. It is also a political story about justice in the midst of corruption, interwoven with swords, sandals and battlefields á la epic war saga. This, my friends, is a true underdog story with a hero so poignant that it is impossible not to be engrossed in his struggle.Whatever _I_ will say about this film will simply be semi-coherent, rambling praise as I like the works of Ridley Scott so much. However, far from everyone liked Gladiator (2000). Roger Ebert disliked it. Moviegoers criticized it for being unoriginal  a mild rip-off of Spartacus (1960) and the likes. It may have been warmly received by the Academy, but audiences were very divided when it was released. I'd like to think that I am usually able to see things from other people's perspective, but just this once, how could you not be entertained?So although I usually trust Roger Ebert a great deal, I have absolutely no idea what he was on about in panning the film for its gloomy tone and ""muddy, fuzzy and indistinct"" skies. Maybe he simply forgot to clean his widescreen TV, because the Gladiator I know sees hugely epic games under a brilliant blue sky in the coliseum, a glorious tournament that is so entertaining because of its flair. The final battle has ROSES RAINING FROM THE SKY! It does not get more vivid or colourful than that.These battle-scenes of Gladiator are, of course, extremely well tended to by Ridley Scott who is the master at crafting epic war scenarios (see, I told you fanboy-praise would sneak its way in!). The patient, slow pacing of the film seems to take a sudden halt here, and then fast-forward in an amazingly rapid-fire pace with quick shots, swinging swords, vivid skies and a great score by Hans Zimmer to further emphasize the dramatic mood. The very culmination of this is not at the end, but rather early. It is the moment that Maximus (a superb Russell Crowe) removes his helmet, reveals his identity and faces the emperor, after a long and ferocious battle. It is a scene so poignant that I always wish it would have been saved until later on in the film, thereby giving it even more weight. But no matter, because rest assured that it is goosebumps-inducing enough.A gloriously entertaining, heartfelt and carefully crafted war adventure by Ridley Scott in which little feels missing or incomplete. What more could you ask for? Great acting from the cast, I suppose  well, this is also present in Gladiator. Best of all, the actors have good dialogue to work with so they don't choke on the dated lines. Russell Crowe propels this film with his heroic personality, Connie Nielsen adds introspective depth, and Joaquin Phoenix is excellent as the twisted but idealist emperor Commodurus. 9/10","

"kevin142","20 October 2005","The old Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius wanted to give the power to his favorite general Maximus. Due to envy, Commodus killed his father Marcus and claimed him as the lawful successor. The misfortune fell on Maximus. After he lost his family, he did not want to live anymore. However life did not go on as he wanted. He was trained as a gladiator. It mattered life and death. If you wanted to survive, you had to kill the opponent.The final duel between Maximus and Commodus was the most soul-stirring duel I ever watched. Although Maximus was a powerful general, he was a kind and generous person. It was his kindness that made him become the victim of insidious Commodus. Maybe he was just fit for leading an army.Russell Crowe convincingly played the brave general Maximus. He was deserved to win the best actor (the academy award). It was a pity that Ridley Scott did not win the best director.A movie that can push you forward. 9/10","

"Gordon-38","21 June 2000","I absolutely love Ridley Scott.  ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" both rank among my favorite films.  ""Gladiator,"" though, just didn't work for me.Russell Crowe is a fantastic actor, and really ought to be a big, big, big star.  Unfortunately, he's not given much to do here.  He fights, he broods, he whines...but he's never really forced to stretch his talents.My main quibble, I suppose, is that the movie was clearly going for ""Braveheart"" effect, and it fails.  It was easy to get some sympathy going for Mel Gibson's character in ""Braveheart.""  He was fighting for freedom and justice.  Sadly for ""Gladiator,"" it's pretty hard to develop much sympathy for any particular faction within the Roman empire.  Where ""Braveheart"" was able to give us a few effective hallucinations and dream sequences, ""Gladiator"" shoves it down our throat with oddly-colored, tripping-on-acid dream sequences every five minutes.  Yes, we get the point.  He misses his family, and he'll see them in the afterlife.  Move on already!Apart from the dream sequences, the movie does look pretty spectacular.  The Colliseum is an impressive sight.  The costumes, for once in a sword-and-sandal epic, don't look like the costume department simply raided the bedding department at K-Mart.  And the fight scenes are, indeed, entertaining and visceral.In the end, though, the movie is less than the sum of its parts.","

Gladiator, I can just sit there and watch it, because if you miss a part, you won't get it. The end was great, i really liked it. It was the best fight scene at the end.

"bluzman","25 February 2001","Gladiator is well-made and sports all the frills of a big budget production -- big sets and lotsa extras in good costumery.  However, let's be blunt, it is a 10-minute plot stretched out to epic proportions.  And, it is not a new plot.  It is not much more than a combination of Braveheart and Last of the Mohicans, go to Rome -- to name a couple of more recent films. In effect, it is hero gets done wrong and his loved ones are killed, so he bides his time and gets his revenge. I think all of the hurrah behind this film is from Hollywood having little else to offer this year at the Oscars (how else could Chocolat get nominated --$$$). Since Crouching Tiger is not part of the good ole boy Hollywood network, Hollywood is working hard to prevent a foreign film from upstaging them. In a different year, this film would not get half the recognition it is getting.","

"mahen1","10 March 2005","Poignant and evocative as this movie is, no way should it have been best picture. The story is too thin, the script lacks sufficient sophistication. Marcus Aurelius to Maximus'give Rome back to the people it belongs'. Way too vague and general a statement the like of which is repeated too often.Mind you this is a good film, powered by Crowe and the fabulous music of Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer. Gerrard's voice in the dream sequences is fantastic. Crowe has great presence. His Maximus is tired of fighting even before the fighting begins at the beginning of the film. The look on his face at the beginning says it all - a man duty bound to his orders, yet tired and sad at the nature of his duty, yet confident in his own ability and that of his soldiers to carry them out. Crowe retains his tortured tough guy look right the way through.As impressive as the action sequences are at the beginning in the German forest and later in the colosseum, the film looks way too grainy. It's alright for the early sequences where the forest is supposed to be dark and gloomy anyway, but Rome should have been more light and clarity. Special effects and art direction in this sense are a let down.The supporting cast is not given much to work with by the weak script. Derek Jacobi has almost nothing to do, Joaquin Phoenix's villain is just way too one dimensional (not really the actor's fault). Connie Nielsen easily stands out as Maximus' ex-love.I think it's the powerful emotions aroused by the Gerrard-Zimmer music and Crowe's screen presence which propelled this to best picture status. The story and script are just too weak to merit it. Ridley Scott doesn't make bad films, but the visual weaknesses of the film in parts prevent him being praised too much for this effort. He has enough good films under his belt anyway.","

"movieandtvfanatic","14 March 2010","Some movies manage to split the public and critics' opinions right down the middle but still manage to do well at the box office and get tons of awards notice and high ratings. ""Gladiator"" is one of the biggest examples of this, and I am in the camp that finds this to be a weak film.2000 was fairly weak year for movies, but this isn't an excuse for ""Gladiator"" winning the Best Picture Oscar. You still had great films that were completely snubbed like ""Almost Famous"" (my choice), Billy Elliot, Cast Away, Wonder Boys, and among the nominees, Traffic. These films represented the few glimmering moments of film in 2000.Gladiator has actually grown on me with repeated viewings but it is still by no means a great or even good movie. I feel that Russell Crowe did not deserve the Oscar over his entire category and while I am not a huge fan of him as an actor or from what his persona perceives, he did give good performances in ""L.A.

"jackjack-2","3 June 2001","Many critics blasted this film yet Hollywood fell in love it. Because of the critics I did not watch it until it was shown on HBO. I was appalled with its historical inaccuracy.Basically, Russell Crowe plays the role of a General in the Roman Army under the Roman Emperor Ceaser Marcus Aurelius, who many historians consider as one of the greatest Roman emperors. Marcus died while in Germany in 180 AD. His son, Commodus became the full emperor and made peace with the Germans.
It is at this point that the movie departs from history. In the movie, just befor Marcus Aurelius died he was going to appoint his successor. The fact is that he appointed Commodus co-emperor in 177 AD, three years before he died.The movie makes the point that Marcus Aurelius had no confidence that his son was suitable to be emperor. That much is true and the movie asserts that he tried to appoint someone else to succeed him. That is untrue. If he considered Commodus unfit to rule, why did he make him co-ruler? Because if he hadn't, under Roman custom, his son had to die if he was not made the successor.The story gets more bizarre as it goes on. Russell Crowe escapes execution by Commodus and his family is slain by Commodus, who does not know that Crowe is not dead. As cruel as Commodus is, it is unlikely he would have killed the family of Crowe. It would have served no purpose. In the process Crowe becomes a slave gladiator and winds up in Rome fighting as a gladiator before Commodus. So highly unlikely.I won't give you the ending but it is pure fiction. However, I will tell you what really happened. In 182 Commodus' sister Lucilla conspired with a group of senators to assassinate him. The plot failed, and Commodus retaliated by executing a number of leading senators. Thereafter, his rule became increasingly arbitrary and vicious. In 186 he had his chief minister executed in order to appease the army; three years later he allowed the minister's successor to be killed by a rioting crowd. Political influence then passed to the emperor's mistress and two advisers.Meanwhile, Commodus was lapsing into insanity. He gave Rome a new name, Colonia Commodiana (Colony of Commodus), and imagined that he was the god Hercules, entering the arena to fight as a gladiator or to kill lions with bow and arrow. Finally, when Commodus announced that he would assume the consulship on Jan. 1, 193, dressed as a gladiator, the public became incensed. On Dec. 31, 192, his advisers had him strangled by a champion wrestler.","

"inspectors71","7 December 2005","And Ridley Scott ain't Stanley Kubrick! Scott's sort-of remake of the modestly brilliant and richly emotional Spartacus and the horrendously bad Fall of the Roman Empire is a visually breathtaking epic that has almost no soul. I can't think of a reason to watch this movie other than to be entertained by three hours of close up violence, dazzling computer graphics, Russell Crowe's manliness, Connie Nielsen's loveliness, and Joaquim Phoenix's pree-versions.Done with the movie? You've got nothing to show for it.I don't worry too much about the myriad historical inaccuracies, such as the Roman Republic being reestablished at the end of Gladiator or Marcus Aurelius being murdered (if you have a clue about Roman history, you've just got to grin and bear it), but it's the reliance on the razzle-dazzle of the computer over the emotional depth of the characters that wears Gladiator down and leaves it bleeding in the center of the arena. The opening battle in Germany is eye-popping (and stomach-turning) in its recreation of a fight between Crowe's legion and a pack of Teutonic mouth-breathers. You're supposed to be impressed and hooked, but then the internecine backstabbing, betraying, and incestuous hanky-pankying start and you're left waiting for the next trip into some North African arena where you can watch people get disemboweled in the same grainy fashion as in Saving Private Ryan.It's all very appealing at a lizard-at-the-bottom-of-the-brain pan level (When I saw Gladiator in a theater in Ontario, Oregon, I heard a kid complaining, ""When are we gonna see her (Nielsen) naked?""). Front-load the gore and the kink, dazzle the viewer with recreations of the Roman world, and you don't need to get past Russell Crowe's growling and Phoenix's fussy sickness.Gladiator is emotionally empty. Stick with Kubrick's slave revolt.","

"repulsion","17 December 2000","The denizens of the Roman Empire were a particularly bloodthirsty lot, and apparently not that far off in mentality from our own culture. The vox populi, bored to the heavens with the multitudinous burdens inflicted on them by their government, seek escape in the mind-numbingly bland entertainment provided within the Colosseum. Gladiators fend for their lives against a series of uniquely dressed foes and beasts, all in the hope of winning their freedom. Everything about this testosterone-toned epic is meant to cater to a population who likes their filmed landscapes served to them WWF-style.Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a top army general in the army of Marcus Auerlius (Richard Harris), a dying patriarch who (in predictable fashion) unwittingly causes trouble within the family ranks by offering his throne to Maximus instead of to his son Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix). Auerlius' son is the kind of whinny, pussy-whipped boy that your audience likes to hate because the character's moral fiber makes the character so easily expendable. Commodus' temper tantrums lead to patricide and the film turns into an interminably messy three-hour affair simply centering on the standard theme of revenge.Maximus is sent to die in the woods but manages to get the upper hand and kill Commodus' henchmen. He returns to his homestead only to find his wife and son lynched from trees. Poor Maximus is denied the throne of Rome and is now being fueled to wage a one-man war against the sissy who wiped away his entire family. As Maximus works his way back to Rome, unbeknownst to the new king Commodus, our foppish king swishes around the kingdom ridiculously hitting on his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielson) and hovering inappropriately over his nephew Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark).In the first hour Ridley Scott has expertly painted his archetypal figures, forcing us to love the brave Maximus, wifeless and sonless, and hate the creepy teenager with the thirst for forbidden fruit. Maximus, once back in Rome, manages to enter a gladiator troop manned by one Proximo, the late Oliver Reed. This little group of circus freaks will provide Maximus with the proper cover through which he can maneuver himself into the hearts of Rome's people. Not only is the man driven by revenge but he is also cocky enough to believe that he has what it takes to accomplish the sort of feats no other gladiator has been able to accomplish. By his side is Juba (Djimon Hounsou), the proverbial Black voice of wisdom. If not for Will Smith's more unfortunately stereotypical role in Legend of Bagger Vance, this would have been the kind of role that would have garnered the deserved scorn of people like Spike Lee.For two hours, Scott inundates us with endless arena fireworks that would serve the acrobatics of the Rock and Hulk Hogan to a much better effect. The characterization of Crowe's character amounts to nothing more than a cocksure man, full of false bravado, whose only apparent skill is to raise his arm into the air and scream for his men to surge into battle. He is the kind of screen character who wages war against hundreds of foes within the course of a movie and manages to dispose of all of them with relative ease. He is also the kind of superhero archetype that garners the admiration of young boys like Lucius, something which causes our dear Commodus to go even further over the edge.Scott is to be admired in the end for at least not being a hypocrite, as he practices what he preaches. Since the citizens of Rome seem only to live for bloodlust, Scott manages to paint Gladiator as nothing else than that: entertainment geared for audiences whose sole interest is seeing men and tigers beat the s**t out of each other for three hours. But if this is all there was to the film then one would see little complaints from my person but Scott makes the mistake of filling his film with arty flourishes.The film opens with Maximus walking across a field, his hands slowly caressing tall blades of grass. These flashbacks, along with various cutaways to fast-moving skyscapes, amount to nothing more than pretentious attempts to add artistic credibility to an otherwise sophomoric film. Its as if he is aware of the fact that his film is devoid of any three-dimensional resonance that he tries to quickly interject soft touches of humanity into the proceedings. The end result is nothing less than visual illiteracy, ringing completely false and cowardly.When it comes to epics none come better than Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev or Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, two masterworks from Russia's greatest directors that fully captured the three-dimensional scope of war. The bad guys in these films, unlike the one played by Phoenix in Gladiator, are the kinds of foes whose selfishly malicious journeys are never cartoonishly drawn. The landscapes created by the Russian masters were poetic and grand, full of visual and emotional urgency. Scott's film is amounts to nothing more than being beat over the head by a club for three hours.","

"Bob A-2","27 August 2000","Finally saw Gladiator. Now that's guilty pleasure. Definitely a guy movie, as men outnumbered women three to one in audience. Star Wars, popular as it was, made the mistake of actually being about something; I'm happy to say that Gladiator has no redeeming value whatever. Just blood, mud and crud. Some of the killing made me laugh out loud, like when Crowe stabbed a guy with two swords and then chopped off his head while he was still standing. When Oliver Reed went into that monologue, accompanied by full orchestra, about the thrill of the cheering crowd I almost thought he was going to sing There's No Business Like Show Business. You know something is a bit over the top when one of the most restrained performances comes from Richard Harris! Another big laugh was when Crowe and Djimon win the crowd over by becoming the first ""tag team"" gladiators in pre-television history. Film pictures all the gladiators as united against some unnamed enemy over on the other side of the arena, thus daintily skirting the more Spartacus-like reality that the gladiators fought and killed each other -- and therefore, presumably, were hard put to have indulged themselves in the kind of emotional ties we see here. When the leading lady (Connie Nielsen, in fact just about the only woman) arranges to meet Crowe privately, she explains for the audience's sake that patrician women purchased sexual favors this way all the time. Seems to me everybody onscreen would know that already! It's like in The Mikado where Yum Yum turns halfway toward the audience and says to Nanky Poo ""But darling, you forget: in Japan..."" except that in the latter case WS Gilbert meant it as a joke. The one thing that dampened the pace was long dialogue scenes between the battles, as if the movie were hunting desperately for some intellectual point that would justify its existence, not unlike the '63 Cleopatra in that way. Unnecessary in either case, serving only to protract the running time. Gladiator should be at least a half hour shorter than it is. Audience ate it up, though.A friend commented ""Gladiator will live on TNT and USA forever!"" but I think she underestimates basic cable: there will probably also be a series starring Lorenzo Lamas.","

"searchanddestroy-1","15 August 2023","As Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott rose during the seventies with two masterpieces: DUELLISTS and ALIEN. Spielberg, JAWS, DUEL, ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.... Both were then rather young to bring such jewels. Scott is ten years older than his ""opponent"" but both have in common to continue, after all those decades, to provide regularely other masterpieces, and both have made around 30-35 movies, and for both of them - again- NAPOLEON film for Scott and mini series for Spielberg are also in their calendar. So GLADIATOR is a milestone for the sword and sandal - peplum - genre. Because the last ones were the Italian - and some American - productions from the early sixties, and as far as I know, there were not since. It was a kind of films totally forgotten from the bulk of audiences; but not the die hard movie goers, of course. This movie is unique, awesome, outstanding and opened the way, a boulevard, to many others: TROY,300 being the most widely known. The new, young audiences then discovered what their elders loved when they - youngest - were not even born. Ridley Scott resurrected the sword and sandal film genre with this one. And many sequences - particularely the hand of Russel Crowe touching the wheat field, was taken in at least one hundred other films and even commercials. Scott came from commercials business, during the seventies. Maybe this explains that.","

"jiefengf","2 September 2020","A classic movie successfully portrays a set of intensive characters in a relatively simple plot. The macho and valiant hero Maximus played by Crowe a man worshiped by his people. The beautiful and resourceful Lucilla by Nielsen a loving mother and the true continuation of the spirit of her father. And the envious and serpentine Commodus by Phoenix. The delicious portrayal of these characters creates a classical but still rich dynamics that for me is the main dish of this movie.In addition to this classicality of the plot and the characters, I appreciate the slightly heavy stroke on Commodus. This leads us to explore the natural question of what this man of jealousy is thinking. It's a man who yearns for respect and love of his father and his sister, all of which the mighty general has taken away from him. He seeks no power or fortune, but the name, which the enslaved Maximus claims so easily. This extra colour on the character of Commodus is like the shadow of the painting. A minor change, a huge enhancement.The story is complete. As I am not very knowledgable about neither the history of Rome nor the book, for me, the plot is still able to create a noticeable and constant tension that keeps me intrigued till the end. The ending is actually a little surprising, as I expected a realistic ending of tragedy. This ending, while emotionally pleasing, is a bit cliche. But then, the revelation of such ending reminds me that the move is about a poetic story. I don't feel this clicheness deal much damage to my experience to it.The friends Maximus make when enslaved as gladiator are not completely great. I cannot make a clear point on it. But I feel some of the strokes on these characters are not aesthetic enough and their purpose seems too obvious. This breaks the fluency and the naturalness of the story development. These characters should not bear so much personal emotions with Maximus.All in all, a great entertainment. An epic with strong characters. A story simple and beautiful. Flaws are not unnoticeable, but forgivable.","

"Bob-45","26 June 2000","I wanted to like GLADIATOR, I really did.  My sister said it was a great movie, and I really wanted to please my sister.  But I can't, you see, because GLADIATOR is not a great movie.  In fact, GLADIATOR is not even a particularly good movie.GLADIATOR is ineptly directed by  Ridley Scott; no two ways about it.  What else can explain keeping scenes in which the otherwise competent Russell Crowe lets his Australian accent slip through?  What else Can explain allowing leading lady Connie Nielson sleepwalk through her performance for two thirds of the Movie?  What else can explain carefully crafting a subplot involving a German Shepherd dog, then abruptly dropping it?  The ineptitude goes on and on.  The lack of chemistry between Crowe and Nielson is bad enough without further undercutting it with obtrusive, inappropriate music in early key scenes.  High- and low-key cinematography is intermixed without any concern for dramatic appropriateness.  It is almost as though Scott said, `Cloudy day? No problem, the audience won't notice.'  And lets talk about this cinematography.  Many of the low-key interiors with Joaqin Phoenix and Connie Nielson are so poorly lit, you cannot see Phoenix's eyes!  Poor Phoenix, probably the least experienced of the leads, has the toughest role.  Despite what you may hear, Phoenix does pretty well, despite Scott's undercutting.  ACTION FANS BE WARNED. Scott shoots ALL the action scenes without benefit of long shot (for perspective) and with computer generated and slow-motion action.  Think widescreen movie being shown in television (3:4) format.  Expect to be more confused than entertained.There IS plenty to like in GLADIATOR.  The late Oliver Reed as the gladiator owner is magnificent.  Richard Harris is very good as Marcus Aurelius. Djimon Hounsu, Derek Jacobi, David Schofield, Sven Ole-Thorsen and, especially,  Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) are all fine in supporting roles. Savor them if you must see GLADIATOR.","

"paulclaassen","2 February 2021","'Gladiator' is a spectacle of note and a film everyone should see at least once. Jealousy, ambition, greed, betrayal, loyalty, and vengeance are all so well illustrated here. It is an excellent script and very well executed.Russell Crowe is good as Maximus, a man who lost everything in the blink of an eye. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the antagonist, Commodus. Commodus is the epitome of a true villain. You will hate him. The film features all round good performances from a seasoned cast.Despite the film's long running time, it is never boring. From the impressive opening battle scene to the climatic finale, it is action and intrigue all the way. However, due to the film's theme, there's a lot of bloody and violent killings, hence the film can be grim and depressing at times.Ultimately, though, 'Gladiator' is a fantastic tale of vengeance. The photography is beautiful and the sweeping score is filled with so much emotion. Despite plenty of brutality, 'Gladiator' is still an absolutely beautiful film.","

"Prichards12345","3 April 2010","I have to admit I'm somewhat puzzled by the highly-marked reviews and Oscars dished out to this movie. I watched this on Blue-Ray for the first time yesterday, and my partner really enjoyed it - she'd give it two marks higher. Me, I found it occasionally good, overlong, treacle-paced, with a lot of one dimensional characters and stock situations. And a horrible, stupid ending.Gladiator follows the exploits of General Maximus (Russell Crowe), successful military commander, being betrayed by Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix), who usurps his Roman Emperor father Marcus Arelius (Richard Harris). Finding his family brutally murdered, Maximus is captured by slavers who sell him to a Gladiator school run by former Gladiator Proximo (Oliver Reed) And from here Maximus sees a chance to avenge the murder of his family.In truth the movie is rather far-fetched but with some stirring combat sequences. The opening battle in Germania is not particularly well-staged (Cavalry charge through a forest?) I have to admit I found the chief merit in the film to be the performances of some of the actors. Richard Harris and Oliver Reed are excellent, as is Joaquin Pheonix, who unfortunately appears to be acting in a different movie from everyone else. He gives a sensitive portrayal of a descent into madness (never once does he go over the top) but the film is really crying out for a black-hat villain, and is weakened overall by the character of Commodus. You feel the senate would usurp him easily, and the Roman political scenes are hopelessly inadequate in capturing the spirit of Rome.Russell Crowe is extremely dull and wooden in the part of Maximus, and I can only assume that Oscars are awarded largely on the strength of studio campaigns. Crowe himself has given much better performances. The music is also a very clichéd variation on Mars The Bringer Of War.So, if you don't expect too much you might like it. To me it's far from a great movie. Ridley Scott has made many better films.","

"ElMaruecan82","30 April 2017","In 2003, the American Film Institute presented the Top 100 Screen-Characters, fifty each in the hero and villain category, with the fiftieth spots belonging to the most recent characters: Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) from ""Training Day"" was the last bad guy and in the heroic department: General Maximum Decimus Meridius, Russel Crowe as the titular 'Gladiator'. His reputation outgrew ""Training Day"" and deservedly so, as the film not only resurrected the 'swords and sandals' genre but a new trend of spectacular entertainment that defined film-making of the new millennium.Like Jesus Christ in the Antiquity timing, there would be a before and an after ""Gladiator"" and like Caesar, one's got to give Ridley Scott the credit he deserves. He didn't use CGI for the sake of special effects but for storytelling, it was still the post-""Titanic"" era where CGI was used for the sinking, but the rest was made of flesh, props and bones, ""The Phantom Menace"" had CGI as vital as the actors, maybe more, but Scott used them to recreate the Coliseum, to make the cheerful crowds look real, to transport us into a universe that had deserted screens ever since the 60's: Antique Rome, as if its historical fall had spread to Hollywood. The use of CGI isn't perfect but it is the job of the story to distract your eyes and mind so that you won't try to spot the flaw, and speaking for myself, I was so enthralled by the story that I didn't even want to spot any flaw.Indeed, the real power of ""Gladiator"" is in the story, one of disconcerting simplicity, whose pitch could take indeed the time of an elevator ride but the treatment and the performances enrich it with a Shakespearian texture. You can say it's a story of an ambitious son who kills his father, Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) to prevent him from restoring the power to the people, but the performance of Joaquin Phoenix is of a dark, brooding and twisted man who can't stand the paternal rejection and surrenders to the reality of his own wickedness and commits the irreparable act. You can almost feel Commodus killing a part of himself with his father, the only shade of goodness left in his heart. If he can't rule because he's too amoral, so be it, and let's start a descent that will go as far as turning the victor of the Barbarians into a mortal enemy.Yes, I started with the villain, but it's the villain that gives its flavor to the film, and Commodus encompasses such a high degree of corruption that he inevitably highlights the straight morality of Maximus, his father's most faithful lieutenant, the son he wished he had. Oscar-winning Russell Crowe plays the general with enough depth and passion to be as believable as Mel Gibson when he played William Wallace (Gibson was the initial choice) but the real power of Crowe is to keep a low profile, never overplay the heroism figure, he's a man not guided by power or ambitions, freed from any corrupting torment, his only wish is to get back to his home near Trujillo. His moral 'cleanness' creates the perfect balance with a villain whose mind is clouded by hatred, Maximus seems ""one-dimensional"" because we relate to him as a good father and a good son while we're more captivated by the back-story of Commodus. The Emperor's last line ""your faults as a son are my failure as a father"" are the kind of lines Shakespeare might have been proud to write.There are elements of ""Julius Caesar"" and ""Spartacus"" but the resulting mix is unique and a standalone classic served by powerful performances, Connie Nielsen is the sister of Commodus and Maximus' previous mistress, and Oliver Reed makes his final performance as Proximo, the slave merchant and former gladiator who starts to respect Maximus as he realizes his value and encourages him to ""win the crowd"" as the only way to earn his freedom. Maximus couldn't care much about freedom, his only wish is to avenge his family and join them in the afterlife, a secret he shares with his fellow slave, a Numidian played by Djimon Hounsou. The films covers many layers from spectacular entertainment to its arousing story and while not being totally accurate, it is engaging in every department and captures the essence of movies as an art of storytelling and spectacle, using special effects, even to recreate a heart-pounding fight with a tiger, something meant not to be noticed.And all the special effects of the world wouldn't have a point if we didn't care for the characters in the first place.The film is known for having been severely bashed by Roger Ebert himself, I read his review and I got some of his points about the fuzzy and muddy look, and yes, there might have a few abuse of the bluish American light, but there's a scene that can summarize my feeling. When Maximus is encouraged by the crowd to kill one of the gladiator, he's popular already, he earns the respect of the crowd but when he spares the fighter, there's a hesitation, some of the audience boos but it then turns into cheers again as he's called ""Maximus the Merciful"".When you win the crowd, whatever you do will look good, I guess whatever Scott did could pass, his film, along with the Best Picture Oscar of the year, had won the crowd as well, and deserves a special nod as one of the most defining and influential movies of the 2000's. Or well, let's just say ""I was entertained"" to the point I didn't want to spot any visual flaw. That's how good it is.","

After a horrific battle to open the film, the Emperor is murdered by his power-hungry son, Commidus (Joaquin Phoenix) and Maximus is sentenced to die. After an amazing escape, Maximus returns home to find his family murdered and home destroyed. Next thing you know he's being sold as a slave to Proximo (Oliver Reed) a gladiator owner. The film is filled with amazing battle sequences held in the arena and a story of revenge that nearly matches Ben-Hur's (1959). Russell Crowe does an excellent job as the betrayed servant of Rome and the ability Joaquin Phoenix shows as a truly insane emperor is amazing. This film has some of the best acting I have ever seen. The film won (If memory serves me right) numerous awards and gratitude from critique's. The Colliseum is a tad to big compared to its actual size yet the director is still able to show how advance the Roman's were when it came to construction, battle tactics, and government. The look of Roman society is a bit off but it does not matter as that is not the focus of the film.Gladiator. Starring: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielson, and Oliver Reed. 5 out of 5 Stars.",NA
"athena24","19 August 2005","When I saw the movie in the theater for the first time I said it was OK. Not a great movie but worth seeing. Of course this is mainly for the battles that are amazing. And the score to the movie is fair enough. But I had a feeling that there is something wrong with this movie. It seemed that this is a replica of Braveheart. Only in Braveheart I got emotional without wanting it and in Gladiator I wanted to but I couldn't, It just wasn't so. The next time I saw it on DVD I noticed that each time I waited for the fights, because everything else is dumb. The plot unveils in turtle pace, the dialogs are over dramatic, it just like all the characters will burst with tears in minute after they say something. The most annoying thing is the plot itself. The characters look very unrealistic and unconvincing, a lot of time is wasted on unnecessary talk and the end can be predicted from the beginning.Well, a little bit of history for the end. There was an Emperor Marcus Aurelius that was considered as a ""good"" emperor, that ended the era of ""the five good emperors"". His son that succeeded him was Commodus ( just like in the movie ), but he's not killed his father. Marcus Aurelius died from a disease. Commodus himself was an excellent fighter. He fought with his father in the north, and after he became an emperor he tested himself each time in the coliseum arena with the gladiators and the beasts, and won each and every battle. Commodus killed by an athlete called Narcissus in his bath. Commodus considered himself a god and wanted people to think of him the same which can be viewed as insanity but for sure he wasn't weak and Coward as he was portrayed in the movie. He also ruled for 12 years, something that the movie doesn't count for.One commercial movie for Ridley Scott, but definitely one of the dumbest he made ( there is always G.I.Jane for this title ). Go see Alexander. Much closer to history, much better movie.",NA
"EdgarST","28 May 2001","In the 1960s, Steve Reeves would have killed John Drew Barrymore after 80 minutes (the necessary time to tell such an inane story), and ""The End"" (""Fine"" is more appropriate) would have appeared on the screen, as Reeves kissed Mylène Demongeot, Chelo Alonso or Scilla Gabel in the hereafter. The production would have cost 1/200 of the ""Gladiator"" budget, and you would have left the cinema feeling as silly and empty, but not as cheated, as after seeing this ""white elephant"". Unfortunately, this never-ending melodrama has been hailed as a masterpiece by the lovers of over-amplified sound effects, boringly fake visuals and gratuitous violence; and as in a Roman circus, it has been crowned with awards that make it look worst than it is. They all have shown more inspiration than the filmmakers in tracing a parallel between the Roman empire and the present one. What a shame.",NA
"Epaminondas","24 January 2005","Russell Crowe's fine performance as an ex-general turned into a slave and then a gladiator cannot save this picture from its utter absurdity, as the ending stages a pathetic duel between him and (no kidding) the Emperor of Rome in the Coliseum!!! There are some impressive scenes in the film, and Crowe has a beautiful screen presence; his friendship with a fellow Numidian gladiator is nicely conveyed, as is his attachment to amulets representing his family; the revelation of his identity is aptly charged with tension; and the preparation of the first battle is superb. Alas, it then turns into an orgy of gore.Being an ancient Greek (Theban to be precise) general, I'm bound to have qualms about this film's treatment of antiquity. As many reviewers have noted, the sole idea of a roman citizen (let alone a general) being turned into a slave is absurd, as is the trip from Germania to Spain during which Crowe seems to pass through some sort of rocky desert before entering the hills of Tuscany... How familiar is the filmmaker with the geography of Europe I wonder? Depictions of power relations in Rome are also quite laughable.But it is the voyeuristic stance and contemporary political relevance of the film which I find most disturbing. The despisal/fascination for the 'mob' which runs through the film has a distinctly fascist tinge. The violence is in some places unbearable, all the more so as it is gratuitous (the slaughter of Maximus' son)... My deep rejection and indeed contempt for the film really developed from listening to Ridley Scott's commentary on the DVD, in which he avows, among other depressing platitudes, that he would really have liked to live in Roman times, granted he was among the wealthy ruling classes... Probably in order to enjoy the spectacle of death and violence he in turn successfully inflicts on his twentieth-century teenage audience. The implications of such a fascination for slavery and violence are frightening, and make one want to watch SPARTACUS over and over again, as a reminder of the times in which Hollywood stood for humanist values, and not their despisal. It is also an opportunity to find where many seemingly novel ideas in GLADIATOR actually originate...All in all, despite how much we want to believe in Crowe, the film is far from the historical and psychological complexity (and visual clarity in battle scenes) of the much-underrated Alexander. Indeed, Crowe would have been perfect in the part, and would probably have had the guts to oppose to the wearing of Colin Farrell's ridiculous blonde wig!",NA
"marmar-69780","20 June 2020","Gladiator is with braveheart the biggest epic fantasy historical film ever made ,you can in that include some other films to like ben hur 59 version,but two mentioned above are in scale bigger then any other,this film may not to be historical accurate and i didnt want it to be,if i want to see that i would watch documentry,so it was good to see some changes and some more fantasy elements in it,russell crowe here give performance of lifetime and he was on top of his game back then,phoenix was also brilliant as a villain but little to weak and crybaby for my taste,connie nielsen may be with crowe the best part of film and she give a lot of femine power in it,gladiator is very gorgeous ,epic film with strong direction,great performances and beautiful score",NA
"SoumikBanerjee1996","12 April 2023","Since the film's first theatrical release, this has been bombarded by some ""experts"" accusing the creators of fabrications and falsifications of history. Those people have been pointing out and have been quite vocal about all the historical inaccuracies that are presnet in the writing.Now, I am neither a history buff nor do I deem myself knowledgeable enough to pass any sort of comments on this subject; however, I came here for my piece of entertainment, and I got plenty of it, and that is all that matters to me in the end.The movie has some incredible performances, a masterfully composed score, and a narrative that too seems to leave a lasting impact by the time it finally wishes to draw down the curtains. These things were more than enough to make me appreciate Mr. Scott's admirable attempts and I did adore what he had attained.",NA
"Reviews_of_the_Dead","22 August 2022","This is a movie that I originally saw in the theater with my mother and sister when it came out. I believe this would have put Russell Crowe on my radar along with Joaquin Phoenix. That first time seeing this, I loved it. It is one that I've seen since then, but it had been a while. Jaime and I watched this with her parents as well while we were visiting them. This is on our Internet Movie Database poster as well.We follow Maximus (Crowe) as they're fighting the barbarian tribes of Germania. The emperor is Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). He is fond of Maximus and much of this is the time that has been spent on the battlefield. Maximus is a great general. They score a victory and this brings Marcus' children to celebrate, Lucilla (Connie Nielson) and Commodus (Phoenix). Marcus scolds his son and this enrages him, causing him to kill the emperor. Without the knowledge of what happened, Commodus has Maximus branded a traitor and they try to kill him.There are events that happen that land Maximus a slave and owned by Proximo (Oliver Reed). He bought him to compete as a gladiator. Proximo can see the promise that Maximus has. It also leads him back to Rome, known as the Spaniard. Commodus flirts with becoming a dictator and those in the senate do not want that. Corruption is starting in Rome and Maximus could be a tool to fix it.Now while writing this, I did realize something. I didn't know that Marcus and Commodus are real people. I didn't look deeper to see if the events that happened here or real or not, because this feels like it is borrowing from Spartacus. If there is truth here or not, I love this story. We have a revenge story at its core. I'm fascinated by world history where this is set. The gladiator battles are something else that are fascinating to me. There is an interesting commentary here on government corruption that is social relevant as well. You could say that the United States is flirting with this now on both sides. As someone who loves commentary, you have me on board.If you don't care about subtext, we still have good performances. It is funny seeing a man from New Zealand play a Spaniard, but Crowe is good. He has charisma for this role, especially to entertain the audiences. Phoenix is a great villain. Nielsen is good along with Spencer Treat Clark as her son. I also liked seeing Djimon Hounsou as another slave and even Tommy Flanagan. We also get a great cast of older actors here with smaller roles like Reed, Harris, Derek Jacobi, David Schofield, John Shrapnel, Tomas Arana and David Hemmings. Along with the casting, I love the battle scenes. This movie goes brutal with the effects, which I appreciate. There is a gritty and dirty feel to the fighting that feels real. This is a film that holds up after multiple watches in my opinion and I can see why it is sits in the Top 100 on IMDb. Plus, Ridley Scott could direct the heck out of a movie.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",NA
"questl-18592","2 December 2021","This right here? Undisputed King of the Modern Day Swords and Sandals genre. It just hits that perfect note of an epic without feeling contrived or over indulgent. Ridley Scott really did something masterful here because I think this film showed an exceptional deft touch in terms of balancing accuracy and legitimacy with the feel of the movie, that emotional resonance that can overwrite some nonsense.Crowe's understated, quiet performance is perfect for Maximus and Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus is just a reminder of how skilled that man is. It's a real Batman/Joker kind of vibe with the stoic hero and the crazy, sadist villain and Phoenix is able to put these layers in there that make Commodus feel so complex and deep. It's something we're missing from a lot of villains these days who are just ""I'm big and bad because... Because!"" Instead he manages to make this character both sniveling and pathetic but also terrifying!After all this praise, it's weird to say that I don't love this movie. It's good, great even but it never quite hit me right. I never mind watching it, but also never really feel like seeking it out. This just happened to be on and I didn't change the channel or stream and wound up watching it and you know what? It's great for that, because it's a good watch.",NA
"icclyf","19 July 2020","Great Story! Great Writing! Great Acting! Great Directing! Great Score! This movie has it all. I especially enjoyed the mood of the film. Even though it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style. The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations. Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the ""general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor."" Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine. It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla. However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles. Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers. Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo, the trainer for the gladiators. The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the ""thrill of the Coliseum"" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate. The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene. But the whole movie is a rush! Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie. Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing. I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages. Next to Braveheart, this movie is the greatest of all-time!",NA
