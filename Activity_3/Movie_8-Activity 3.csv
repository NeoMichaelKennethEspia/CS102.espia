"Gladiator","hitchcockthelegend","6 August 2014","Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.I didn't know man could build such things.Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10","

"Gladiator","mahmus","11 October 2020","Gladiator is the best bread and circus. A moving and very entertaining action epic with Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix at the top of their game.I absolutely love Joaquin Phoenix in this movie. He's the kind of villain you love to hate. So pathetic and childish. So ruthless and creepy. Just right amount of cartoonish. I wanted to punch him in the face.It can be corny and it drags a bit during the escape plan part of the plot, but it has enough emotion and brutal violence to keep the audience entertained, and that's what a good gladiator match should be.","

"Gladiator","Sleepin_Dragon","12 March 2022","One of the best films of a generation, it's a bold claim, but Gladiator truly is that good. Every single element is perfect, the story is phenomenal, one to absorb you for the full running time. The visuals are incredible, an epic masterpiece for the eyes as well as the soul. The acting first rate, surely the aim of any film is to move you, this does just that and then some.The best of Russell Crow are far as I'm concerned, he really does command the screen throughout, Joaquin Phoenix is just as good, it makes me so sad that this was the last film of the late great Oliver Reed, and of course he's awesome.I must also comment on the incredible soundtrack, the sublime music of Has Zimmer coupled with the ancient, enchanting voice of Lisa Gerrard, the music is the same glorious standard as the film, Now we are free still gives me chills, and takes me back to the film.One of my top ten films of all time, a masterpiece, 10/10.","

"Gladiator","david-meldrum","21 August 2020","20 years on, the first DVD I bought is still a barnstorming, thrilling ride. There's so much to recommend this - Lisa Gerrard & Hans Zimmer's iconic score, the canny casting of Joaquin Phoenix as a foil for Crowe; the realisation that I quote this film in everyday conversation far more than I thought I did. If it should have won the Oscars is a moot point - this is another of Ridley Scott's superb worldbuilding - one of his primary film-making skills, giving us a Rome that feels recognisable yet still a break from the cliché's that had seeped in to popular culture before this. That the film's status was boosted by the DVD boom as it made its way to home release is undeniable, but this remains a film that thrills, absorbs and grips.","

"Gladiator","0U","24 February 2020","Gladiator is a historical epic from director Ridley Scott. After being betrayed by the new Caesar, Roman general Maximus is sold into slavery as a gladiator where he rises to fame as a people's champion and finds an opportunity to exact his revenge. Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Connie Nielsen lead the cast and deliver strong performances. Additionally, the gladiator fights are especially dynamic and exciting, featuring several different styles of combat. The costumes and sets are also remarkably well-done, and create a vivid depiction of ancient Rome. And, Hans Zimmer's score does an excellent job at capturing the tone of the film. Thrilling and action-packed, Gladiator delivers a compelling tale. ""Are you not entertained?!""","

"Gladiator","TheLittleSongbird","15 May 2009","Ridley Scott rarely disappoints with his films. All of them, including the unjustly-maligned Legend, are visually stunning and just show the director's artistic genius. Gladiator should be up there as one of the best films he's done, if not the best. Almost everything on screen is very graphic, making some scenes upsetting to watch, but the visuals are just outstanding. The music score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the drama that is already there in the script. which is well written and rather Shakespearean. The performances were brilliant, especially Joaquin Pheonix and Oliver Reed. Russell Crowe is wholly convincing in the title role, and Richard Harris and Connie Nielson are also excellent. The costumes are brilliant, as well as the sets. In conclusion, Gladiator is a near masterpiece, only marred by some upsetting scenes. 9/10 Bethany Cox.","

"Gladiator","jaredpahl","9 July 2017","Gladiator, 2000's Best Picture winner, was undoubtedly one of the biggest successes of the decade. It made tons of box-office cash, nearly swept the Oscars, and revitalized the sword-and-sandals genre for years to come. Does the movie warrant the massive success it received? For the most part, yes. Ridley Scott's Roman blockbuster doesn't have quite the overwhelming emotion of another Oscar-winning epic, Braveheart, but as a brawny action spectacle, Gladiator soars. With a strong story, a profound sense of character, and action and special effects that are suitably exciting, Gladiator is a special kind of sword-and-sandals picture; One with a true dramatic core.Like the great epics of Hollywood's past, Gladiator is simple in its story. Russell Crowe stars as the Roman General, Maximus, whose life is thrown into chaos after the jealous Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) arranges for his execution. Maximus is sold into slavery where he meets Proximo, a former gladiator played by Oliver Reed who shepherds him through life as a gladiator as Commodus scrambles to stop Maximus' influence among the people. The story of Gladiator is a rock-solid tale of revenge, bolstered by well written characters, some sly political subtext, and a couple of stellar performances from Crowe and Phoenix. The two principle characters, Maximus and Commodus, are what separates Gladiator from the slew of sword-and-sandals epics that came after it. They are simply but elegantly written as characters; Maximus, a man singularly driven by a need to return to his family, Commodus, a confused young man singularly driven by a need to be loved. However, it is the performances from Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix that really elevate this material. Phoenix gives a brilliant portrait of an emotionally frustrated young man. He is completely unpredictable, but he never becomes campy. He is a real person with real problems, and there is an underlying sadness to his character that makes him so much more interesting than your typical stock villain. As for Crowe, his performance is all about physical presence. Apart from a few big emotional scenes, Crowe's performance is one of quiet masculine stoicism. He adds a remarkable gravitas to this character that all but makes the movie. You feel for him, you relate to him, you root for him, and you become inspired by him. It is a perfect heroic performance. The character stuff in Gladiator really works. Coming from a genre that made do with archetypal characters doing obligatory British accents for years, it is nothing short of a revelation that Gladiator is such a fulfilling dramatic experience. Here are characters you actually care about and not simply placeholders to string up the plot in between action scenes.When it comes to general filmmaking, Gladiator is rarely pedestrian and often astounding. Apart from some strange quirks in the filmmaking like the seemingly digitized zooms or the moments when the frame rate seems to cause a weird flicker effect, Gladiator is a deep, rich, and meticulously detailed visual experience. Hollywood production values don't get much higher than this. The technical departments are tops in terms of production design and costuming. The movie looks expensive, but there is something else in Gladiator's visual style that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. The look of the film, with its mix of traditional, large- scale sets and CG enhancements, is almost dreamlike. The environments of Ridley Scott's version of ancient Rome, including a painstakingly crafted digital recreation of the famous Colosseum, seem untethered to any kind of physical reality. It's as if what Scott has created is an environment that reflects the feeling of Ancient Rome rather than the reality of it. Just as with the deep characters and eloquent script, there's a modern feeling to Ridley Scott's filmmaking in Gladiator. The reliance on CGI is sometimes overdone, but in conjunction with the costumes, sets, and impressively grandiose score from Hans Zimmer, it adds to the intoxicating atmosphere of Ridley Scott's world.The main attraction of Gladiator is its scenes of gladiatorial combat, and on that front, Ridley Scott aptly gets the job done. There are a few moments when Scott falls back on to standard sword clashing and disorientating shaky cam, but for the most part, the action scenes are exciting, bloody, and imaginatively staged. The best action scenes are the opening Barbarian battle and a fantastic fight scene between Maximus, a veteran gladiator, and a Colosseum full of bloodthirsty tigers. In those scenes, Scott's emphasis on close-up, sweaty, brutal action is totally effective. I felt the cold of the forest mud, the heat of the flaming trees, the sharpness of the swords, and the dusty claustrophobia of the Arena. The action of Gladiator is visceral and bloody, and there is plenty of it. Those hungry for bloodsport will find more than enough manly derring-do to satiate their red-blooded desire.For all its dramatic depth, I can't say I came out of Gladiator heavily affected by feeling. This is still, at its core, a visceral experience, but the small character moments and the textured performances are miraculously riveting. I was intrigued by every second of Gladiator. The action scenes are thrilling, the dramatic scenes are mesmerizing, and the $103 million budget is all up there on the screen in every frame. Ridley Scott's direction is superlative, especially in the third act, as the story, action, and emotions reach a fever pitch. The last few scenes, including the climactic final showdown and the closing 'Elysium' scene, exhibit a crescendo of the kind of daring artistry that permeates the film's best sections. Gladiator is a meaty Hollywood epic of the best kind. It's visually sumptuous and supremely thrilling, but there is a beating heart within this beast. Sure there are a couple of bumps along the way, but with Crowe as the sturdy hero and a simple story of returning home, Gladiator stays with you long after the credits roll.92/100","

"Gladiator","ccthemovieman-1","1 November 2006","An intense Roman epic, a la ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Spartacus,"" it was nice to see something like this made again. It had been since the 1960s that we had seen a 3-hour extravaganza like this.Like Ben-Hur, this is a story of a successful man who loses everything thanks to an evil man, and then has to fight his way back up to seek revenge on that man and to obtain his freedom back. It's a tried-and-true formula. This movie doesn't go to excess on the violence as some of the other more recent epic films did, such as ""Braveheart"" or ""The Patriot.""The acting is excellent, beginning with Russell Crowe, who has established himself as one of the best actors of today. Joaquin Phoenix also put himself ""on the map"" as an actor with his portrayal of the evil ""Commodus."" He's so annoying you want to slap that sucker, which means he's doing a good job acting. Kudos to the rest of the cast, too.Too bad they don't make more of these type of films, as they did in the 1950s and 1960s.","

"Gladiator","Leofwine_draca","22 July 2016","An epic, awe-inspiring movie which thankfully shows us that Hollywood hasn't forgotten how to make good movies anymore, this is a film which has it all, from intrigue to suspense to violence to subtle romance. Forget any of the other CGI-laden rubbish filling out the multiplexes, this is a film which simply has to be seen at the cinema - or alternatively on a very big television screen indeed. Due to the fact that this film was hyped up incredibly, it doesn't actually live up to the hype, but nothing could have done. GLADIATOR is pure, old-fashioned escapism, nothing less.For once, the acting is totally flawless. Russell Crowe comes out of nowhere to give us a powerful, sensitive action hero, able to emote without the use of dialogue, delivering his lines when needed with a gruff British accent. Crowe is a revelation here - I hated him in VIRTUOSITY, but his acting is excellent and finely judged, right up there with the brooding intensity of De Niro or Pacino. He is well supported by a varied cast, including Connie Nielsen who makes a very sultry and alluring love interest. Joaquin Phoenix makes his snivelling, whining emperor truly despicable, easily soaking up the entire audience's hatred. Oliver Reed is also very good in what was to be his final role, as the proud but friendly slave owner who becomes Maximus' friend. Richard Harris lends an air of nobility and authenticity in his brief role as the dying emperor Caesar, while noted British actors Derek Jacobi and David Hemmings appear as senators.Okay, so the plot of revenge is a fairly clichéd one and the plot here is reminiscent of a whole number of other films, as well as MACBETH, but it is given added power and resonance by the great acting. The music score is also absolutely excellent and really adds to this film's atmosphere. Physically, it is beautifully made and extremely realistic - you constantly feel that you're in Rome itself. Everything is epic and the whole film is chock-full of grandeur. It looks lovely, it sounds lovely, hell, it is lovely.Director Ridley Scott doesn't skimp on the gore front either, leaving in some gruesome shots of people being cut in half, being decapitated and blood spraying in the air and all over the place. The battle scenes are the highlight of the film and are filmed in a weird way - sometimes sped up, sometimes slowed down - which make them so realistic that you do feel like you're there. They're also very exciting, with Crowe taking on ferocious tigers, masked hulking warriors, and chariots too. The twists and turns in the plot are unexpected and there's a moving, poignant ending giving this film an extra element. Old-fashioned, well-crafted and truly splendid - any movie fan owes it to themselves to see this film.","

"Gladiator","shoktart","19 February 2001","Great Story!  Great Writing!  Great Acting!  Great Directing!  Great Score! This movie has it all.  I especially enjoyed the mood of the film.  Even though it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style.  The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations.  Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the ""general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor.""  Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus.  Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine.  It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla.  However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles.  Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers.  Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo, the trainer for the gladiators.  The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the ""thrill of the Coliseum"" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate.  The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene.  But the whole movie is a rush!  Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie.  Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing.  I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages.  Next to Braveheart, this movie is the greatest of all-time!","

It has a strong female character, positive and realistic minority rep (the Roman Empire extended into Africa and I think lots of people forget that), and a compelling revenge plot. Every line moves the plot forward and is memorable. The music is gorgeous. The acting is impeccable. The visuals are absolutely stunning - especially the rose petals raining down as the emperor is ascending on the platform. The visual of the emperor dead in the colosseum while the crowd lifts Maximus away. The whole concept of Elysium makes me cry every time. The ending couldn't have wrapped everything up better.","

"Gladiator","moondoggy88","6 March 2002","I borrowed this movie on DVD, but I wish I had seen it in the theater for it would have been a lot more fun and powerful there. Despite this, Gladiator is one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen. The plot goes so smooth together, as well as the acting and the terrific musical score. Director Ridley Scott puts all effort into making this film an epic, and he does just that. I'd have to say that anyone who likes Ridley Scott (I sure do) should see this. It is a lot like Ridley's other movies (Black Hawk Down was also amazing). If you can stand a little bit--well, ok a LOT of blood and gore, then you should see this. Russell Crowe shows an excellent performance like no other. I don't think there's one bad movie that Ridley Scott has made or that Russell Crowe has acted in. The fact that the brutal battles involving innocent slaves in this film actually happened in real life centuries ago makes it even more interesting and powerful. Emperor Commodus is a truely evil and life-like villian who shows a lot of his wits in attempts to get his revenge against Maximus.Ridley Scott went to many different locations to shoot this film to make it real, and he does. The film is set in Rome, and it looks just like it. You feel as if you are there in the crowd, hearing them cheer and cheer to see the death. To some of you, this may sound a little barbaric, and believe me the film is VERY barbaric and brutual, however it teaches a very strong lesson of what happens when an economy turns as violent as Rome was. Ridley Scott goes to many lengths to make this movie real, because even though the characters are fictitious, all of this really did happen. Innocent people had to go through brutual fighting while thousands of people cheered for either their death or the enemy's death. If you were an inexperienced fighter, chances are you would get killed. But the strange thing is that Rome LOVED this. People came from all over to see these fights and to see the blood that was shed, that is why you can't blame the characters in this film for being so forlorn and saddened the whole time. The film itself is very dark. The theme is dark and the ending is dark. From beginning to end there is excessive violence (for those action movie-goers, this is a movie for you). But if the violence is concerning you, don't let it. The special effects make the movie great, but it's the acting and storyline that make it spectacular. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED for anyone who wants a good time. Definitely makes you think. ***** out of *****.","

"Gladiator","Russell_","12 September 2005","""Gladiator"" definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple, but moving, story with beautiful scenery, filming, direction and score  it is truly a ""complete"" movie.I am mostly compelled with the beautiful script which in a way reminds me of poetry, though it is still everyday language. I love the acting portrayed by the late Oliver Reed and also Richard Harris. Russell Crowe, Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less ""popular"" artists who also deserve a big ""bravo"". Amongst them I have to mention ex-Mr Universe Ralph Moeller who is mostly used as the comic relief of the movie. In Gladiator we can also the beautiful and popular Maltese TV Star and actress Ruth Frendo, who although has a small part, she is totally brilliant and outstanding.Actually I got to IMDb while I was looking for her name on the internet, in fact on IMDb she has some very stunning photos. I was lucky to meet Ruth Frendo whilst she was filming in another Maltese production. Ruth Frendo is not only a gorgeous and talented actress but she is also amazingly intelligent and very down-to-earth. We will definitely be seeing more of her work in the future... The scenery used for ""Gladiator"" is brilliant  and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie; and I love the light contrasts thanks to the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal feel to the entire movie.""Gladiator"" deserves all the awards and great reviews it has received, and for those of you who still haven't gone and watched it  I can assure you that it will be well worth your time and money. So go on and rent it now!","

"Gladiator","angelo-29","6 June 2000","Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world. Well, you should see for yourself!","

"Gladiator","paulyb","2 May 2000","The epic blockbuster returns with the 21st Century's answer to Cecil B DeMille, Ridley Scott and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge, GLADIATOR - ""the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor"".Once a great roman General, and as good as adopted son of Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Harris), Maximus (Crowe) is forced into exile by Commodus (Phoenix), heir to the throne, after the death of Marcus. Saved from death by slavers, he is purchased for use as a gladiator by Proximo (Reed) and ends up in the arena of all arena's, the Colloseum, where he proves unbeatable under his guise as ""The Spaniard"".And with a budget of over $100m, Scott certainly delivers the goods. GLADIATOR transcends the notion of 'blockbuster' that we have become accustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and instead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus and and Ben Hur. Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that contains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss, courage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc etc) - also on offer is a visual feast of cinematic painting after painting - a rich tapestry of images that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the plains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to great Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended highly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film. The opening  battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the screen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays incredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way, Scott has created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings (and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky depths of film history where they belong.The cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the task with a great emotional range and depth of character. His accent ocassionally bugged me (as did the mish mash of accents on offer - but that is I guess a legacy of 'internationally casted films'), but this aside, he was well and truly up to the task. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus, as is Nielson as Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus who ""should have been a son"" and finds herself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is 'right'. The old guard thesps of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong as supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job as the young heir to the throne.Add to this great cast excellent editing and post production work, and an intricate soundscape (including a magnificent Hans Zimmer score), and you have a film that, despite its length, was highly palatable and had me in there from beginning to end. A must see.","

"Gladiator","uds3","30 May 2002","It saddens me that a man such as Ridley Scott can work for months on location bringing the most perceptive and detailed vision of ancient Rome to absolute reality, only to incur the inappropriate, juvenile and one dimensional comments such that I have read here - the following few ""reviews"" (and I use the term 'loosely') especially. Comments such as ""horrible movie,""  ""no interesting characters,"" ""bad acting"" and my personal favorite, ""crappy special effects,"" is a sad epitaph to the lack of awareness and utter stupidity of so many viewers.GLADIATOR is one of the finest movies ever made, I don't ""think"" it, I am telling you! Ridley Scott pulled off a jaw-dropping miracle reeling the finished product in at just on $60 million. It has the appearance, continuity and professional veneer of a $300 million production. It is in fact only an adaptation on Samuel Bronston's classic 1964 movie THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, itself the most literate and well-acted epic of the 50's and 60's...and again, the key figure of Marcus Aurelius is handled with such dignity, feeling and intelligence. In 1964 Sir Alec Guinness played Aurelius as a strong and clear-thinking man of moral strength and fortitude. In GLADIATOR, Richard Harris hands in what I consider his best role ever, portraying Aurelius as a political visionary, caring parent and incorruptible leader. Excellent though Russell Crowe is here, it is Ridley Scott makes the film what it is, together with the cinematography and enervating musical score. Russell has actually not that great a dialog overload! In the acting department, Phoenix blows him off the screen as the immoral, aggrieved and ultimately weak emperor in waiting. Oliver Reed as Proximo? Well, how he did not win best supporting actor posthumously I will never know. This is the greatest Oscar scandal in history as far as I am concerned. It was the role of his life and he took it in both hands and wrung his life out into the part....completely it would seem. He died as he would have wished, tanked and slipping off a bar stool in Malta towards the end of filming. But he gave us an unforgettable Proximo and I will long honor his name with the memory of what he did here.Crappy special effects huh?  Well, in the film I saw - I was looking at the COLOSSEUM, not a special effect. I was there with them. I have never seen any CGI effect come close to what these techos achieved. Can you believe there were no more than 48 people ever on set? The ""crowds"" were made up of the same 48 people wearing different clothes and ""matted"" together - you want to tell me it ""looked"" like that? The arena action certainly was a far cry from the ""Chariot Race"" in BEN HUR but there again, what isn't? It was still exciting stuff though, well for the vaguely cerebral set I hasten to add.A film like GLADIATOR comes along probably once every 40 years or so. Its a pity so many didn't notice it THIS time around. Still, you are probably outnumbered three to one.","

"Gladiator","gregatory","3 May 2000","Most films require that the viewer identifies with the character to truly be engrossed with the film. If you can't feel something for the character, than the audience is lost.Luckily, in Ridley Scott's case, Russel Crowe is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors today, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders.Not to say that he is the only reason this works. The supporting cast, most notably Connie Neilsen, buoy the film to new perspectives.Jacquin Phoenix definitely captures the egotisitcal persona he should display, stealing every scene he's in. Phoenix will surely be put on the map with Gladiator.But the real shining star in this film are the incredible action sequences which jolt the viewer right in with the opening sequences, as Maximus' true worth to the Roman Empire is displayed. Scott's camera work within these completed sequences takes a modern twist that really works for the gruesome scenes.Crowe will now get the respect he deserves for this collosal performance. Gladiator makes the most of its 2 and a half hours, marking a triumphant comeback for the long forgotten epics of the classic days of film. ALL HAIL MAXIMUS!","

"Gladiator","sddavis63","24 March 2002","The beginning of ""Gladiator"" is powerful. We see the Roman Legion fighting against the Germanic tribes in what surely must be one of the most spectacular battle scenes ever filmed; one which truly does give the viewer a taste of what warfare in that era must have been like. The ending is powerful, as the quest for vengeance finally comes to a head, with General Maximus facing the Emperor Commodus in a gladiatorial contest in the Roman arena. In between - well - things could have been a little better.The acting in this movie, I thought, was first-rate. Russell Crowe as General Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix as Emperor Commodus and Connie Nielsen as Lucilla, sister of Commodus, all played their parts perfectly. The gladiatorial bouts were superbly choreographed. The set decoration was magnificent, and looked exactly as I would expect Imperial Rome to have looked. So, why do I say this could have been better?(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Basically, the whole thing was just a bit too clear-cut for me. Maximus was too obviously the good guy, Commodus too obviously the bad guy. With this being so clear, we know that the movie must be heading for the final confrontation between the two, and it makes watching the middle 90 minutes or so difficult. ""Get on with it,"" I found myself thinking from time to time. It didn't have to be quite so clear cut. The potential was there to give the viewer a real ethical choice to make. I mean, one can understand Commodus being angry when Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) - his father - takes away the throne that Commodus had believed all his life would be his, and hands control of Rome over to Maximus. Commodus could have been a sympathetic character. He didn't have to murder his father. His father was elderly; a natural death wouldn't have been out of the question. And why the incestuous fascination with Lucilla? I didn't think it added anything to the movie - except to make Commodus even more repulsive. In the end, the movie didn't make me think about anything; it didn't challenge me with any moral decision-making; it didn't make choosing sides in this battle even remotely difficult.Don't get me wrong. This was a very good movie. One can always argue whether this movie or that should have been named best picture; one certainly has to agree that ""Gladiator"" was worthy of consideration. I just felt it could have been better. In the end, I give it a rating of 7/10.","

"Gladiator","copperccso","7 September 2002","I love history, and to me, Gladiator is a masterpiece. It is the most accurate picture of the Roman Empire Hollywood has ever put out.  People declare Spartacus a masterpiece, but Gladiator far outdoes Spartacus in quality.  The costuming, the acting, the screenplay, the scenery, and the fighting styles made me think that I had traveled back to 180 A.D. Russell Crowe is a true Hollywood tough guy, and he is superb in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as a villain, one of the best in movie history.  He played his character as if it were a psychologist's dream case. Connie Nielsen plays one of the strongest female characters that I have ever seen.  The choreographer of the action sequences was brilliant. Ridley Scott did an outstanding job in recreating the Empire, including the multitude of ethnic groups within the Empire and accurately depicting everyday life.  If you're looking for insight into what the Roman Empire was like, this is a perfect depiction.","

"Gladiator","bkoganbing","4 October 2020","35 years after Samuel Bronston and Anthony Mann gave us The Fall Of The Roman Empire, Ridley Scott told the same tale of the Emperor Commodus and
his problems succeeding his legendary father, Emperor/philosopher Marcus Aurelius. Neither film got the story right, both have him killing his father and
both have him with a hero/rival. In the Mann film it's Stephen Boyd in this film it is Russell Crowe. Both have a sister working against him Sophia Loren in the
Mann film and in the Ridley Scott film Connie Nielsen.Although I loved Christopher Plummer in The Fall Of The Roman Empire, truth be told Joaquin Phoenix is closer to the real Commodus. Commodus was only a teen when he became Emperor in 180 AD and reigned a lot longer than it seemed in Gladiator. In real life he was strangled by a wrestler who was part of a conspiracy. He did in fact love the Coliseum and did like to participate occasionally as is shown in both films.In this film when Joaquin Phoenix learns that Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius plans to name Russell Crowe one of his best fighting generals as his successor he kills Harris and Crowe's family. Crowe is sold off in bondage, but works his way back to Rome to take Phoenix down.Gladiator marks he farewell film of Oliver Reed who plays the head of the gladiator school who trains Crowe. Derek Jacobi plays a senator and as he did
in I Claudius dreams of reestablishing the republic.Gladiator won for Best Picture and Best Actor for Russell Crowe and also won for costume design, special effects, and best sound. Sharp film fans will see
bits of both Ben-Hur and Spartacus woven into the story.Gladiator is a well put together drama and Crowe and Phoenix have quite an acting duel. Maybe the real Commodus story will get a film one day. Until then Gladiator and The Fall Of The Roman Empire will do nicely.","

"Gladiator","Mr_PCM","7 December 2005","If only Peter Jackson hadn't come along and done a rather good trilogy of films, we might possibly be talking about the greatest film of the 21st Century so far. Its sweeping but simplistic heroic tale, crunching fight scenes, award-winning special effects, towering acting and soaring score set this film apart from all the pretenders that followed it. Ridley Scott single-handedly re-invented the epic genre with this story of a Roman solider who is betrayed, loses everything and is sold into slavery, only to fight his way back as a gladiator, all the while driven by vengeance for his murdered family.Russell Crowe gives quite simply the performance of a lifetime as the Gladiator Maximus, one that deservedly won him Best Actor at the 2000 Academy Awards (although his performance in the following year's Beautiful Mind was arguably even better, even if it didn't win him his second consecutive Oscar), and provided a thinking woman's alternative to the likes of Pitt, Cruise and Clooney to swoon over. His gravely voice and impressive physique combine to give him a huge presence, which literally fills the screen. His dialogue is sparing, but his actions speak far louder, adding a stoic sadness to his vengeance-driven heroic character. Before Gladiator, Crowe was a good secondary actor; after Gladiator he was catapulted to the top of Hollywood's A-list, and remains there, thanks to this career-making performance proving him to be one of the finest actors of his generation.Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the scheming and corrupt Emperor Commodus who betrays Maximus and has his family killed. He manages to be delightfully and totally evil without ever descending into the realms of pantomime villain, which is a tricky line to walk, and manages to avoid being overshadowed by Crowe's monumental performance.The fight scenes are rousing and superbly choreographed, in particular a scene where Maximus marshals his fellow slaves into an army against marauding chariot archers in the Colosseum. The dialogue is kept simple and never overbearing (no need to worry why all of Europe speaks the same language) and culminates in one of the most memorable pieces of script that is destined to join the ranks of 'Play it Sam' and 'Are you talking' to me' as one of the most quoted (and misquoted) lines in movie history  although it is rather wordy. But here it is, in full; 'My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius. Commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true Emperor Marcus Aurelius; Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.' As Crowe turns to the Emperor in the arena and delivers this line, it proves to be one of the most electrifying moments in cinema history  hairs will stand up, spines will tingle, guaranteed.The action is set to some truly beautiful music, and it is shameful Hans Zimmer missed out on the Oscar for Best Score. Ridley Scott was similarly unlucky in the Director category.The film is however tinged with sadness, as it proved to be the final (but triumphant) swansong for the careers of Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, both of whom died shortly after making this film. Neither could have delivered much finer performances, and if any performance had to be a final one, both delivered one worthy of such a status here. Reed in particular is a revelation, reminding older generations and showing a new generation of his considerable talent.An inspiring film, rousing, exhilarating, exciting and moving. Superbly acted, directed, scored and visualised. A tribute to how great films could be once, and could be again.","

"Gladiator","Nazi_Fighter_David","25 October 2005","When you go to the ruins of Rome now, you get really no sense of the scale and the grandeur of what that forum would have been It's hard to get it anywhere except from some of the great epic films of the past like ""Quo Vadis,"" ""Ben-Hur,"" ""Demetrius and the Gladiators,"" ""Barabbas,"" and ""The Fall of the Roman Empire."" Scott's ""Gladiator"" is build around a mythic character, a man trying to find his way home... It is around someone finding inner strength in a tough time Maximus is somebody who doesn't want to be a soldier We realize this is a man who is pursuing the ultimate which is transcending death and finding love after death which completely transforms your reaction to the man, a man who is very, very strong but very, very loving The plot, familiar from Anthony Mann's "" Fall of the Roman Empire,"" had Crowe as Maximus, the proud well-loved Roman general in the army of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Maximus whose motto is 'Strength and Honor' is like a son to Aurelius, a statement that left Aurelius' own son, Commodus perturbed...Disappointed by the news that his father privately decides to name Maximus his successor, and being a young ambitious son lusting for power, he murders his father, and orders a strike against the general... One of the best scenes of the motion picture is where Commodus is told by his father that he is not going to be the emperor Joaquin Phoenix is easy to hate in a frightening and vile character...Ridley Scott creates a lot of beautiful scenes between the characters He did some fantastic work in all of those wonderful scenes in the film But there's another moment between the emperor and his daughter Lucilla (the Danish beauty Connie Nielsen) that I loved very much Harris says, ""Let's not speak of politics. Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter and I'm a good father. "" They walk for a few seconds and Lucilla says, ""This is a pleasant fiction."" I felt this short scene so sophisticated It seemed to me wonderfully insightful, simple in terms of amount of words, but complex in terms of understanding this strange relationship One of the most successful bits of casting was Oliver Reed He's a harsh and rough businessman who makes his living off the death machine and yet, inside, there was some kind of ethical person that would come out at the right momentRidley Scott's epic film does not romanticize a democratic Golden Age of Rome but a decaying, blood thirsty empire on the edge of its fall... Through its beautiful music, through Russell's performance and through Ridley's soulfulness, ""Gladiator"" brought a poetic vision in a new and very cinematically richly way that really gave the audience something different, so emotional and so intimate","

"Gladiator","RayCharles81","9 December 2023","I love when you haven't seen a great movie in five years and then happen to stumble on it on the perfect night to revisit it, somewhat forgetting much of it, or at least the affecting impact it can have on you. That was me with Gladiator recently.Most has already been said, so I want to just zoom in on a couple or parts and features. Before I do, it's a great and rarely acknowledged fact that although most of the story is fictionalized, in reality, Commodus was really infatuated with the Gladiator games; he also did indeed compete and corruptly fabricated his win-loss record. Outside of the Coliseum arena, he had a statue of himself enshrined that listed his record at something like 60 wins and no losses. However, he could rig any match he wanted and most historical accounts dispute he fought on that many matches- he may have been in a dozen or so, but doubtfully was he in that many. Also, while it would be cool if, like in the film, another gladiator fought him like that in the ring, in reality, it was Commodus' trainer that was supposedly responsible for his demise. This is interesting because while many of the story components are inaccurate, one might assume that Commodus' character was completely made up also, but he truly was a big fan and even competitor in the games.The staging of the scenery and background construction of Rome is absolutely brilliant and breathtaking. It makes you really feel like you're there in many scenes. How many movies can transport you back to experience legendary Rome two thousand years ago?Even more so brilliant is how not much has changed. Sure, our athletes don't fight to the death and now get paid sufficiently, but the relation and comparison to modern day sports events is vividly shown. The same is true for the politics- yeah, it's all in there in there. While the political components are not a deep dive, the film touches on enough philosophies and strategic realities to go a little and just enough beyond the surface to paint the picture that little has changed. There's corruption, schmoozing, contempt, grandstanding, loyalties, and nepotism.Phoenix is so entertaining to watch playing the sick, twisted, power hungry, bloodlusting emporer, especially when he's enjoying the battle of Carthage. He is truly outstanding in this role, arguably missing out on an early career, deserved Oscar award. While many of his scenes are disturbing, he is always riveting.This is a movie you will lose yourself in.The Battle of Carthage is truly awesome. This was a very elaborate and complex sequence with lots of moving parts, showing that director Scott wasn't just phoning it in. When the chariot crashes through the gate, you really feel the tides turn, like this isn't what Commodus and his organizers expected. Cutting back and forth to Commodus' reactions was a great decision and likewise with all the senators' and Connie Nielson's. That was my favorite match.My second favorite match was Tigris. What a spectacle it was having the tigers pop out from underground, and Commodus' disappointment again having thought he rigged Maximus' demise was again a great revelation.Every scene is well acted, even the behind the action scenes with Commodus and his sulister, Gracchus, and Proximo and Maximus.It's truly a classic and awesome film experience. Ridley Scott must have had a ""no bull----"" rule while making the movie because it really doesn't waste a second and with sequences like Carthage battle going right into the Commodus-Maximus confrontation, and then how quickly the film goes from battle to battle, it just feels like a filmmaker who is not screwing around. I think this has to be appreciated much more, as we know so many movies today waste time and meander.My only complaint was that we didn't get to see the promised, would-be invasion of Rome with Maximus escaping and returning with his five thousand soldiers. That would have been epic beyond epic. Instead, we get a good showdown. But to its credit, I'll give it this: Maximus at least kept half of his promise, and the end result was much the same since Commodus could no longer rule and the sister and Gracchus honored Aurelias' final wish (no invasion necessary in that regard, still I would've liked the action and suspense more).Even though many try to criticize the scripts simplicity, I disagree and find the dialogue and monologues to be quality drama and somewhat Shakespearean at times. Even the weaker scenes that were probably added are just drowned out in the action and serve their purpose to keep the audience informed.And make no mistake here: this is a visual movie, and there is much more said and conveyed in the close ups of the facial expressions of the main characters, from evil glances, to vengeful scowls, to shaking jaws, tearful eyes, frightened faces, mad bloodlusting tongue stick outs, and hopeful daydream-like optimistic smiles.We all know what's going on here, witnessing humanity at its' corrupted, animalistic worst and heroic, godly, and noble best. The end result is a masterpiece of visual, visceral spectacle and drama about one man's fall and rise by honor and heroism and another's rise and fall by corruption and cowardice, in front of the backdrop of one of the seven great wonders of the world. It doesn't get much more epic than this these days!I hope my review is merciful and you are all entertained!","

"Gladiator","drqshadow-reviews","21 July 2020","A number of giant, career-making performances (plus another impressive turn in the director's chair for Ridley Scott) fuel this rich, hard-hitting saga of betrayal, grief and revenge in imperial Rome. The dueling fates of Maximus (Russell Crowe) and Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) share the front and center, twin note-perfect parts that continuously clash over the spotlight, but dozens of supporting players also deserve recognition. Richard Harris as the guilt-ridden sage, Marcus Aurelius. Oliver Reed chewing scenery as a grizzled, cynical combatant-turned-slaver. Djimon Hounsou and Ralf Moeller, comrades in arms who convey an intimate, crucial sense of kinship. As an intensely emotion-driven story, Gladiator can't function without this level of acting power. In less capable hands, it might be laughed off the screen. With Crowe, Phoenix and company in command - and, again, Scott there to expertly piece it all together amid an appropriately epic score by Hans Zimmer - we're swept off our feet.It's an enveloping film; a thick flood of sights, sounds and moods. We marvel over the bustling Roman Colosseum, tense our muscles in the raging chaos of battle, find peace in the metaphor of golden wheat fields as an afterlife. Maximus's justified outrage becomes our own, Commodus (with his barely-contained mania) our bane, and once it's got those hooks in, the script doesn't give an inch. An exceptionally powerful production, damn near perfect in all respects.","

"Gladiator","almagz","19 November 2005","There is so little to find wanting in this film and not wanting to merely repeat its many deserved praises, all I can do is question a couple of historical points.It is unlikely that a Roman general would be sold into slavery and forced to fight in the arena. Exiled, yes. Killed maybe. Asked to commit suicide to retain his property, most likely. It is unlikely that he would return to find his family crucified, of all things. Romans were very specific about who got crucified and why. Romans usually avoided it, no matter how cruel the tyrant(?) was.Roman legionnaires would NEVER have a tattoo unless they were barbarians who got one BEFORE joining a legion. Marking or mutilating the human body was expressedly anti- Roman. No statue or depiction exists of a main-period Roman showing a body-marking. The bonding feature the writer was attempting was an inappropriate borrowing from the 20th century German SS.Great entertaining movie nonetheless.","

"Gladiator","BenNicholson123","8 November 2005","Gladiator! A thrilling tale of a Roman general who must battle against all thinkable odds to avenge the death of his family and restore justice to the empire. The plot is simple, legendary general Maximus Decimus Meridius, after many victorious campaigns and battles wants to return to his peaceful home in Spain, However the kind, fair and dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius wishes to bestow his title on him over his cruel son, Commodus. Commodus is understandably annoyed and kills his father calming the title of Emperor. Maximus is sentenced to death along with the rest of his family back at his home in Spain. Maximus escapes but is unable to save his wife and son. His loss of will to live makes him an east target for slavers and he is soon sold as a gladiator. He fights his way into the coliseum in Rome were he wins over the crowd and uses his celebrity status to defy the Emperor, to whom he swears his vengeance for the death of his family, after many battles and political backstabbing he gets his chance to fight the Emperor in the Arena.This is just such an amazing film, it captures every emotion possible in only the way an expert director can achieve, we can go on for whole scenes without the need for speaking, everything is told through the genuine body language and expressions. And when there is conversing we get such emotion and wonderfully powerful quotes  ""What we do in life, echoes in eternity"" Wow.The opening scene is spellbinding, showing the true gore of battle, the fight scenes are marvellously realistic, discarding the popular ""pretty"" sword fighting for brutal aggressive force. The audience in the arena express every emotion, surprise, anger, and enjoyment. The cast is brilliantly chosen; we can really see Russell Crowe as a gladiator, in Commodus, Joaquin Phoenix gives us a man we can really hate, Connie Nielson shows real emotion and passion in the role of Lucilla. So apart from the spellbinding acting, scarily realistic fight scenes and the amazing script, what else can we look for? The music is just stunning, its exactly what we need brought in at exactly the right time, truly wonderful directing. And then we have the stunning special effects, we can really visualise the greatness that is Rome, the fight scenes really make you believe. Some critics have condemned the lack of historical fact, for instance an emperor would never fight a gladiator, and these comments cannot be denied, its true.But I think we can forgive them that one fault for such an amazing movie. Without hesitation I give this movie a truly deserved 10/10!","

"Gladiator","wideawakedreamer","4 June 2000","The movie is the story of Maximus (Crowe), a general who leads the Roman army to victory over Germania in the beginning of the movie. The dying emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius, is watching this battle.The emperor's son, Commodus, then arrives with his sister Lucilla, and it is discovered that Commodus fully expects to be announced the new emperor of Rome in a few days. Aurelius, however, has other plans--he wants to make Maximus emperor, and requests that of the general, who wants nothing more than to go home to his family.I went into this movie having just watched Ben-Hur in my film studies class and having watched an episode of Xena only a couple of weeks earlier that featured the story of Marc Anthony and Cleopatra. So you could say I was in the perfect mindset to watch a ""sword-and-sandal"" movie. I wasn't sure what to expect, having somehow avoided all the hype that accompanied this movie. But I was not disappointed.Gladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The battle scenes are very graphic. (This movie is not for the squeamish, that's for sure.) There were some scenes in particular that really struck me, such as when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast.  The use of color and color tones added a great deal to the mood of the movie. Excellent.The script was being written and re-written as the filming was going on, yet it doesn't show that the actors had no idea how the movie was going to end when they began filming.  The acting is terrific. Russell Crowe is wonderfully cast as Maximus. Many reviewers agree that he is now officially a star. Joaquin Phoenix also proves his mettle as the emotionally troubled Commodus, whose behavior and emotion toward his sister could give anyone the creeps. Connie Nielsen makes you believe that, as Lucilla, she really is torn between natural loyalty to her brother and doing what she knows is right. Oliver Reed, in his last performance, is memorable in his role of Proximo, the former gladiator who is the owner of Maximus and brings him to Rome.  In short, the actors were brilliant in their roles, not over-acting, but giving subtle, strong performances.The script itself is very good.  Although some elements are a little hard to believe--the fact that no one recognizes Maximus when he's a slave?--this film calls for a willing suspension of disbelief, which one would happily comply with.  (It's really no fun to nitpick such a movie.)It's true that this movie does pretty much follow the Braveheart formula. However, this movie includes some elements, such as the cinematography and the incredibly graphic battle scenes (one reviewer likened it to Saving Private Ryan, ""only better""), that are spectacular in itself. Overall, a great movie that I highly recommend.","

"Gladiator","comingaround","19 August 2000","This is wonderful storytelling.  The opening Battle Scene simply mesmerizes, showing the brutal nature of combat for Roman conquests.  I went back to see the film again.  The first time I didn't hear anything Crowe said before the battle.  I was just too visually caught-up.  The second time I listened very closely and caught the wise yet succinct line from Maximus ""what we do in life... echoes in eternity.""  Awesome.A simple man v. an emperor.  I just loved the resilience Maximus showed throughout the movie.  I find in most movies, there is an irritatingly slow process where the character has to ""find himself,"" not so with Gladiator. Maximus does what is needed.I liked how there were only two or three issues within this film.  One was the afterlife.  Aspects of the afterlife are opened, but not overdone.  Love of family is given sizable focus. I liked the theme of love of country that we see as well, although it may not be justly deserved, it is never questioned.The visual effects were amazing.  It actually had me wanting to believe that's the way Rome actually looked in all it's glory.  The battle of Carthage reenactment was really great.The ending is just hypnotic. Intentionally or unintentionally it was simply emotional.  The music is wonderfully beautiful as if Maximus' family are telling him...you have arrived.Bottom line: magnificent.  Visually and emotionally satisfying.","

"Gladiator","screenman","6 January 2008","Evaluating opinion of this movie by the 'Hated It' selection, I lost count of the number of contributors who gave it just one star. I thought they were being unnecessarily 'Roman' in their ruthlessness, but the result does show how disappointed so many viewers were and the extent to which this movie has polarised opinion.I diplomatically place myself somewhere in the middle.For me, scepticism set-in at the outset. That much-vaunted battle scene didn't sit right at all. In combat, the greatest Roman strength lay in the legion. The scrupulously drilled and disciplined foot-soldiers worked in unison, advancing upon enemies in their orderly units and maniples.Their Shields interlocked to create a mobile wall that could form-up on all flanks and even provide overhead protection. In between, they used their short, stabbing swords.The legions, then, were only at their best in the open. In dense forest, their advantages would have been squandered, any fight being a brawl upon the same terms as the enemy. Morover, their big Shields would have been an encumbrance and the short swords inadequate. A good Roman general drew the enemy out to fight on his terms, not the other way round. I'm not a scholar of Roman warfare; it may be there were occasions when Romans had no choice, but this is where the question marks began to pop-up. Check out the impeccable piece in 'Spartacus', where the Roman legions deploy by the textbook, drawing their enemy down from the hill. Perhaps Mr Scott felt that a more faithful rendering would seem like too much of a rip-off. In any case, this battle is quite incidental, and seems to exist only to grip the viewer's attention for the next couple of flatulent hours.Neither was I aware that the Roman army employed fire-bombs. It's not for me to say they didn't, but I have no reference to this tactic at all.I thought Ridley Scott made a futile attempt to create an 'arty' film. The frequent dream-like flashbacks to a hand running through spears of corn reminded me of the recurrent unicorn dream from his fascinating but equally pretentious 'Blade Runner'. From time to time there's even the same high-pitched warbling 'oriental' chorus, intended to project mood, but failing again. Some directors don't seem to realise that cinema-goers have memories.General Gruntus Maximus (Russel Crowe) surely got the easiest Oscar in history. He was believable as an uneducated slob in the way, perhaps, Spartacus should have been; but cerebral enough to be a general? I don't think so. And you don't rise to be a career general in an army whilst obsessing as a farmer about your harvest. You're either one, or the other.There was one particularly absurd scene in the arena when he was chopping-down competitors as quickly as they could be set against him. What then - weren't they trained gladiators, too? I was half-expecting him to begin walking sideways along the arena walls like 'Neo' from 'Matrixus'.As to the 'spectacle' of Rome; well, that was all just computer-generated hokum. The back-room boys can whip-up anything in that way now just by tapping a few keys, so what's the big deal? Check-out the 'real' thing in 'Fall Of The Roman Empire'.As with 'Titanic' and 'Pearl Harbour' a splendid opportunity was missed here to do something really wonderful, but because of flawed vision and misplaced directorial self-belief we finished up with mediocrity. Glorious mediocrity.Still, bread and circuses usually please the crowds.","

"Gladiator","Hancock_the_Superb","21 December 2007","In Rome circa 185 AD, General Maximus (Russell Crowe) leads a successful expedition against Germanic tribes in the northern empire. Dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) confides that he is to succeed as Emperor, to the chagrin of the vain, ego-maniacal Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who kills Marcus and usurps the throne. Maximus is expelled from the army, his family is killed, and he ultimately ends up in Rome as a gladiator for Proximo (Oliver Reed). Defying the will of the Emperor and eager to have his revenge, Maximus becomes a hero to the masses and joins Commodus's sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and a cabal of Senators led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) in an attempt to bring down Commodus.Gladiator is something of a paradox. As a well-made, entertaining action film, it's hard to beat. Its attempts to be something more, however... not so much. It's very entertaining, an excellent crowd-pleaser to be sure, but it's far from the great film it's widely considered to be.Gladiator wants to be something significant. Its multi-faceted plot, its commentary on society, its distinguished cast of actors, epic battle scenes, and great musical score almost push it there. The movie borrows heavily from ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" (settings and characters), ""Spartacus"" and ""Ben-Hur"" (for the plot). This is not a criticism, merely an observation. And the movie does have an inkling of being something more than just another action movie. And yet it fails, because at heart it is basically ""Braveheart"" in a toga.Perhaps I'm just not enthralled by the film's basic storyline. See if this sounds familiar: A successful warrior who wants only to live in peace is roused to ass-kicking action by the death of his family at the hands of cartoonishly evil villains. This is the plot of ""Braveheart"", ""The Patriot"", and innumerable Westerns, action films, and Steven Seagal/Chuck Norris slugfests. Death of family members is an easy motivation for a character, and dare I suggest a lazy one. Maximus isn't a thoughtful, conflicted hero like T.E. Lawrence or Spartacus, he's just a man of action who wants to wreak vengeance on those who wronged him. In spite of its attempts to convince us otherwise, the movie is basically a Schwarzenegger or Van Damme flick set in Roman times with a lead actor who can act.The subplots of the film don't fare much better. The character of Commodus in particular is a disappointment. One of the few good things about ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" is Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Commodus. Commodus is an egomaniac with delusions of grandeur. He's not horribly complex in that film but Plummer makes it work. Whether it's the script or Joaquin Phoenix's acting, this film's Commodus is a sniveling weakling. I appreciate the effort to give him motivation (his father never truly loved him) but in his big scene with Marcus Aurelius, Commodus doesn't come across as heart-broken, merely insincere. Commodus is a petulant child who lacks menace. David Schofield's duplictious Senator Falco is a much more effective bad guy. The Senate plot against the Emperor is under-developed and comes across as a bad pastiche of ""Spartacus"".On a purely action level, the movie is pretty good. The epic battle which opens the film is not particularly impressive in my opinion, but the gladiator combats later in the film are impressive. The visceral thrill of a gladiatorial match comes across well, particularly when Proximo's gladiators ""upset"" an enemy team. The fight between Maximus and the ""Tigress of Gaul"" is very well-handled, as is the final duel between Commodus and Maximus. The CGI is of mixed quality. It's impressive in some scenes (notably Commodus's entry into Rome) but in other parts it's murky and distracting. Hans Zimmer's score is haunting and helps drive the film's more powerful moments.The movie excels largely because of Russell Crowe. FOTRE failed because Stephen Boyd is a block of wood; Crowe, playing a very similar role, excels. Maximus is not a particularly noble hero but he's a fabulous action star, and Crowe does bring a degree of intelligence and complexity to complement the ass-kicking. The supporting cast is mostly under-used. Djimon Honsou, Oliver Reed, David Schofield and Derek Jacobi give the most memorable supporting performances in the film despite very limited screen time. Richard Harris is disappointing as Marcus Aurelius, and Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen aren't particularly compelling either.""Gladiator"" is one of the best action films ever made, on a purely action level. But in its attempts to be something more... well, not so much, I'm afraid.7/10","

"Gladiator","planktonrules","12 February 2012","Visually, ""Gladiator"" is a masterpiece. I saw a documentary about how they made this film long before I saw the actual movie and it's amazing to see how they used CGI to construct an enormous FULL stadium even though most of it wasn't real! The costumes, props, chariots and trappings were also gorgeous--as good as anything you'll ever see in a film about ancient Rome. And, with some spectacular stunts and TONS of blood, it is brutal--but spectacularly brutal. You really have to see this film and it will knock your socks off.If you look at my summary, however, I say that the film is a bit disappointing as well. As a retired history teacher, I know that much of the history shown in this film is wildly inaccurate. It bears only a very superficial semblance to the facts and it's a shame, as the true story of Emperor Commodus would make for an exciting film. In addition, at times I felt as if the dialog was just awful. Too often, folks talks as if they were making speeches or delivering lines in a high school play. And, it turns out I am not alone. After the film, I read through the IMDb trivia and noticed that the actors ALSO hated the dialog and much of it was changed....though in my opinion, not enough of it was changed. There was often no emotion other than rage or boredom from Maximus, for example. His grief at the crucifixion of his family sounded LESS emotional than it should have--like he was upset that the commissary forgot to but cheese on his burger--not like a man grief-stricken with loss. Simply put, the human side to the film is stilted.So what you are left with is a WILDLY exciting film--a true spectacle. But it lacks the humanity and truth that would have made it even better. Still, it's well worth seeing.","

"Gladiator","CherryBlossomBoy","22 October 2006","There is an unwritten rule in movie making that if you have an excellent script it doesn't matter how you film it. If you have a lousy script - then everything else matters, the direction, the cinematography, the acting, the music... ""Gladiator"" is an epitome of the latter half of that rule. The case where direction, music, acting and art direction completely redeemed a crappy story.For me it took watching it in German overdubbing. As I don't speak German there was nothing to detract me from visuals and music. And it's a new experience on another level. But more on that later. First the crappy part. The story.Make no mistake, whether you care about history or not, this is a horrible script. It's taking huge (and quite unacceptable) liberties with the period it purports to portray, it's unconvincing even on its own terms, the dialog is pretty much high school and in its core it's a predictable revenge story told a zillion times before. Apparently (according to a documentary about Hollywood screenwriters) only Russell Crowe didn't know what turd the script was so he contributed himself with the juvenile ""husband of the dead wife"" speech.Ridley Scott and his crew apparently knew what stinker they had to work with and did their best to defeat it with excellence in all areas and actually made two films in one.On the surface it's a revenge story. The hero, a favorite army general turned gladiator, seeks revenge against a young emperor, who had general's family killed during the tumultuous succession to the throne. The military battles and the gladiatorial bouts required for this aspect of the movie are done both to tremendous detail and on a grand scale. With the help of CGI they are seen in all their glory and gore. Some accuse Scott of shying away from action but his direction shows everything one needs to see. Yes, the cuts are brief, the camera sometimes doesn't follow through, but the editing is pure poetry and you miss nothing. Cinematography-wise every frame is shot in a way that you could just hang it on a wall as a nice picture. Costumes and scenery are impeccable. A revenge story, yes, but well worth watching.But on another level ""Gladiator"" plays out like a remake of ""Fall of a Roman Empire"". But it's not in the script. It's in the mood set again by production. This other story is about the decline and death of classical Rome and its ideals. There is simple yet effective symbolism to express it, the play on dark and light and the sunrise-sunset arc. The movie starts with a battle at dawn, the way the Rome itself had once dawned, fighting. There is an ideal Roman hero, valiant and dutiful, there's a typical Roman villain, clandestine and scheming. Hero does his best in the light, the villain does his worst in the dark, whenever they swap environments during the movie they fail miserably. The story ends at sunset, symbolizing the end of the Empire itself, and although an uplifting speech is given at that point it is defeated by the setting sun.The feeling of the doom is constantly emphasized by melancholic music. The dreamlike experience of the main character who is already dead but doesn't yet know it is enhanced when he finally visits Rome and the city is an idealistic, blown in proportions version of itself. The script may be a complete falsification of history, but the feeling of decline one gets when watching those scenes is probably completely faithful.So forget the story and the closing speech. Watch and listen the movie. The Roman Empire is living and dying once more before your very eyes.","

"Gladiator","cutter-12","29 March 2002","There is much to appreciate about about this picture but at the same time there is much to castigate as well. What could have been a thoroughly involving story turns out to be crippled by a lean script, some very indecisive direction and choppy editing. Not to mention some bad casting in the form of Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, a role which cries out to have been the last role played by Anthony Quinn.The film starts out well and looks bleakly authentic in its depiction of the pivotal battle in the wars between the barbarian tribes of Germania and the Roman Empire. But as the story gives way to 40 minutes of exposition following Commodus and Lucilla's introduction, Ridley Scott seems to tack things on whenever the script runs into weak spots. This leaves the film without a flowing narrative and it seems to want to please a mindless summer movie action market while at the same time aspiring to be something deeper. What it leaves us with is a schizophrenic, unequivocal story full of contradictions. There seems to be an epidemic in the past three or four years - films like this, Titanic, The Patriot, Pearl Harbor, Enemy at the Gates etc, try hard to be great epic films but at their core they are very slight and even trivial. The story in Gladiator holds promise but what little conflict there is set up and thrown at us in the first hour, leaving just a linear resolution to unfold for the remainder. A shame because so many elements could have been introduced in this story to make it truly an awesome and thoughtful epic. I guess complex stories like Spartacus and Ben-Hur will never be made again. This one falls somewhere short, though better than Demitrius and the Gladiators and the film it heavily borrows its narrative structure from - The fall of the Roman Empire.Technically the CGI is at times seamless and other times poor. When our troop of Gladiators run into the colosseum for the first time however the effect is absolutely jaw dropping and the scene that follows certainly delivers the action goods. The acting is very good throughout except for Tomas Arana as Quintus (about as bad as John Dall in Spartacus) and the aforementioned Richard Harris. Like Braveheart, not a bad entertainment experience but highly Hollywoodized and with an uneven narrative. But unlike Braveheart, the ending to Gladiator is a just a little embarrassing as it rips off both Braveheart and Titanic to far less effect. If you can get past the flaws, not the worst Roman spectacle on offer. Too highly rated at 8.1/10.","

"Gladiator","Gordon-38","21 June 2000","I absolutely love Ridley Scott.  ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" both rank among my favorite films.  ""Gladiator,"" though, just didn't work for me.Russell Crowe is a fantastic actor, and really ought to be a big, big, big star.  Unfortunately, he's not given much to do here.  He fights, he broods, he whines...but he's never really forced to stretch his talents.My main quibble, I suppose, is that the movie was clearly going for ""Braveheart"" effect, and it fails.  It was easy to get some sympathy going for Mel Gibson's character in ""Braveheart.""  He was fighting for freedom and justice.  Sadly for ""Gladiator,"" it's pretty hard to develop much sympathy for any particular faction within the Roman empire.  Where ""Braveheart"" was able to give us a few effective hallucinations and dream sequences, ""Gladiator"" shoves it down our throat with oddly-colored, tripping-on-acid dream sequences every five minutes.  Yes, we get the point.  He misses his family, and he'll see them in the afterlife.  Move on already!Apart from the dream sequences, the movie does look pretty spectacular.  The Colliseum is an impressive sight.  The costumes, for once in a sword-and-sandal epic, don't look like the costume department simply raided the bedding department at K-Mart.  And the fight scenes are, indeed, entertaining and visceral.In the end, though, the movie is less than the sum of its parts.","

"Gladiator","TheNabOwnzz","21 April 2019","Gladiator is not just director Ridley Scott's ultimate masterpiece ( And i am also keeping the fantastic Alien & Blade Runner in mind when i say this ), it is also undoubtedly one of the most viscerally effective and emotionally compelling of motion pictures ever made.It plays somewhat like a modern Ben-Hur, as a very respectable character is forced into slavery due to him standing up for what is right. Of course, being a much more modern epic, the editing is a lot quicker, as is the entire pace of the picture. However,with 171 minutes playtime in the extended edition, Scott doesn't haste through this picture, and takes his time to set up his characters & their respective arcs. Gladiator is however not a flawless film, as several action sequences ( Particularly in the introduction in the battle of Germania ) feature quite a lot of shaky cam and quick editing, but admittedly this is nowhere near as bad as something like Taken or The Bourne Trilogy. Most of the action sequences are superbly edited, with widescreen shots to create an overview, combined with mediums to immerse the viewer into the action. A couple of times there is a shakycam shot in the middle of this, but it's a very minor issue. Another minor fault is in some of the backdrops. The 'Am i not merciful' scene features an obvious greenscreen, saturated a bit too brightly, and Proximo is obviously not physically there near the end of the film ( When actor Oliver Reed had already died ). Again these minor issues feature only in 1 scene respectively, and therefore do not really do anything to truly diminish the cinematic power that Gladiator provides.On the whole, the cinematography & art direction of Gladiator is impeccable. It is not the best, since as stated before there are a couple of lesser backdrops easily recognizable as greenscreens, but for most of the picture the viewer is subjected to beautiful angles, backdrops & sets. The scenes in Zuccabar are an example of the seductive natural beauty Gladiator provides, and Maximus's ride to his family after his execution attempt also feature some stunning environmental shots. Sets are elegantly crafted and varied in a beautiful color palette, becoming most apparent in Commodus's & Lucilla's scenes. The titanic image of the Colosseum is also one that is difficult to get rid of, despite the fact that i believe it was filmed in full CGI, but apart from perhaps the absolute final shot ( Burying the sculptures ), that is hardly noticable.The art of acting is utilized at its finest in Gladiator, with three absolute superb performances by leads Russel Crowe as Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus & Connie Nielsen as Lucilla. Not to mention the fantastic supporting performances of legendary actor Richard Harris & Oliver Reed. Crowe is the epitome of a brick of stoic masculinity, yet he gave an utterly convincing and extended sob fest when gazing upon the sight of his crucified family, showing us his versatility as an actor. We see him win a battle against Germanians through his discipline, intelligence and courage, and we are rooting for his character from this moment forth. He is in his heart a simple man that just wants to go home to his family, but he is also honor bound to Rome, and proves this through his courageous actions. Not interested by the corruptions of power, he lives only to see justice done. Phoenix is superb as the corrupted emperor, showing us his envy of Maximus simply with one look into the eyes ( Look at Phoenix's superb facial acting in the scene where Maximus reveals himself to him in the arena ), his arrogance & his brutality. Nielsen is also quite underrated, as her disguised fear during every scene with her brother after their father's death is a stunning feat of acting within acting, culminating with her utter terror at the end when Commodus demands a 'pure blood' heir with her.Of course one cannot forget Hans Zimmer's fantastic contribution to his masterpiece, creating arguably his finest score to date, with this especially being the case during the transition between the (Again) 'Am i not merciful' scene and the shots of the arena. Obviously 'Now we are free' is also one of the most emotionally powerful scores ever created. It is also one of Zimmer's most varied scores, as a slight criticism of him is often his repeated melodies ( Admittedly, a lot of the themes in Gladiator still sound similar to The Rock, but a lot of them also do not ). In any case, it is rare to imagine the brilliance and emotional resonance of Gladiator without Zimmer's score.While the narrative is fairly straightforward as a revenge story, the dialogue written is superb, with many incredible lines such as 'What we do in life, echoes in eternity', not to mention the slow character development and character arcs, even within seemingly minor characters like Proximo & Quintus ( You will need to see the extended edition to witness Quintus's arc ) who have their original ideals challenged and overcome throughout the events in the film. Even though Maximus's sole purpose in life has become to kill Commodus in revenge for his family, it is in a way a very hopeful film. A film about standing up for what is right, and being granted redemption and a reunion with loved ones in the end. Maximus does not want to rule Rome, but in slaying Commodus, he secures the feature of it for is people, while also acquiring his personal goal. He demands respect for his valor and his morals throughout the film, and this makes sure that we as an audience are emotionally drained by the time he enters the Elysium fields, and is hailed as a hero by the people of Rome, and a hero he was.One of the all-time greats of epic motion pictures, Gladiator features impeccable acting, writing ,cinematography, art direction & a phenomenal original score. It also features possibly the most relatable main character ever written, which is partly why there are very little films that can equal the emotional power that Gladiator creates.","

"Gladiator","tedg","14 May 2000","Regular readers of my comments note my penchant for pointing out that film is a modern medium, meaning that films -- good ones anyway -- are often largely about themselves. When the nature of this self-comment is interesting, I point it out. But I failed to do so in an earlier comment on Gladiator, so here is the remedy.Summer movies target the lowest of our sensibilities. The plots are highly simplified morality plays where good and evil are radically drawn; the form is of violent spectacle. In other words, our civilized society wants the same things we observe in later Rome, to which we insist on feeling superior.So the master Scott gives us a violent spectacle about a violent spectacle. He makes fun of us by pandering to our baser tastes while slyly getting us to agree with the wise senator who observes how simple, stupid and manipulable is the mob. He did much the same in Blade Runner, but there the comment was on the sharpness, complexity of the audience not its dullness.
Is this a maturing cynicism, an adventure into a new challenge (mastering the art of painting with a blunt palette), or a striking out against Hollywood's financial politics? I suppose we've have to wait a decade to find out -- until after the power-hungry Caesars die and the medium is returned to the enlightened leaders of the people.","

However, I don't think I have ever seen a movie win so many awards without questioning the validity. Gladiator, while still a good film, is hardly deserving of all its accolades. I mean it might be worthy of winning cinematography or production awards or special effects but Best picture? Best Actor? I could think of a 100 other movies in the year 2000 more deserving than this movie. Don't misunderstand, I like this movie, but the problem is that movie awards like the Oscars,presumably, are there to honor high quality and High achievements in each respected field. Russel Crowe does an adequate job, but his acting in his other Oscar nominated films like ""The Informant"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"" were light years ahead of his performance in ""Gladiator"". Furthermore, Giving best picture to this film was mind boggling. I personally feel that the only reason this movie was even in the running at all, was because of the money it made. It was a good action movie and nothing more. Hey, remember that ""Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" was also up for best picture that year. In my opinion, It ran circles around ""Gladiator"". Wheras ""Gladiator' was just a good action film. CTHD was a phenomenal action movie and love story and should have won the top prize.","

I found the acting good, the spectacle and special effects outstanding, the hero one we could cheer for. Why, then, do I feel so empty? Was it all the hype, best picture of the year? I just don't know. It was totally predictable. There were absolutely no surprises. After seeing The Patriot and realizing both movies have the same plot, I expected something more. Why are evil Roman Emperors always portrayed as cowardly wimps? I still don't believe that he actually was willing to go into the arena with Maximus. He wouldn't have anything to do with war. There is the obligatory killing of the family. That goes back to Macbeth folks. If a ruler wants to stay a ruler, leave the family alone. I know it's just to show how evil and powerful the Emperor is, but do you want the top general in the army gunning for you?--this will guarantee it. There is masterful cinematography in this film. The scenes of violence are masterful. Although once you've seen one fountain of blood spouting up, you've seen them all--one decapitation is like another. What I wanted was to see the characters really dealing with the evil of the times and confronting it. There is always that army out there ready to be commanded again. There is always the possibility that the greatest empire in the world can be destroyed by one guy (like when Mel Gibson won the Revolutionary War all by himself). I think this is really quite a good film. But I don't see it as deserving to be named the best of any year. We've come to demand a movie that looks good rather than one that grasps our heart.","

"Gladiator","IcyTones","27 November 2020","A movie where the featured Black guy is 'NOT' the first to die. Djimon Hounsou who plays Juba is a rising star that has swapped his life as a Catwalk Model & appearing in music videos for an acting career. He has been acting since 1997.
Juba is 'The Spaniard's' confidant whilst both serve as slaves. Both were sold to the local entrepreneur to fight as Gladiators.That unmistakable scar & voice of Oliver Reed was a surprise to see as this movie was recommended to me for 'the chariot race' scene. Twas good to see a veteran actor in this movie. Oliver Reed was to acting what George Best was to football. I always think that whatever major or minor roles veteran actors play, their names should come up first in the credits, but sadly not everyone shares this view.Although it's not a competitive race, there is a small 'Chariot Race' in the Coliseum Arena, but it's a race to kill the band of Gladiators stuck in the middle, before they get a chance to kill the Emperors league of marauders - in the name of 'sport'.The Emperor's son didn't just 'decide' to kill his father, he had a heart felt emotional son-to-father talk with his dad, who responded equally with the same heartfelt emotions of a father who knelt before his son to kinda ask for his son's forgiveness. A father who now acknowledges that he is as much to blame for shaping Commodus's wayward character, is a moment to be treasured. It's the father who has failed his son, not the son who has disappointed his father. The Emperor extended his arms to give his son a hug, but his son Commodus overcome with grief and jealousy at hearing the news that his father's general has been appointed by his father to temporarily rule Rome, he took the opportunity of an embrace to suffocate & kill his father and declare himself the new Emperor.If you lack the courage to be yourself, this movie can only but encourage you. In today's society education is a supportive aid to have a title & letters after your name. When asked to reveal himself, Maximus gave this whole spiel of who he was. Who are you? What goes before you? How do you want to introduce or refer to yourself? These were my thoughts!","

(Commodus was actually strangled in his bath when poison wasn't killing him fast enough.) The sister of Commedus, Lucilla (who had actually been executed at the beginning of Commedus' reign) announces that we are all going to honor Maximus and restore the Republic.For a Roman history buff, this is like saying World War II was Hitler giving us all Ice Cream.What actually happened was that after Commedus (who wasn't that bad of a guy, really) Rome went into an embarrassing period known as the ""Year of the Five Emperors, where a decent man was assassinated, the office of emperor was auctioned off, and three rival generals launched a civil war.This is universally agreed to be the tipping point of Rome's inevitable decline.","

"Gladiator","tedg","7 May 2000","Two things about this film intrigue me: the novel integrated talents of Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe.We are creatures who depend on idea fragments in everything we do. Virtually everything is a rehash, sometimes creative but mostly not. When someone or something comes along and adds to the vocabulary, something essentially new, it is a big deal -- that's my definition of genius. Today, a major force in defining our basic vocabulary is cinema, the visual element of filmaking. But all the easy stuff has been done as we leave the first generations of the art.So when someone comes along who can conceive a world that is new and unfamiliar, and who can actually deliver the illusion of being in that world, it is notable. Scott does that here (and in Blade Runner). Kubrick did it once or maybe twice; Polanski had the skills when he had an edge, but this is exceedingly rare. Note here how little quoting Scott does of prior battle in his battle scene, how Ben Hur (and all the lesser period pieces) are not at all referenced. How new this all is. (The only concession is the annoying British accent of the Romans.)What is remarkable is that it is all visual. It is not in the writing, the effects per se, or the acting, though they are all good enough. I intend to see this film several more times for just the visual experience. I suspect that because of the coherence and advance of the visual vocabulary. this will be seen as a landmark film long after Private Ryan and Titanic become footnotes.But there is also Crowe, and there's something notable here. I don't see great acting in the normal sense, but there is something else, and this seems new to me as well. To check this, I reviewed LA Confidential and The Insider. Crowe has the ability to develop tension, a normal enough skill, but he also has the ability to project this tension into the environment of the film. Watch how the scenes flow as his acting in one scene is tossed into another; it's remarkable.When he did this in The Insider, he seems to use as his resonator the unwitting, ever-bombastic Pacino. Here, He uses the similar exaggerated scope of the story, both the setting and the violence of the context.WARNING! Spoilers follow:Both Scott and Crowe seem to know what they are doing. So they have eliminated many of the elements normally required: there is no backstory, no explanation of what went before, no comic relief, just the barest of scaffolding. But in that, it is made of huge, strong girders. In another film, we'll have revenge driven by the death of the Hero's wife. Here, she and their child are gang-raped, burned until nearly dead, then crucified. In another film, the bad guy is conventionally bad, but here we have patricide and incestual rape. In another period film, we'd have lots of street scenes (which are cheap) to convey a sense of place: not so here. Nothing not essential to the core projection and resonant backdrop are used. So instead of parading the effects (as with Titanic or Jurassic Park), they are handled casually, incidentally as background. Just a huge visual sweep through which tension is passed. It is early to know, but this could be one of the great films.","

"Gladiator","john-collie-1","9 July 2023","In an age where CGI often overshadows storytelling, Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000) is a breath of fresh cinematic air. This historical epic, set in a tumultuous era of the Roman Empire, is a masterclass in filmmaking, showcasing an amalgamation of riveting performances, stunning visuals, and a score that stirs the soul.At the heart of Gladiator is Maximus Decimus Meridius, played with steely determination and compelling vulnerability by Russell Crowe. Crowe's performance is a spectacular tour de force, embodying a man whose honor, family, and freedom are taken from him. The depth of his character arc - from respected Roman general to enslaved gladiator, from broken man to symbol of hope - is beautifully depicted, earning Crowe a well-deserved Oscar.Opposite Crowe is Joaquin Phoenix as the power-hungry, emotionally unstable Emperor Commodus. Phoenix masterfully portrays a character that we love to hate, providing a worthy adversary for Crowe's Maximus. The scenes between the two are electric, the tension palpable.Visually, Gladiator is a spectacle to behold. The depiction of ancient Rome, from its grand coliseums to its war-torn battlefields, is rendered with incredible detail and authenticity. The gladiatorial combats are raw and thrilling, capturing the brutality and excitement of the Roman games. Scott doesn't shy away from the violence, but rather uses it to underline the brutality of the era and the courage of those who dared to defy it.Yet, it is the film's memorable score by Hans Zimmer that elevates Gladiator to an exceptional cinematic experience. From the melancholic ""Now We Are Free"" to the stirring ""Battle,"" Zimmer's soundtrack resonates, amplifying the emotion and gravitas of the narrative.The screenplay, too, deserves praise. Packed with memorable lines - ""What we do in life echoes in eternity,"" - it's a script that complements the grandeur of the film's visuals and performances.Gladiator is more than a movie; it's an experience. A return to the golden age of epic filmmaking, it provides an emotional depth often lacking in blockbuster fare. It's a tale of vengeance and redemption, of the struggle against tyranny, and of the resilience of the human spirit. Two decades on, its impact remains undiminished, solidifying its position as one of the most compelling films of the 21st century.","

"Gladiator","tieman64","26 February 2012","""Father, I would have butchered the whole world...if you would only love me."" - Commodus Ridley Scott directs ""Gladiator"". The film's influenced by Cecil B. DeMille's epics (""The Crusades"", ""The Sign of the Cross""), and Italian/Hollywood sword-and-sandal movies (""Spartacus"", ""Ben Hur"", ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"", ""El Cid"", ""Barabbas"", ""Demetrius and the Gladiators"" etc), all films Scott adored as a child. As with Scott's other historical epics (""Conquest of Paradise"", ""Robin Hood"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven""), artwork and paintings the director came across as an art student seem to be a big influence, in this case the works of Jean-Leon Gerome (Scott's acknowledged Gerome's ""Pollice Verso"" as the reason he decided to direct ""Gladiator""), 19th century Orientalists, Charles Gleyre, Caravaggio and Delaroche.Of course the chief pleasure of any Scott movie is his emulation of famous painters and/or print artists. Think ""Blade Runner's"" nods to Edward Hopper, Enki Bilal and Jean Giraud (Moebius), ""Alien's"" reliance on Giger's ""Necronomicon"", and ""The Duellist's"" nods to Caspar David Friedrich and Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon's"", another painterly film, though Kubrick subverts the idyllic charms of Gainsborough and Watteau, whereas Scott goes for straight Romanticism (his final shot's a direct copy of Friedrich's ""Wanderer above the Sea of Fog""). The problem, though, is that Scott's images can never touch any of these other artists. Worse still, they're always aligned to silly screenplays.""Gladiator"" stars Russell Crowe as Maximus, the Roman general asked by the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius to take over as ruler of Rome. Before he is granted power, however, the emperor's tyrannical son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix, playing Commodus with severe daddy issues), orders the execution of Maximus and his family. Maximus survives, and embarks on a quest for vengeance. The film watches as Maximus falls from general to slave, rises from slave to gladiator and finally from gladiator to brave warrior who dares defy an emperor. The film ends with Maximus given a messianic, ""Braveheart""/""Spartacus"" inspired slow death.Great visuals and sequences are scattered about, but Scott's CGI lacks the gravity of even the FX work DeMille did a century earlier, the film is surprisingly stiff for an ""action epic"", ""Gladiator's"" adherence to old Hollywood storytelling, spectacle and violence makes it an immediately dated affair and Scott's dialogue reads like a bad stage-play (""Sometimes I do what I want to do, the rest of the time I do what I have to""), devoid of depth, nuance or wit. The film's overall tone is a cross between a WWF wrestling match and a perfume commercial, Scott dressing things up in a New Age score, gauzy filters, long focal lenses, ubiquitous smoke, flares and mist. It's ""Braveheart"" with less camp value. Like DeMille, what you mostly marvel at is the sheer scale of the production, though in our era of excess, such logistics have lost much of their weight.Hollywood isn't known for treating history seriously, but ""Gladiator"" is funny in the way it bulldozes yesteryear. The film ends with the fictional Maximus killing the real Emperor Commodus in gladiatorial combat, a mano-a-mano scenario that's the equivalent of Indiana Jones killing Hitler in a game of ping pong. Lucilla, the sister of Commodus (who had actually been executed at the beginning of Commodus' reign), then announces that Rome will ""honor Maximus"" by ""reversing Commodus' despotism"" and ""restoring the greatness of the Republic"". What the hell? The film somehow manages to turn Maximus' death (lots of Christian and crucification iconography) into a ""hero dying for the sins of Rome"" narrative, Maximus' death steering a resurrected Rome away from corruption and toward its supposedly saintly, Republican origins (historically, it was when Rome became a Republic that it turned into a psycho-expanding Empire, and it was as a Republic, and not while under dictatorial rule, that she was at her most bloody). You saw the same thing years ago with British Imperial nostalgia, Britain romanticising its colonial achievements and declaring them a proper source of pride, and today in the US with desires for ""strict constitutionalists"" and a return to those ""good old days"". You know, when you could own a slave and scalp Injuns. So by the film's end, ""Gladiator"" has turned the historical fall of the Roman Empire into Rome's ""purification"" and ""rebirth"" via the ""true warrior son"" of a ""departed Emperor"" ""nobly returning"" and replacing a ""bad, fake, fascist Emperor"". Cue psycho-expansionist George Bush Jr's coincidental ascension to the throne the same year Scott's film was released. It's what daddy wanted.End result: a violent Hollywood spectacle about the violent spectacle of gladiatorial combat, which makes fun of art which panders to the mob, whilst nevertheless glorifying violence, ""glory"", ""honor"" and the prosperity of Roman Imperialism. Note the way the simple, bare-bones existence of Maximus (the guy literally rallies his troops by stressing his love for simple, subsidence farming) is contrasted with Commodus' extravagance. Commodus may prove that the dumb masses only enjoy bread and circus antics, but Maximus trumps this by gaining support through the universal love for the simple, martial virtues that supposedly made Rome great. These virtues were more heroically illustrated by the Germanic fighters and Celtic tribes (ironic: ""Gladiator"" catapulted Celtic singer Enya to super-stardom), quickly slaughtered by Scott, who were defending themselves against Rome at the beginning of the film. 7.5/10 - Worth two viewings. See 1964's ""Becket"" and 1968's ""The Lion In Winter"".","

"Gladiator","sonofhades","7 June 2001","If you know ANYTHING about the history of Rome, please do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie.Lets see: Film opening sequence. General Maximus speaks such nonsense about troops, casualties etc. The massive battle in the movie would have been fine if they didn't have archers or catapults in the scene. After that, they should have used the scene in ""braveheart"", instead of a film about Romans.Remember that Roman army didn't charge into combat without controlled formations? Not considering this fact, the battle is the BEST part of the film. After this incident, the plot of the movie is sooooo predictable, as if the manuscript had been written by someone with the imagination of 12 year old child.Actors then...I have only seen worse acting performed by mr. Sylvester Stallone than the Aussie playing the role of Maximus. Even a wooden log could have put more feeling into the scene when he finds his family slaughtered. Besides, he rode a huge journey in one day, came to the smoking ruins of his villa from a distance of 1000 klicks (try that yourself).And the final scene: Emperor challenging a gladiator into a duel, how stupid is that? This movie has the same value as a historical movie as Rambo III.","

"Gladiator","mjneu59","22 November 2010","Ridley Scott's Oscar-winning ersatz epic is one of the least spectacular big-screen spectacles ever sold to an undemanding public: a sand-and-sandal throwback stripped of the genre's all too necessary guilty pleasures. The idea was to recreate for today's digital generation a wide-screen Roman Empire costume drama from Hollywood's pre-video adolescence, but all the fancy computer imagery (and state-of-the-art budget) only makes the new film look and sound more solemn and pompous than its beefcake role models. Worse yet, the occasional token nod toward old-fashioned visual grandeur isn't enough to camouflage the claustrophobic TV screen compositions and typically frantic Madison Avenue editing job (designed, perhaps, to hide the digital wrinkles).Russell Crowe is the title character: a Roman general fallen from imperial favor, battling for his life and honor on the floor of the Coliseum, where the prize for victory is another day of slavery and the cost of defeat is a mercifully quick death. Crowe's protagonist is a man of few words, most of them delivered in a flat monotone, matching the equally colorless photography, shaded in picturesque hues of misty gray and mud brown sepia.Don't expect any surprises from the strictly formula riches-to-rags-to-rebel hero scenario, which doesn't even allow the villains (degenerate emperor Joaquin Phoenix and his sister/lover Connie Nielson) a chance to have any fun. Audiences (and too many critics, who should have known better) conditioned by habit to reject anything original made the film a worldwide hit, but even in our current age of diminished expectations it should have been clear that they don't make 'em like they used to anymore.","

"Gladiator","chrisbrown6453","8 June 2001","Gladiator is a truly great depiction of an important part of early Roman Empire. Yes, Gladiator will probably win the Oscar of Best Picture of 2000, but should it?  While I agree that watching it was a great pleasure, I am not convinced that it was the best movie made last year.  In any other year, not containing a film named Cast Away', Gladiator would get my absolute vote, however in the interest of keeping this review to the movie at hand, I will not name which one I feel should win.Viewing Gladiator was definitely a spectacle everyone should endure. It has everything any good movie should; an original story, great acting, and truly awe-inspiring direction.  To be transported to a world that existed over 1800 years ago, and experience the very same excitement the Romans were able to enjoy is just incredible.  Ridley Scott struck did very well with his direction of Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Neilsen, and Oliver Reed (who unfortunately suffered a fatal heart attack during filming).  Scotts' ability to `see' the action in his head, and create the effect for the cameras is wonderful.  This is a far different epic than Alien', and far better than Hannibal'. 
Russell Crowe is fabulous as Maximus Meridius, the great soldier planning to return to his home after fighting his last battle only to find himself thrust between the dead kings will for him to become the new king, and Commudus, the son of the former king wanting him to stay and fight for him. Crowe is perfect in this role, he is strong, rugged looking, and has become quite a good actor since his days in The Quick and the Dead' and the awful Virtuosity'.Joaquin Phoenix is magnificent in his role as Commudus.   Only recently have I noticed what great acting skills Phoenix possesses, and how well he transforms into such diverse characters, such the same can be said of Ewan McGregor and his diverse roles in Trainspotting', Little Voice' and Star Wars: Episode I'.  Phoenix's ability to present himself in such a devious and hateful aspect is awe-inspiring.  As the sister of Commudus, Lucilla (Connie Neilsen) has to play both devoted to her brother, and sympathetic to Maximus.  Neilsen pulls this off beautifully and she is very convincing in her role.The story is beautifully written, and there is never a dull moment.  After I viewed the film for the first time I felt that the gladiator fight scenes were too far apart, and not enough of them were in the movie.  However, a very good friend of mine, we shall call him Michael DeZubiria (check out his reviews), felt it necessary to explain to me that Gladiator is not just a story about fighting, but a story about the life struggles of one man and his quest to avenge the brutal killing of his family. 
Now, while I admit that I liked this film, I am not ready, nor will I ever be ready, to call it the best movie of 2000 (see my Cast Away review).  I do not want to take anything away from Gladiator, it's just that there was a more original, creative film in 2000.","

"Gladiator","Krippler","13 December 2004","There's really nothing spectacular about ""Gladiator"". The acting is stiff because of the boring and sometimes non-sensible script. Ridley Scott's direction is choppy and forced. It reminded me more of one of his brother's movies. I love Russell Crowe but the fact that he won Best Actor for this and not for ""The Insider"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"" just doesn't make sense. To me he just seems bored in some scenes. I wonder if the Oscar voters watched any of the other films from that year because this sure wasn't better than ""Traffic"". Of the 2 and a half hours running time, there are really only 30-40 minutes of excitement. The rest is average at best and the ending is just ridiculous. THIS IS NOT A CLASSIC. ""Gladiator"" is a good film but does not deserve the praise that it is given by most on this site. I give it a 6 now but my opinion for this film drops every time I watch it.","

"Gladiator","PyroSikTh","30 August 2021","Gladiator deserves every ounce of praise it got at the time (and debatably deserved more), and still gets to this day. It's a stirring story of revenge against the backdrop of Roman glory, with a game played off between the stoicism of Maximus against the cruel envy of Commodus over the people's adoration. It becomes as much about the back-alley politicking and public perceptions as it does the fights within the arena itself. Maximus is the pinnacle of masculinity and heroism against Commodus' despicable antagonist, an underdog against powers greater than himself. And when Maximus gets his revenge and collapses on the floor to meet his wife and son in the afterlife, it hits with the emotional weight it has earned. It's beautiful to look at, gorgeous to listen to, expertly directed and edited. I give Gladiator a resounding 9/10.","

I agree that the visual effects are amazing, but the score is not a masterpiece and the most important thing-in my idea-the screenplay is too ordinary and has nothing particular and new to present. It seems that the real point of killing Maximus is to make audiences cry.( I couldn't find any other reason to get him killed). But, in some ways the movie is worth watching.

"Gladiator","alice liddell","16 May 2000","There is a lovely film in here about a spoilt brat teenager who unfortunately has tyrannical rule over the Roman Empire.  So whereas most sulky boys kick tables and storm off to their room, Commodus Caesar gets to throw those who annoy and humiliate him to digitally enhanced cats. Joaquin Phoenix gives a magnificent performance, camp in the best swords and sandals tradition, throwing childish fits when he doesn't get his way, sporting marvellously gothic eyeliner (Romans vs Goths, you see), scheming elaborate punishments for his big sister, which, for him, unlike the rest of us, who get our hair pulled, can actually, horribly, be realised.It's also nice to see that the hackneyed tide of postmodernism has been stemmed Canute-like, and a complex period in Roman history, with its plagues, revolts, tyrannies and back-room intrigues and murders can be 'crystallised' in a young boy's feeling unloved by his father.  Haven't we all felt this melancholy burden at one time or another, the failure to do what is right, honourable and Stoic, when ambition and privilege seem much more immediately rewarding?Add to this the accursed, tragic flaws of incest and worse (the difference between mad tyrant and noble hero must always be expressed in terms of neurotic sexuality and fertility-turned-ascetic renunciation), and you have a truly harassed, 'modern' hero, well supported by a ripe mixture of theatrical greats (Derek Jacobi) and former 60s icons (Oliver Reed, David Hemmings - is this Scott's THE LIMEY?).  He gets to watch some champion gladiating too.Of course, a film of this stature, size and scope must inevitably have its longueurs, here an elaborate sub-plot involving Russell Crowe, an inexorable melange of MAD MAX/BRAVEHEART (noble hero turned insane revenger after wife and family slaughtered; the bleak landscapes witnessing vastly scaled pub brawls; the lengthy, dimly lit, self-agonising indoor scenes, as a 'man' debates within himself his 'man'liness and duty; the loaded dichotomy between caricatured, vicious Imperials and unswervingly decent warrior; buddy-buddy development; Godardian, alienating, swelling score) and SPARTACUS (the violent gladiator scenes; the chinned sincerity; the captive peasant taking on the might of the Roman Empire; the structural homophobia).Crowe is a revelation - and reveals a hitherto unmined talent for comedy and parody.  Of course, this works because, like Leslie Nielsen, he marshalls a tautly disciplined straight face, but his clenched surliness, his Heston-like intergrity, his attempt to absorb the Stoic precepts of Marcus Aurelius (his scenes with Richard Harris are worthy of that masterpiece oof classical epics, CARRY ON CLEO), his reciting dialogue Abrahams-Zucker-Abrahams would have been proud to have written, are so funny (the scene where he rises off the ground of the auditorium to 'meet' his family is pure comic genius), so expertly pomposity-bursting, so winding up the pretensions of an entire genre, I emerged from the film with great respect for this stunningly versatile, deceptive actor.He couldn't have done it, though, without the help of Ridley Scott, essaying another mass culture in decline, who has bravely exorcised the complexities, ambiguities and enigmas of BLADE RUNNER to create an admirably simplistic epic, to abandon the weight of historical validity in favour of Boys' Own fantasy.  It would have been easy with this budget to create a teeming, living, authentic Rome, but Scott the postmodernist recognises the impossibility of this project, and, in an act of avant-garde innovation, hangs his drama on a handful of geometric signifiers, with little relation to any reality beyond the drawing board.There has been an extraordinary , and for me higly promising, strain in modern Hollywood filmmaking (eg TITANIC, THE PHANTOM MENACE), in which the new digital technology is not used to create novel, vast, convincing, strange worlds, but to elucidate the principles of Brechtian epic theatre, to foreground artificiality, implausibility, soullessness, encouraging the audience out of the narrative, to stand back and reflect on issues such as the construction of history, mass spectacle etc.  The dreams of the New Wave may finally have come to fruition.Like most films of this type, GLADIATOR is about a hero who is too good for his society, who cannot live in it.  But is he?  The absence of historical verity in the story set me thinking to about what Scott was trying to say. Because the film is a story about a man who lets his family die, who isn't there for them.  This is a curious hero to celebrate, though appropriate in an age where fathers often abandon their families, even to the extent of not paying alimony.  After Maximus (Scott must have been a Monty Python fan) sees the charred crucified bodies, the film goes momentarily into dream mode.  But does it ever come out of it?  This is a story that is full of doubles, strange correspondances, mirror scenes; it thoroughly interrogates the nature of family, and finally reaches a ritual climax in which both sides of the same coin (sons) wipe each other out, like Gothic doppelgangers.  Is the whole film Maximus's guilty dream, about guilt, emasculation, eternal torture over failure, the descent into bestiality? Is it a theme of America's guilt over slavery and subsequent race traumas, or a renunciation of them (both whites and blacks are slaves here).  Whatever. This is the first great comedy of the millennium.","

His despair over the death of his family and the future he's denied, his disgust over the games, and his quest for vengeance when he finds the man who killed his family and his close friend.Joaquin Phoenix also does a marvelous job for Commodus. Successfully showing him as a spoiled rich boy lusting for more power, and viewing his as someone not to be feared, but pitied.Even though Oliver Reed died before he could shoot some very important scenes, they flawlessly brought him back from the dead digitally to say his final words, ""Shadows and Dust,"" from a test shoot earlier making the approach of the climax even more gripping.Alien, Blade Runner, and now Gladiator.

"Gladiator","cjswan","16 May 2000","Germania, 150 AD, the setting of Gladiator's opening scene. Far from the blazing sun and dazzlingly beauty of ancient Rome, Ridley Scott shoots the opening sequence in a subdued light. The Roman legions are nonetheless impeccably turned out as they face the comparatively disorganised rabble that inhabits this miserable environment. Caesar's soldiers seem somewhat misplaced here. However, Russell Crowe is at home in this environment of knee-deep mud and merciless snow. He commands the screen with all the virtues of his motto: Strength and Honour.'The plot, with its hero-to-zero-to-hero nature, runs through Gladiator's every vein. As General Maximus, Russell Crowe is welcomed by Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Richard Harris) to take the Roman throne as Emperor of a new Republic. All does not run smoothly however as mislead heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) takes over Rome with ill-gotten domination, having dispatched his own Father. Maximus is cast out to find his family murdered and his Spanish farm burnt to the ground. Taken in as a slave by Proximo (Reed), Maximus becomes a Gladiator and starts his journey to the Coliseum and revenge against Commodus.Scott's cast is powerful and he is not left wanting as powerful performances are delivered by all. Due to his untimely mid-production death, Oliver Reed is created in some scenes by the grace of computer graphics, which are as convincing as they come; sometimes making it difficult to differentiate between Reed himself and his computerised counterpart.
It is, however, the supporting actors who create many of Gladiator's best dialogue-based scenes. In an accomplished demonstration of her acting ability as Lucilla, Connie Nielsen saves the occasional scene as Joaquim Phoenix shows us that he can do evil', but is less convincing when it comes to the more emotional qualities of his role.As a vehicle for the plot, Scott's beautifully created and highly symbolic (there is an image of fire in nearly every shot of the film) dialogue scenes are of a certain merit with digitally created backgrounds that encompass the meticulous nature of the Roman Empire. However, dialogue alone does not an epic movie make, and it is in the film's spectacular action sequences that Gladiator come into its own. Shot on location in Malta, Scott's first arena was built by an army of locals and commanded some 5000 extras (a large majority of whom were of a cardboard variety). All of this pales in comparison as we arrive in a digitally created Rome which makes some scenes in Ben Hur some somewhat small scale. The Coliseum is immense, both inside and out, and the computerised provides the electric atmosphere in which Crowe and his feline companions (four sizeable, and real, Bengal tigers) perform.The battle sequences are perfectly choreographed and shot as iconic masks and typically Roman chariots are abundant in their power and imagery. As swords clash and heads roll, Ridley Scott is triumphant in the application of special effects technology and his directorial prowess.Always one to embrace technology, Scott's views over Rome's landscape are reminiscent of the beautifully created cityscape of Blade Runner. This is a film that fears so little and boasts so much, even a lady archer being sliced clean in half by a spiked chariot wheel!All those involved with Gladiator should be delighted and confident with their creation, for indeed this is a convincing and enthralling display with epic proportions to take the wind from James Cameron's titanic sails.","

Like the little Lucius, this movie will likely make you to dream of being a gladiator.Second time - in your 30's for the love, life choices and loses. This is the time when you fight all your battles for yourself and your family. Like Maximus you will dream to get out of your Colosseum and break the chains.Third time - when you feel your life is close to an end - just to remember what you have achieved. Like the old emperor Marcus Aurelius you will have to realize if your name would be remembered or forgotten forever. Is your family close to you in your final hours or you are going to see them in the afterlife. Have you been a good parent?I really enjoy this movie every time I watch it.","

"Gladiator","cxw1065","18 May 2000","I am usually worried that I'm in for a big let-down when I am looking forward to a film as much as I was to this one.  This time however, I was very pleasantly suprised, when Gladiator not only fulfilled but surpassed my expectations.  It's a brilliant film, which (while containing weaknesses such as a script which wasn't quite as good as it could have been, and one climactic scene which completely changes, and ruins, the ending) manages to engage your heart and mind.The performances are without exception excellent (although the accents may distract a bit, there is such a wide variety of them).  I must single out for commendation Mr. Phoenix, who despite his youth manages to portray a character with such conviction that you never for a moment doubt his interpretation.  His physical performance is as good as his mental one.The film rests firmly on the (extremely attractive and capable) shoulders of one Russell Crowe.  In a tour-de-force performance, he manages to convey a man (not a superhuman) with frailties and doubts and fears and heart.  I cannot convey to you how brilliant this man's performance was.  If anyone else had been this character, the film would have rated at best a five out of ten.Kudos to Russell Crowe, and to Ridley Scott, for managing to keep this film on a level with humanity, rather than one in which the characters become killing machines.A must see, five stars out of five.","

"Gladiator","viggodahlin","9 August 2021","There is no denying it. Phoenix in all of his movies he delivers. He commits perfectly to the role he plays and in playing the character Commudus he truly shows, that it doesn't matter if he's the villain or the hero.The story in this film is quite dark if you think about it. The greatest general of Rome, Maximus continues to obliterate the enemy in his scope with extreme audacity. Although, later on we are introduced to his displeasure battling in the war and his longing to his family at home. The Caesar tells Maximus that he wants him to take over as the new Caesar after he dies. Maximus does not want the throne and so on he refuses to accept the honorful request from the Caesar.As soon as Caesar tells Commudus that instead of him, the true Caesar, Caesar wants Maximus to take the throne, it all goes to hell. Maximus gets the worst punishment possible (his family gets burned alive and he has to submit to being a slave). And after all this he still manages to rise in the ranks and ultimately overthrow the throne from winning the crowd and killing Commodus.But it wasn't this simple of a story for me, at least for the character Commodus. Commodus, he's envious, greedy, sad and a very lonely soul. From the very start we see how his own father completely and utterly humiliate him in front of the whole soldier army, and indirectly chooses the general as a ""better"" son. But he keeps his head up, he knows that he will still be the next ruler of Rome and to marry his own sister. But this plan becomes a lot more difficult when his father comes to him to say that he will pick the general as the next Caesar and not him, and that ""Your mistakes as a son, is only my mistakes as a father."" Hearing all this, he puts up a beautiful speech and then hugs his father to at last say, goodbye...Commodus kills his father and then later on picks himself to be the next Caesar as it wasn't official of his father's choice. Maximus's family dies and he gets hunted to be killed so no complications can arise. Everything works out as he wanted but nothing is what he dreamed of. The crowd of the colosseum and entire Rom boos him and want him gone. The senate isn't either to pleased about his arrival but of course one narcissistic guy enjoys his upcoming. Commodus is quickly tired of the senate and want him and his sister only to exist in this purified world. He caresses her often and eventually tries to kiss her but she in no way feels the same, she is terrified of him and hates him.Commodus doesn't care and forces her to be with him or he will kill her son. Later we see him watching the gladiator games and a particular someone getting extra attention. He goes down to see who it is and yes, it's Maximus. He tells Maximus to drop his weapon if i recall correctly, and after a short solid pause Maximus doesn't follow his orders, the CAESAR's orders. The crowd loves it and Commodus obviously can't kill Maximus in front of the crowd, then it would be impossible to get the crowd back. A little input from myself is that, this is where Commodus realizes that it truly does not matter which position he is in or Maximus for that matter, it all stays the same.After a few events unravel, Commodus faces Maximus in a 1v1 sword fight. Both lose their sword after a while but Commodus has a knife up his sleeve and tries to stab Maximus but the reverse happens and Commodus tries punching Maximus several times in his arms with nothing happening. Maximus ends it and Rome is saved.A very fine storytelling indeed. The reason as to why i focused much more on Commodus is because he is certainly more sympathetic and interesting. He truly never understood love or life in that matter. His goals were always deceitful, malevolent and greedy. He never received even an ounce of love in his entire life and all he ever wanted was for his father and for his sister to love him. He never deeply wanted anything more than that. It's heartbreaking and the acting that Phoenix applies to this intricate and lonely soul is absolutely astounding and just beautiful. My words can't merely express enough how great of an act Phoenix puts on.8.5/10.","

The characters are quite as flat as they are on Star Wars 1 2 and 3. Even cinematography makes you squirm. Zoom in on a actor while he is monologuing? That hasn't been done since the 70ties and was dealt with there and than. Both Ben Hur and Spartacus were done over 40 years ago and were more convincing and better acted.

"Gladiator","marcin_kukuczka","18 June 2006","They were just shadows and dust. Yet, their courageous deeds have been admired for hundreds of years. Their name was ... gladiators.Since 1959 and the release of the ultra popular Roman epic BEN HUR, many people have thought that William Wyler's movie reached the ultimate splendor on screen and no other production may take its stead. However, the memorable year 2000 sees a premiere of GLADIATOR by Ridley Scott. The movie's title does not indicate any novel nor any specific period of Roman history. Yet, the film becomes one of the top Hollywood productions. What is so extraordinary about it that GLADIATOR is admired not only by epic fans but by the audiences of different interests, different preferences, different expectations from a movie.First of all, GLADIATOR, unlike many other epics, shows a very realistic image of the Roman Empire and makes a perfect use of this on screen. In this case, the movie which discusses a very distant period in time (2nd century A.D.) occurs to be clearly interpreted and understood by the 21 century-audience. This fact proves a great talent of the director, Ridley Scott, who exactly knows viewers' expectations. Such a movie is more a spectacle and entertainment than pure history. Therefore, even if there are historic figures in the film, we cannot treat it as history and look for historical accuracy or inaccuracy. It is much more since it generally shows Rome, its power, its emperors, its people, its games, finally...its gladiators.It seems quite unnecessary to present the content of the film while hundreds have done this before me. What I want to concentrate on GLADIATOR's universal aspect, which makes it an exceptional epic. As a matter of fact, no one will fully understand the story of Maximus (Russell Crowe) without profound reflections. Simply, the entire content of GLADIATOR is one great symbol. A simple man, a farmer becomes a great leader, emperor's friend. Yet, when times change, he gets through a personal tragedy becoming a slave, a gladiator whose primary task is to amuse people and the corrupted emperor by killing. Nevertheless, it is him who is honored at his death - He was the one who loved Rome. In my opinion, the very first shot of the movie shows it all - where Maximus heart is - a bird symbolizing gentleness, and fields symbolizing his life. The final fight on arena between emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and Maximus cannot be treated historically. It is a symbolic battle between two visions of Rome (using modern language - between two visions of the world) - the one of honor, equality and love and the one of decadence, slavery and corruption. And this is, I think, the most important message of this movie. In this perspective, the movie develops all characters universally.CAST: Russell Crowe, who portrays Maximus, does a very fine job. He portrays a man of a good heart who is exposed to living in the reality that is against all he heads for, a leader who got a new name, ""gladiator"". I loved his performance in one scene more than in any other - in the conversation with the emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Wonderful meeting of two seeing one goal - goodness of Rome! Joaquin Phoenix is also very memorable as brute Commodus, a corrupted emperor who is, on the one hand, a blood sucker, but, on the other hand, a man who wants to be loved. I also loved the performance of Connie Nielsen as Lucilla. This beautiful Danish actress very well fits to this role portraying a woman who lives in the very ambiguous reality. A note must also be made of Derek Jacobi, unforgettable Claudius from a perfect BBC series made almost 30 years earlier. Yet, two performances by already late actors are a must to mention, Richard Harris's phenomenal portrayal of Marcus Aurelius and Oliver Reed's slave trader Proximo. Oliver Reed died during filming and his death is a terrible loss to all film industry. We thank him for such a powerful performance in this film, unforgettable, forever in our hearts and minds.Some people say that GLADIATOR is too violent. I admit that there are very brutal moments, especially the ones showing arena fights. Nevertheless, that is what these fights looked like. Visual effects of the movie are so stunning that I was lost in admiration. Commodus's triumphant entrance to Rome (a bit exaggerated in size but representing not that much a city but rather its power), the sequence at Zucchabar, a fictional Roman province set in Mauretania Caesariensis, the imperial palace, the brutal battle in the woods of Germania - all is filled with unforgettable grandeur! The locations at Morocco, Malta, Italy and Spain add a thrill to the spectacle.And the music... it is half of the whole entertainment to watch GLADIATOR without the admiration of its excellent musical pieces. It is a flow from sentimentalism, through exotic sounds to the tunes expressing the gore of the arena. I loved the title song, it touched my heart. There is something like a gentle power in it...GLADIATOR is in many aspects a film that will become a cult movie, not only an ancient epic but a masterpiece of movie art. When I was a boy, I was saddened by the fact that I don't live in such times like the 1950s when great masterpieces were released like BEN HUR, QUO VADIS or THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. Yet, GLADIATOR made my dream come true. We all do live in such times, the times of great movies and this is, without doubt, one of such films. 10/10! They were just shadows and dust. However, who among them would predict that they would once (in almost 2000 years) be the characters of such a film masterpiece. So were only the emperors immortal?","

"Gladiator","LeonLouisRicci","5 May 2017","The New Millennium Begins with this ""Time Machine"" Movie that was and has become one of the most Popular, Award Winning Films in Recent History.History is Tweaked by the Journey, 2,000 Years Ago, when Rome was Kicking Ass and Decadent as the Fall of the Empire was Beginning.A Central Theme in Ridley Scott's Blockbuster is Rome's Politics, Corruption and Direction for the Future. But that is Hardly the Thing that Sold this one to the ""Mob"".It's Epic Appeal, mostly done with CGI, was its Bloodletting, Hero/Saviour (the muscled up Russell Crowe), and its Simplistic Display of ""Wrestle-Mania"" Spectacle.Joaquin Phoenix is the Over the Top, Effeminate, Incestuous, Megalomaniac Villain. Connie Nielsen is His Sister with Her Young 8 Year Old Son in Tow that Phoenix uses for Blackmailing Her into Submission.Other Supporting Characters make Mild Impressions. Oliver Reed as a Slave (Gladiator) Trader, Derek Jacobi as a Senator, Djimon Hounsou as Crowe's Token Sidekick, and Richard Harris as the Aging Caesar.Overall, it is a Lazy, Hazy, Sword and Sandal Modernization that has more Pretensions than it can Sustain. Not Taken Seriously it's an Entertaining Oscar Hog that is Overrated but Worth a Watch. The CGI doesn't Hold Up all that well, but in 2000 A.D., it had some Appeal.","

Beautifully shot, with just the right amount of violence and emotion, it's a good technical film as well. Some may find parts of it to be a little cheesy, or some of the side characters to just be meh, those flaws are greatly overshadowed by the leads.Crowe is fantastic of course, but Joaquin Phoenix steals the film with an incredible performance as Commodus. From his first scene, to the last, you build an intense hate for his character. His creepy nature just rubs it all in.This was the first film I saw (when it came out) that I then knew of Phoenix's skills and potential. He's been a favorite ever since.","

"Gladiator","Bob-45","26 June 2000","I wanted to like GLADIATOR, I really did.  My sister said it was a great movie, and I really wanted to please my sister.  But I can't, you see, because GLADIATOR is not a great movie.  In fact, GLADIATOR is not even a particularly good movie.GLADIATOR is ineptly directed by  Ridley Scott; no two ways about it.  What else can explain keeping scenes in which the otherwise competent Russell Crowe lets his Australian accent slip through?  What else Can explain allowing leading lady Connie Nielson sleepwalk through her performance for two thirds of the Movie?  What else can explain carefully crafting a subplot involving a German Shepherd dog, then abruptly dropping it?  The ineptitude goes on and on.  The lack of chemistry between Crowe and Nielson is bad enough without further undercutting it with obtrusive, inappropriate music in early key scenes.  High- and low-key cinematography is intermixed without any concern for dramatic appropriateness.  It is almost as though Scott said, `Cloudy day? No problem, the audience won't notice.'  And lets talk about this cinematography.  Many of the low-key interiors with Joaqin Phoenix and Connie Nielson are so poorly lit, you cannot see Phoenix's eyes!  Poor Phoenix, probably the least experienced of the leads, has the toughest role.  Despite what you may hear, Phoenix does pretty well, despite Scott's undercutting.  ACTION FANS BE WARNED. Scott shoots ALL the action scenes without benefit of long shot (for perspective) and with computer generated and slow-motion action.  Think widescreen movie being shown in television (3:4) format.  Expect to be more confused than entertained.There IS plenty to like in GLADIATOR.  The late Oliver Reed as the gladiator owner is magnificent.  Richard Harris is very good as Marcus Aurelius. Djimon Hounsu, Derek Jacobi, David Schofield, Sven Ole-Thorsen and, especially,  Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) are all fine in supporting roles. Savor them if you must see GLADIATOR.","

"Gladiator","mahen1","10 March 2005","Poignant and evocative as this movie is, no way should it have been best picture. The story is too thin, the script lacks sufficient sophistication. Marcus Aurelius to Maximus'give Rome back to the people it belongs'. Way too vague and general a statement the like of which is repeated too often.Mind you this is a good film, powered by Crowe and the fabulous music of Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer. Gerrard's voice in the dream sequences is fantastic. Crowe has great presence. His Maximus is tired of fighting even before the fighting begins at the beginning of the film. The look on his face at the beginning says it all - a man duty bound to his orders, yet tired and sad at the nature of his duty, yet confident in his own ability and that of his soldiers to carry them out. Crowe retains his tortured tough guy look right the way through.As impressive as the action sequences are at the beginning in the German forest and later in the colosseum, the film looks way too grainy. It's alright for the early sequences where the forest is supposed to be dark and gloomy anyway, but Rome should have been more light and clarity. Special effects and art direction in this sense are a let down.The supporting cast is not given much to work with by the weak script. Derek Jacobi has almost nothing to do, Joaquin Phoenix's villain is just way too one dimensional (not really the actor's fault). Connie Nielsen easily stands out as Maximus' ex-love.I think it's the powerful emotions aroused by the Gerrard-Zimmer music and Crowe's screen presence which propelled this to best picture status. The story and script are just too weak to merit it. Ridley Scott doesn't make bad films, but the visual weaknesses of the film in parts prevent him being praised too much for this effort. He has enough good films under his belt anyway.","

The production would have cost 1/200 of the ""Gladiator"" budget, and you would have left the cinema feeling as silly and empty, but not as cheated, as after seeing this ""white elephant"". Unfortunately, this never-ending melodrama has been hailed as a masterpiece by the lovers of over-amplified sound effects, boringly fake visuals and gratuitous violence; and as in a Roman circus, it has been crowned with awards that make it look worst than it is. They all have shown more inspiration than the filmmakers in tracing a parallel between the Roman empire and the present one. What a shame.","

"Gladiator","BA_Harrison","27 April 2018","In the event of his death, ageing Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) intends to leave his trusted Hispano-Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe) in charge of Rome, instead of allowing his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) to become his successor. Commodus has other ideas: he murders his father and orders Maximus to be executed. Maximus, not one to give up quietly, makes a daring escape, and, badly wounded, heads for home, where he discovers that his wife and son have been crucified on Commodus' orders. Passing out from the pain of his injury, Maximus is captured by slavers, nursed back to health and forced to fight as a gladiator. This new life eventually leads him to the Colosseum of Rome, where he finally comes face to face with the man who betrayed him.From director Ridley Scott, Gladiator is a historical epic to rival the classics from the 'golden age' of Hollywood. Opening in 180 A.D., with a brilliantly orchestrated battle between the Roman armies and the tribes of Germania, Scott's film grabs the viewer's full attention from the outset and doesn't let go until the end, having delivered an Oscar-winning central performance from Crowe, a memorable score by Hans Zimmer, excellent supporting roles from the likes of Harris, Phoenix, Connie Nielsen and Oliver Reed, and some of the most impressively bloody scenes of hand to hand combat ever filmed.If I were to choose my favourite scene, it would be the 're-enactment' of the battle of Carthage, a savage piece of action cinema in which Maximus and his fellow gladiators are ushered into the arena like cattle to the slaughter, only to turn the tables on their attackers, winning the hearts of the Roman masses in the process. A rousing, blood drenched spectacle, it's a fine example of Scott's expert direction, a masterclass in camera placement and movement, editing (the violence is extreme, but the film doesn't wallow in the gore), sound design and special effects, which still thrills even after all of these years.","

"Gladiator","repulsion","17 December 2000","The denizens of the Roman Empire were a particularly bloodthirsty lot, and apparently not that far off in mentality from our own culture. The vox populi, bored to the heavens with the multitudinous burdens inflicted on them by their government, seek escape in the mind-numbingly bland entertainment provided within the Colosseum. Gladiators fend for their lives against a series of uniquely dressed foes and beasts, all in the hope of winning their freedom. Everything about this testosterone-toned epic is meant to cater to a population who likes their filmed landscapes served to them WWF-style.Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a top army general in the army of Marcus Auerlius (Richard Harris), a dying patriarch who (in predictable fashion) unwittingly causes trouble within the family ranks by offering his throne to Maximus instead of to his son Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix). Auerlius' son is the kind of whinny, pussy-whipped boy that your audience likes to hate because the character's moral fiber makes the character so easily expendable. Commodus' temper tantrums lead to patricide and the film turns into an interminably messy three-hour affair simply centering on the standard theme of revenge.Maximus is sent to die in the woods but manages to get the upper hand and kill Commodus' henchmen. He returns to his homestead only to find his wife and son lynched from trees. Poor Maximus is denied the throne of Rome and is now being fueled to wage a one-man war against the sissy who wiped away his entire family. As Maximus works his way back to Rome, unbeknownst to the new king Commodus, our foppish king swishes around the kingdom ridiculously hitting on his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielson) and hovering inappropriately over his nephew Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark).In the first hour Ridley Scott has expertly painted his archetypal figures, forcing us to love the brave Maximus, wifeless and sonless, and hate the creepy teenager with the thirst for forbidden fruit. Maximus, once back in Rome, manages to enter a gladiator troop manned by one Proximo, the late Oliver Reed. This little group of circus freaks will provide Maximus with the proper cover through which he can maneuver himself into the hearts of Rome's people. Not only is the man driven by revenge but he is also cocky enough to believe that he has what it takes to accomplish the sort of feats no other gladiator has been able to accomplish. By his side is Juba (Djimon Hounsou), the proverbial Black voice of wisdom. If not for Will Smith's more unfortunately stereotypical role in Legend of Bagger Vance, this would have been the kind of role that would have garnered the deserved scorn of people like Spike Lee.For two hours, Scott inundates us with endless arena fireworks that would serve the acrobatics of the Rock and Hulk Hogan to a much better effect. The characterization of Crowe's character amounts to nothing more than a cocksure man, full of false bravado, whose only apparent skill is to raise his arm into the air and scream for his men to surge into battle. He is the kind of screen character who wages war against hundreds of foes within the course of a movie and manages to dispose of all of them with relative ease. He is also the kind of superhero archetype that garners the admiration of young boys like Lucius, something which causes our dear Commodus to go even further over the edge.Scott is to be admired in the end for at least not being a hypocrite, as he practices what he preaches. Since the citizens of Rome seem only to live for bloodlust, Scott manages to paint Gladiator as nothing else than that: entertainment geared for audiences whose sole interest is seeing men and tigers beat the s**t out of each other for three hours. But if this is all there was to the film then one would see little complaints from my person but Scott makes the mistake of filling his film with arty flourishes.The film opens with Maximus walking across a field, his hands slowly caressing tall blades of grass. These flashbacks, along with various cutaways to fast-moving skyscapes, amount to nothing more than pretentious attempts to add artistic credibility to an otherwise sophomoric film. Its as if he is aware of the fact that his film is devoid of any three-dimensional resonance that he tries to quickly interject soft touches of humanity into the proceedings. The end result is nothing less than visual illiteracy, ringing completely false and cowardly.When it comes to epics none come better than Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev or Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, two masterworks from Russia's greatest directors that fully captured the three-dimensional scope of war. The bad guys in these films, unlike the one played by Phoenix in Gladiator, are the kinds of foes whose selfishly malicious journeys are never cartoonishly drawn. The landscapes created by the Russian masters were poetic and grand, full of visual and emotional urgency. Scott's film is amounts to nothing more than being beat over the head by a club for three hours.","

Star Wars, popular as it was, made the mistake of actually being about something; I'm happy to say that Gladiator has no redeeming value whatever. Just blood, mud and crud. Some of the killing made me laugh out loud, like when Crowe stabbed a guy with two swords and then chopped off his head while he was still standing. When Oliver Reed went into that monologue, accompanied by full orchestra, about the thrill of the cheering crowd I almost thought he was going to sing There's No Business Like Show Business. You know something is a bit over the top when one of the most restrained performances comes from Richard Harris! Another big laugh was when Crowe and Djimon win the crowd over by becoming the first ""tag team"" gladiators in pre-television history. Film pictures all the gladiators as united against some unnamed enemy over on the other side of the arena, thus daintily skirting the more Spartacus-like reality that the gladiators fought and killed each other -- and therefore, presumably, were hard put to have indulged themselves in the kind of emotional ties we see here. When the leading lady (Connie Nielsen, in fact just about the only woman) arranges to meet Crowe privately, she explains for the audience's sake that patrician women purchased sexual favors this way all the time. Seems to me everybody onscreen would know that already! It's like in The Mikado where Yum Yum turns halfway toward the audience and says to Nanky Poo ""But darling, you forget: in Japan..."" except that in the latter case WS Gilbert meant it as a joke. The one thing that dampened the pace was long dialogue scenes between the battles, as if the movie were hunting desperately for some intellectual point that would justify its existence, not unlike the '63 Cleopatra in that way. Unnecessary in either case, serving only to protract the running time. Gladiator should be at least a half hour shorter than it is. Audience ate it up, though.A friend commented ""Gladiator will live on TNT and USA forever!"" but I think she underestimates basic cable: there will probably also be a series starring Lorenzo Lamas.","

"Gladiator","movieandtvfanatic","14 March 2010","Some movies manage to split the public and critics' opinions right down the middle but still manage to do well at the box office and get tons of awards notice and high ratings. ""Gladiator"" is one of the biggest examples of this, and I am in the camp that finds this to be a weak film.2000 was fairly weak year for movies, but this isn't an excuse for ""Gladiator"" winning the Best Picture Oscar. You still had great films that were completely snubbed like ""Almost Famous"" (my choice), Billy Elliot, Cast Away, Wonder Boys, and among the nominees, Traffic. These films represented the few glimmering moments of film in 2000.Gladiator has actually grown on me with repeated viewings but it is still by no means a great or even good movie. I feel that Russell Crowe did not deserve the Oscar over his entire category and while I am not a huge fan of him as an actor or from what his persona perceives, he did give good performances in ""L.A. Confidential"", ""Romper Stomper"", ""The Insider"", and ""Cinderella Man"" and these went relatively unnoticed (save for ""The Insider""). The movie just didn't feel like a Best Picture winner either. It had all of the right ingredients but it came out stale and bland.","

"Gladiator","athena24","19 August 2005","When I saw the movie in the theater for the first time I said it was OK. Not a great movie but worth seeing. Of course this is mainly for the battles that are amazing. And the score to the movie is fair enough. But I had a feeling that there is something wrong with this movie. It seemed that this is a replica of Braveheart. Only in Braveheart I got emotional without wanting it and in Gladiator I wanted to but I couldn't, It just wasn't so. The next time I saw it on DVD I noticed that each time I waited for the fights, because everything else is dumb. The plot unveils in turtle pace, the dialogs are over dramatic, it just like all the characters will burst with tears in minute after they say something. The most annoying thing is the plot itself. The characters look very unrealistic and unconvincing, a lot of time is wasted on unnecessary talk and the end can be predicted from the beginning.Well, a little bit of history for the end. There was an Emperor Marcus Aurelius that was considered as a ""good"" emperor, that ended the era of ""the five good emperors"". His son that succeeded him was Commodus ( just like in the movie ), but he's not killed his father. Marcus Aurelius died from a disease. Commodus himself was an excellent fighter. He fought with his father in the north, and after he became an emperor he tested himself each time in the coliseum arena with the gladiators and the beasts, and won each and every battle. Commodus killed by an athlete called Narcissus in his bath. Commodus considered himself a god and wanted people to think of him the same which can be viewed as insanity but for sure he wasn't weak and Coward as he was portrayed in the movie. He also ruled for 12 years, something that the movie doesn't count for.One commercial movie for Ridley Scott, but definitely one of the dumbest he made ( there is always G.I.Jane for this title ). Go see Alexander. Much closer to history, much better movie.","

"Gladiator","Maciste_Brother","10 January 2010","As a fan of Peplum films (or Sword & Sandal) and having enjoyed previous films from Ridley Scott, I was surprised by how disappointing GLADIATOR was.The first thing that stood out is how badly shot it was. The DP (and Scott) missed the boat on this one. The film's constant greyish tone was off putting and uninspired. It tries to give the film a realistic look but comes across as forced and in the end more fake than anything else. Because the look of the film wasn't believable, the film's other weaknesses stood out even more, like the acting. Except for Joaquin and the veteran cast, the acting was sub-par. Crowe is monotonous, almost sleepwalking through the entire epic. He can't really be blamed as his character is as one dimensional as possible. He acts like a robot, an unstoppable robot who kills everyone in sight. In one scene, Maximus enters the stadium grounds and proceeds to kill a dozen other gladiators, one after the other, in a single run. The scene is so ludicrous that the reality of the film flew out the window and couldn't get into the predictable story with Maximus reduced to a Roman version of Rambo.The monotonous look of the film also can't camouflage the obvious CGI which today looks even more cardboady than it did 9 years ago. To make things even more tedious, the entire film is a direct rip-off of Anthony Mann's THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, which, albeit wasn't great but at least it respected the intelligence of its audience, unlike GLADIATOR which is the fast food version of history. All of this could have been overlooked had the film been entertaining on some level but the slow pace, ponderous tone and predictable story killed all possibilities for it being entertaining. It's not a fun film at all.In the end, GLADIATOR, which won the Oscar for best picture (it must have been a really bad year), is not even remotely memorable in any way shape or form. Give me a vintage Italian Sword & Sandal flick, like THE REBEL GLADIATORS, before this inert Hollywood production.","

"Gladiator","ranev","20 January 2002","It's starts out like any good epic should with a masterfully filmed and executed exciting battle sequence that sets up the audience for one of those rare Hollywoodian confections that are both entertaining and artsy. Unfortunately, it all goes downhill from there. It isn't the performers faults since every single one of them give amazing, emotional, even, at times, riveting performances (the kinds you should find in better movies) and who give the whole picture more class than it deserves. It isn't Hanz Zimmer's nor Lisa Gerrard's fault since they have composed a score that's almost (and I do mean almost) as unforgettable as the Godfather's. And it certainly isn't Ridely Scott's fault since he yet again succeeds in immersing the audience in the world he has created. No, the ones who are to blame are the people who wrote the saccharine, clichéd, soap-opery script and who, in the process, have wasted all of this incredible talent. They should be fed to the lions. It's an entertaining B-movie that could have been a classic. Just like Titanic in a way.","

"Gladiator","anaconda-40658","8 June 2015","Gladiator (2000): Dir: Ridley Scott / Cast: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris, Oliver Reed: Visually stunning depiction starring Russell Crowe as a gladiator whose life is marked by violence in an ugly fashion of sport. He is framed for murder and sentenced to death but he survives only to discover that his wife and son were crucified and burned. Central plot thrusts him in gladiator games where he spends wasted time hacking up soldiers. Triumphant art direction cannot save repetitious story. Director Ridley Scott successfully creates the era but this is hardly a match for his superior films such as Alien and Blade Runner. Crowe carries the film going from honoured soldier to a fighter placed within a bloody game of survival where only his revenge drives him. Joaquin Phoenix overacts tremendously as Caesar who is basically a cardboard villain destine for death and when it happens, it lacks the intended satisfaction. Wasted appearances by Connie Nielsen and Richard Harris. Oliver Reed even appears as an old gladiator who likely wiped his ass with toilet paper that contained more than what this screenplay does. The art direction and visual elements are in top form. The film reflects the Roman Empire and violent sport to entertain the lust for violence. Unfortunately the repetition and violent exploits of the screenplay render this perhaps the most overrated film of the year. Score: 4 ½ / 10","

"Gladiator","jackjack-2","3 June 2001","Many critics blasted this film yet Hollywood fell in love it. Because of the critics I did not watch it until it was shown on HBO. I was appalled with its historical inaccuracy.Basically, Russell Crowe plays the role of a General in the Roman Army under the Roman Emperor Ceaser Marcus Aurelius, who many historians consider as one of the greatest Roman emperors. Marcus died while in Germany in 180 AD. His son, Commodus became the full emperor and made peace with the Germans.
It is at this point that the movie departs from history. In the movie, just befor Marcus Aurelius died he was going to appoint his successor. The fact is that he appointed Commodus co-emperor in 177 AD, three years before he died.The movie makes the point that Marcus Aurelius had no confidence that his son was suitable to be emperor. That much is true and the movie asserts that he tried to appoint someone else to succeed him. That is untrue. If he considered Commodus unfit to rule, why did he make him co-ruler? Because if he hadn't, under Roman custom, his son had to die if he was not made the successor.The story gets more bizarre as it goes on. Russell Crowe escapes execution by Commodus and his family is slain by Commodus, who does not know that Crowe is not dead. As cruel as Commodus is, it is unlikely he would have killed the family of Crowe. It would have served no purpose. In the process Crowe becomes a slave gladiator and winds up in Rome fighting as a gladiator before Commodus. So highly unlikely.I won't give you the ending but it is pure fiction. However, I will tell you what really happened. In 182 Commodus' sister Lucilla conspired with a group of senators to assassinate him. The plot failed, and Commodus retaliated by executing a number of leading senators. Thereafter, his rule became increasingly arbitrary and vicious. In 186 he had his chief minister executed in order to appease the army; three years later he allowed the minister's successor to be killed by a rioting crowd. Political influence then passed to the emperor's mistress and two advisers.Meanwhile, Commodus was lapsing into insanity. He gave Rome a new name, Colonia Commodiana (Colony of Commodus), and imagined that he was the god Hercules, entering the arena to fight as a gladiator or to kill lions with bow and arrow. Finally, when Commodus announced that he would assume the consulship on Jan. 1, 193, dressed as a gladiator, the public became incensed. On Dec. 31, 192, his advisers had him strangled by a champion wrestler.","

Gladiator, I can just sit there and watch it, because if you miss a part, you won't get it. The end was great, i really liked it. It was the best fight scene at the end.

"Gladiator","inspectors71","7 December 2005","And Ridley Scott ain't Stanley Kubrick! Scott's sort-of remake of the modestly brilliant and richly emotional Spartacus and the horrendously bad Fall of the Roman Empire is a visually breathtaking epic that has almost no soul. I can't think of a reason to watch this movie other than to be entertained by three hours of close up violence, dazzling computer graphics, Russell Crowe's manliness, Connie Nielsen's loveliness, and Joaquim Phoenix's pree-versions.Done with the movie? You've got nothing to show for it.I don't worry too much about the myriad historical inaccuracies, such as the Roman Republic being reestablished at the end of Gladiator or Marcus Aurelius being murdered (if you have a clue about Roman history, you've just got to grin and bear it), but it's the reliance on the razzle-dazzle of the computer over the emotional depth of the characters that wears Gladiator down and leaves it bleeding in the center of the arena. The opening battle in Germany is eye-popping (and stomach-turning) in its recreation of a fight between Crowe's legion and a pack of Teutonic mouth-breathers. You're supposed to be impressed and hooked, but then the internecine backstabbing, betraying, and incestuous hanky-pankying start and you're left waiting for the next trip into some North African arena where you can watch people get disemboweled in the same grainy fashion as in Saving Private Ryan.It's all very appealing at a lizard-at-the-bottom-of-the-brain pan level (When I saw Gladiator in a theater in Ontario, Oregon, I heard a kid complaining, ""When are we gonna see her (Nielsen) naked?""). Front-load the gore and the kink, dazzle the viewer with recreations of the Roman world, and you don't need to get past Russell Crowe's growling and Phoenix's fussy sickness.Gladiator is emotionally empty. Stick with Kubrick's slave revolt.","

"Gladiator","Indy-52","4 June 2001","GLADIATOR is a fantastic achievement in modern filmmaking. I never expected to ever see another Roman epic, but Ridley Scott has proved it is possible. What's so great about this movie is that it has a really entertaining and enthralling storyline, not just special effects and action (although it has a lot of that): it knows how to make us care about the people in it and how to develop a sense of style and elegance (thanks to director Ridley Scott). The movie is fueled by a number of powerhouse performances: Russell Crowe is perfect as the title character, I loved Oliver Reed as Proximo, and Joaquin Phoenix made a perfectly hissable villain. I was amazed at how exciting this movie was. Although the opening battle sequence is not very promising, with its confusing, chaotic editing, after that it's just uphill: the film will send you on roller-coaster ride of nonstop thrills. The effects are very well done: there is a scene where we see Commodus arrive at Rome as the new emperor that's absolutely breathtaking. I also loved the way they recreated the Colosseum. Parts of this movie are truly awe-ispiring. The fights in the arenas are spectacularly sensational. I must also mention John Mathieson's absolutely beautiful cinematography and Hans Zimmer's perfect music score. Some scenes where Mathieson's visuals and Zimmer's music mix are undescribably beautiful and breathtaking. The entire film is beautiful: just about any frame of it would make a really good poster to stick on the wall. I recommend this film to those who appreciate to finest things in life.","

I cannot fault the picture/cinematography at all. But, this is the only thing the film has going for it, and this alone cannot save a film.'Gladiator' was over-rated as a classic epic of its time. The story is complex and very dull in many places, and it could have been shortened. Now, I am a big fan of historical fiction films, but this one just did not do it. The story was very weak, and I could not get into it at all. The characters were also another problem. I felt that I could not relate to them. The film is not as engaging - the characters and story are weak so much that none of the great things about this film make a difference.

"Gladiator","kevin142","20 October 2005","The old Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius wanted to give the power to his favorite general Maximus. Due to envy, Commodus killed his father Marcus and claimed him as the lawful successor. The misfortune fell on Maximus. After he lost his family, he did not want to live anymore. However life did not go on as he wanted. He was trained as a gladiator. It mattered life and death. If you wanted to survive, you had to kill the opponent.The final duel between Maximus and Commodus was the most soul-stirring duel I ever watched. Although Maximus was a powerful general, he was a kind and generous person. It was his kindness that made him become the victim of insidious Commodus.

And your wife moaned like a whore when they ravaged her again and again... and again.""Gladiator is an amazing story of revenge. It is a story of one man's struggle to challenge the emperor of Rome, wearing nothing but slaves' attire, being sold as a gladiator for the people's morbid amusement, and seeking vengeance for having his family murdered through these 'games'. It is also a political story about justice in the midst of corruption, interwoven with swords, sandals and battlefields á la epic war saga. This, my friends, is a true underdog story with a hero so poignant that it is impossible not to be engrossed in his struggle.Whatever _I_ will say about this film will simply be semi-coherent, rambling praise as I like the works of Ridley Scott so much. However, far from everyone liked Gladiator (2000). Roger Ebert disliked it. Moviegoers criticized it for being unoriginal  a mild rip-off of Spartacus (1960) and the likes. It may have been warmly received by the Academy, but audiences were very divided when it was released. I'd like to think that I am usually able to see things from other people's perspective, but just this once, how could you not be entertained?So although I usually trust Roger Ebert a great deal, I have absolutely no idea what he was on about in panning the film for its gloomy tone and ""muddy, fuzzy and indistinct"" skies. Maybe he simply forgot to clean his widescreen TV, because the Gladiator I know sees hugely epic games under a brilliant blue sky in the coliseum, a glorious tournament that is so entertaining because of its flair. The final battle has ROSES RAINING FROM THE SKY! It does not get more vivid or colourful than that.These battle-scenes of Gladiator are, of course, extremely well tended to by Ridley Scott who is the master at crafting epic war scenarios (see, I told you fanboy-praise would sneak its way in!). The patient, slow pacing of the film seems to take a sudden halt here, and then fast-forward in an amazingly rapid-fire pace with quick shots, swinging swords, vivid skies and a great score by Hans Zimmer to further emphasize the dramatic mood. The very culmination of this is not at the end, but rather early. It is the moment that Maximus (a superb Russell Crowe) removes his helmet, reveals his identity and faces the emperor, after a long and ferocious battle. It is a scene so poignant that I always wish it would have been saved until later on in the film, thereby giving it even more weight. But no matter, because rest assured that it is goosebumps-inducing enough.A gloriously entertaining, heartfelt and carefully crafted war adventure by Ridley Scott in which little feels missing or incomplete. What more could you ask for? Great acting from the cast, I suppose  well, this is also present in Gladiator. Best of all, the actors have good dialogue to work with so they don't choke on the dated lines. Russell Crowe propels this film with his heroic personality, Connie Nielsen adds introspective depth, and Joaquin Phoenix is excellent as the twisted but idealist emperor Commodurus. 9/10","

"Gladiator","Epaminondas","24 January 2005","Russell Crowe's fine performance as an ex-general turned into a slave and then a gladiator cannot save this picture from its utter absurdity, as the ending stages a pathetic duel between him and (no kidding) the Emperor of Rome in the Coliseum!!! There are some impressive scenes in the film, and Crowe has a beautiful screen presence; his friendship with a fellow Numidian gladiator is nicely conveyed, as is his attachment to amulets representing his family; the revelation of his identity is aptly charged with tension; and the preparation of the first battle is superb. Alas, it then turns into an orgy of gore.Being an ancient Greek (Theban to be precise) general, I'm bound to have qualms about this film's treatment of antiquity. As many reviewers have noted, the sole idea of a roman citizen (let alone a general) being turned into a slave is absurd, as is the trip from Germania to Spain during which Crowe seems to pass through some sort of rocky desert before entering the hills of Tuscany... How familiar is the filmmaker with the geography of Europe I wonder? Depictions of power relations in Rome are also quite laughable.But it is the voyeuristic stance and contemporary political relevance of the film which I find most disturbing. The despisal/fascination for the 'mob' which runs through the film has a distinctly fascist tinge. The violence is in some places unbearable, all the more so as it is gratuitous (the slaughter of Maximus' son)... My deep rejection and indeed contempt for the film really developed from listening to Ridley Scott's commentary on the DVD, in which he avows, among other depressing platitudes, that he would really have liked to live in Roman times, granted he was among the wealthy ruling classes... Probably in order to enjoy the spectacle of death and violence he in turn successfully inflicts on his twentieth-century teenage audience. The implications of such a fascination for slavery and violence are frightening, and make one want to watch SPARTACUS over and over again, as a reminder of the times in which Hollywood stood for humanist values, and not their despisal. It is also an opportunity to find where many seemingly novel ideas in GLADIATOR actually originate...All in all, despite how much we want to believe in Crowe, the film is far from the historical and psychological complexity (and visual clarity in battle scenes) of the much-underrated Alexander. Indeed, Crowe would have been perfect in the part, and would probably have had the guts to oppose to the wearing of Colin Farrell's ridiculous blonde wig!","

Ridley Scott really did something masterful here because I think this film showed an exceptional deft touch in terms of balancing accuracy and legitimacy with the feel of the movie, that emotional resonance that can overwrite some nonsense.Crowe's understated, quiet performance is perfect for Maximus and Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus is just a reminder of how skilled that man is. It's a real Batman/Joker kind of vibe with the stoic hero and the crazy, sadist villain and Phoenix is able to put these layers in there that make Commodus feel so complex and deep. It's something we're missing from a lot of villains these days who are just ""I'm big and bad because... Because!"" Instead he manages to make this character both sniveling and pathetic but also terrifying!After all this praise, it's weird to say that I don't love this movie.

"Gladiator","bbhlthph","9 June 2006","'Gladiator' received numerous awards and has attracted over 2000 largely favourable user comments on IMDb. Although my comments will not be well received by those who regard it as a great film, I believe this is an APPALLING film which should never have been released. A film can be appalling because of bad direction, bad acting, or just plain bad photography - none of these are the problem here. A film can also be appalling because it plagiarises an earlier film too closely without giving any recognition to it, because it is intellectually dishonest, because its contents are antisocial, or because its nature is such that it is highly prejudicial to the film industry as a whole - the last three of these concerns all seem to me to arise with Gladiator. Some IMDb users have expressed concerns about plagiarism - noting its very close structural similarities to 'Braveheart' (1995) and 'Tarkan' (1969), but these are not my concern. When the scenario of a new film is totally different to its predecessor it is hard to justify condemning it for plagiarism.'Gladiator' features exactly the same scenario as the 1964 film 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' which is quite an elegant work that probably deserved to be more successful than it was. But it had one fatal flaw. It was promoted as an historically accurate account of the relatively short historical period when the Roman Empire appears to have undergone a fundamental transformation from an aggressive expansionist would be world empire to a survivalist mode where its main concern became the protection of its existing boundaries. This period, well documented by Gibbon and others, occurred after the death by disease of the stoic Emperor Marcus Aurelius whilst on campaign in A.D. 180. His son Commodus, who had already been co-emperor for three years, assumed full authority at the early age of nineteen with the support of Marcus's trusted advisers, but gradually after four years rule he became increasingly cruel and capricious, showing many signs of insanity, and finally acting in such a way that he was murdered in a palace conspiracy. His successor tried to repair the damage done to the fabric of Roman society but ultimately proved too weak and was murdered in turn, leading to a long period of increasing instability. The highly respected Will Durant was listed as historical consultant for the making of this 1964 film, but his advice was clearly neglected as the film incorrectly showed Marcus rejecting his son as heir to the throne, and his son responding by murdering his father and seizing the throne. Later it showed Commodus killed in the Arena whereas he was in fact drugged and strangled in his palace. Incredibly, this totally fictitious story from the earlier film was repeated in Gladiator. To me this makes the film unacceptable for intellectual dishonesty. We are told it is just a film prepared for entertainment. Fine - BUT ONLY IF IT DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A HISTORICAL FILM. 'The Sign of the Cross', 'Ben Hur', 'Quo Vadis' and 'Caesar and Cleopatra' were promoted as films of literary works not as historical works, and I have no problem with this. But a film has an enormous audience compared with a historical treatise and, if it is thought to be presenting real history, its inaccuracies can be very misleading. Most people who lived through the holocaust have now died and already a concerted campaign, making extensive use of the media to deny that it ever happened, is under way. If public perception of its reality is ever reduced to the status of a largely mythical event, it will severely handicap the chance of humanity learning essential lessons from history. YES, HISTORICAL ACCURACY IS OF IMPORTANCE, certainly in everything except a declared work of fiction.'Gladiator' is also appalling because much of its appeal comes from the graphic killing of one human being by another in the name of sport. The Roman Games started as athletic contests with readings of literature and dramatic presentations, followed quite early by events involving the public punishment and execution of criminals. The latter evolved into gladiatorial contests where criminals who would be useful in the all important Roman armies could redeem themselves; and much later into the staging of public atrocities which sometimes even featured women and children being killed by wild beasts or burned alive. It has taken humanity many hundreds of years to totally reject such 'entertainment' and pogroms of various types still occur in many parts of the world with alarming frequency. The first step towards establishing higher standards is the banning of public executions, but 'Gladiator' makes extensive use of computer generated images which give all the vicarious thrills of watching whilst one person kills another. It also takes a giant step along the slippery slope of virtual reality which could eventually permit viewers to 'experience' actual participation in such events. IS THIS WHAT WE REALLY WANT FROM THE CINEMA? The 1934 Hayes code which crippled the North American film industry for many years resulted from an overwhelming public demand to restrict films that overstepped the bounds of public acceptability. A third reason why 'Gladiator' is an appalling film is that it has pushed the limits of acceptability to the point where there will be demands for some new form of censorship. Today there is more and more emphasis being put on self regulation whether in government or in corporate life. If the film industry cannot face up to its need for some self regulation IT MAY LOSE ITS ARTISTIC FREEDOM AND BE RETURNED TO THE DARK AGES OF EXTERNALLY IMPOSED PRODUCTION 'CODES'.","

"Gladiator","radoii_87","6 February 2014","Summer blockbusters are creatures of their own, aiming to cater to and exploit our lowest desires. Ridley perfectly understands this and consciously tries to redefine them when he gets a chance. Unlike many others, he knows what he is doing and approaches the matter with care instead of force. This works only because of him.We have a movie about a spectacle, in which we and the mob are one and the same. It's cynical as it bashes the industry and us, yet hopeful with its vision for the future. The visual style is novel and somewhat counterintuitive. Typically, one would expect huge cinematic battles, filled with bloodshed, as well as a very architecturally dimensional Rome, filled with pride of its history. Here, these are handed very differently, casually placed in the background. We imagine and deduce them from the eyes of the characters - very subtle, especially for a summer blockbuster. Instead, the focus here is on emotion and tension. Tension between a ""cheap entertainment thrill"" and ""strength and honor"". Judging by how successful this was, new endeavors should learn from it, as it shows that the audience expects something more. Crowe is utilized well here. Some of his scenes with Joaquin carry and project that tension for us to feed on.4/5 - Worth a watch. We've started to demand much more after this.","

"Gladiator","gogoschka-1","27 March 2019","GLADIATOR is a masterpiece of polished pulp Cinema with all the right ingredients: visceral fights and battles; a beautiful, mysterious woman; a villain you love to hate and a hero with a code of honor (and arms like tree trunks); it has all the drama and heartbreaking betrayals and tragic deaths of a Telenovela and as much blood and testosterone as you'd find in a Rambo movie. It's simply glorious, spectacularly entertaining filmmaking - all delivered straight to the gut and without a shred of irony.And boy is this violent revenge tale and journey to ancient Rome beautiful to look at: every shot is framed like a painting; it's one of those gorgeous looking Ridley Scott films where every landscape becomes as much a protagonist of the film as the actors in it. As for those actors, they are never less than magnetic to watch, and especially Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe stand out; they bring an intensity and all-in approach to their roles that garnered them both Oscar nominations (Crowe won his).I sometimes hear the argument by certain self-professed film critics that GLADIATOR is too pulpy to really be considered a good film. I couldn't agree less. This is one rousing adventure and one beautiful movie with a fantastic cast - and it knows exactly what it wants, and it achieves it to a degree of perfection. It's about as cinematic an experience as film can offer, and it's as watchable today as it was nearly 20 years ago.P.S.

Russell Crowe is one bad a**  MF that kicks major b*tt.  Not to mention he looks so hot as he is decapitating and slashing the competition.  But what makes this movie great is the story line is heart felt and you feel for Maximus after his family is murdered. It is the ultimate tale of revenge.
Russell Crowe is a great actor. I never heard of him before Gladiator but since seeing this I have watched a bunch of other films he is in. He's pretty good in them all. He should have won the oscar for The Insider and for A Beautiful Mind rather than Gladiator though, but just because those two movies were more ""oscar-like"".

The score composed by Hans Zimmer and the action sequences in the arena. This is one of the best films happening in the times of the Roman empire and as said before, it is a masterpiece.

Movie audiences have long awaited a film which mixes history and action in such a way that it becomes memorable. Ridley Scott has become a true artist in his conception of action films. To date, few films have become so notable as this rendition of the last years of the Emperorer Marcus Aurelius( Richard Harris) on the Rhine. In this story we have a veteran Roman General (Russell Crowe) Maximus Meridius who having won yet another victory over the Germanic tribes, wishes nothing more than to go home and tend his crops. he asks his emperor for permission to go home, but before the wish is granted, he dies and his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) becomes the new ruler. Fearing the popular general is a threat to him, he orders him killed. Oliver Reed (In his last film) plays Proximo, an owner of slaves and gladiators saves him and offers him a chance for revenge. Derek Jacobi plays Gracchus who lends a splendid dignity to the film. Spencer Treat Clark is Lucius who finds the Spanish Gladiator admirable, courageous and interesting. Throughout the movies, one cannot but enjoy the settings, the costumes and the various sub-topics which make for drama at it's best. Highly recommended, this film is sure to become a Classic. ****","

"Gladiator","mOVIemAN56","26 March 2005","(Possible Spoilers)Gladiator could be considered the first great movie of the new millennium. It has story, it has history, it has romance, and it has action. But above all else, it has action. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is the leader of Emperor Marcus Aurelius' (Richard Harris) legion in Germany. After a horrific battle to open the film, the Emperor is murdered by his power-hungry son, Commidus (Joaquin Phoenix) and Maximus is sentenced to die. After an amazing escape, Maximus returns home to find his family murdered and home destroyed. Next thing you know he's being sold as a slave to Proximo (Oliver Reed) a gladiator owner. The film is filled with amazing battle sequences held in the arena and a story of revenge that nearly matches Ben-Hur's (1959). Russell Crowe does an excellent job as the betrayed servant of Rome and the ability Joaquin Phoenix shows as a truly insane emperor is amazing. This film has some of the best acting I have ever seen. The film won (If memory serves me right) numerous awards and gratitude from critique's. The Colliseum is a tad to big compared to its actual size yet the director is still able to show how advance the Roman's were when it came to construction, battle tactics, and government. The look of Roman society is a bit off but it does not matter as that is not the focus of the film.Gladiator. Starring: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielson, and Oliver Reed. 5 out of 5 Stars.","

"Gladiator","Christopher_Reid","27 June 2008","I think without a doubt that Gladiator's strengths are its simple but powerful story and its engaging performances. Other than that, however, I think the overall style of the film and the film-making itself are already quite badly dated and forgettable. It doesn't feel like the personal vision of a talented filmmaker (Ridley Scott in this case) but more like an anonymous miniseries with great actors and a very big budget. So, it's good but it should have been great and I find it frustrating because I think it's overrated and I don't know why so many people either can't see or just don't mind what appear to me to be obvious flaws.The action scenes are no longer very special. Braveheart had passionate battle scenes with very precise and skillful choreography. It's not that these ones aren't skillful, but they aren't very original and there's nothing particularly personal about them either. And of course, the special effects are well past their ""best before"" date so that aspect no longer helps a whole lot.Is Hans Zimmer a hack? He blatantly rips off Holst's ""Mars: The Bringer of War"" (and does it badly), not to mention tinges of Vangelis, but maybe Scott is in part to blame for this. His orchestral texture is typical of his scores, there's the obligatory march (that sounds a lot like Pirates of the Caribbean, which he had a hand in, not to mention the Michael Bay movies he's done) and worst of all he employs the subtlety of a sledge hammer when it comes to setting the mood in rousing or emotional scenes. One major exception to this in my opinion was Richard Harris' last scene which I found surprisingly good, as if the director gave him some freedom and he actually liked the scene. Otherwise, Zimmer's music fits the movie, or at least its obvious surface layer, perfectly. No risks. No depth. Plenty of formula.Russel Crowe's performance transcends the dated film-making. It's honest and gritty. Oliver Reed also stood out for me (especially his eyes) while the rest are more than engaging. Coupled with the effective story, the performances make the movie worth seeing (IMHO).So, weakness = formulaic film-making. Strength = story + acting. I reckon if you replaced Hans Zimmer's score with any thematically similar music and re-filmed all the non-dialogue scenes using any competent but disinterested cinematographer, Gladiator would be just as popular as it currently is.","

Joaquin Phoenix played the part of a jealous, cowardly Emperor perfectly.There are thousands of 'Reviews' on IMDB about Gladiator, so I'd like to
add a personal anecdote or two; in the first ten minutes or so there is a final battle between the might of the Roman Army and the ""Huns"" (German Tribes.)
This was the Battle of Teutenberg Forest and it was shot in a farmers field, called Bourne Woods - about two miles from where I used to live.Seems that when the producers approached the UK's Forrestry Commission for
permission to (literally) burn down the forest on the land, they were given
permission as the forest was due to be uprooted anyway. So the Commission
was happy for the movie makers to do the work for them. Amazing.Oliver Reed (RIP) was someone who used to frequent a local pub, and he would
tell tall tales to keep everyone ""entertained"" - his drinking was legendary.This movie, IMO, paved the way for others to follow: ""sword and sandals"", such
as Centurion, The Eagle, etc. and will be difficult if not impossible to beat.Another Scott helmed movie is The Kingdom of Heaven with Orlando Bloom and Eva Green. If you loved Gladiator, check this one out also.Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" - entertainment par excellence. 10/10. Easily.","

Extravagant full-fledged sword and sandal epic from filmmaking genius Ridley Scott takes on the scopic tale of a vengeance seeking Spanish general named Maximus (Crowe in a star-making turn) whose disposition from glorified soldier to slave to eponymous athlete in ancient Rome seeks to avenge the slaughter of his beloved family, his good name and ultimately self-redemption for the betrayal and murder of his mentor Marcus Auerelius (a haggard looking Harris) by his petulantly incestuous son Commoudus (hissably evil Phoenix) and dissuade his sister Lucilla (the divine Nielsen) from emotional imprisonment. Lavish set designs, bold visual effects (check out the Colosseum!), dark and stark cinematography by John Mathieson and Pietro Scalia's razor sharp editing particularly in the arena's carnage dripping bouts with effectively cringing moments of unbridled violence (including one bitchin' chariot fight) that honors its predecessors 'Ben-Hur' and 'Spartacus' well.

As his skills increase his strength he eventually comes to the games at Rome, where he finds himself anonymous and within striking distance of the revenge he seeks.If you strip away all the period settings and political battling in the background, this film is essentially a revenge film and a good one at that. It's best to ignore the liberties it takes with both logic and history and enjoy it for what it is.  At times it does threaten to take itself too seriously, but it's worthy sheen is just about supported by the emotive story and strong characters.  The film hits a good mix of political goings-on and action, with the action being the main body of the film.  It is delivered in bloody spades and the action scenes are a lot more dramatic than I expected.Although the characters fit into traditional revenge movie moulds (wronged man, evil man in position of power etc) they still manage to be strong characters in their own right.  Maximus is a strong hero and it is hard not to feel for him and thus get involved in the film.  True, the script is very generous in it's painting of him but this is a minor issue.  Crowe takes the lead really well and, while I don't personally care for him, he really fitted the role here.  Phoenix plays it well despite the fat he could easily have given into mugging the evil role.  Harris is good in his small role, although Jacobi just shows up once or twice.  Reed has a good part for his swansong but this is really Crowe's film and he commands it as his character does his army.The close of the film always gets me as it treats the characters and audience with respect (although it is not as daring as some would suggest. Overall this is a great film to watch as long as you don't take it too seriously or go looking for flaws.  The music and direction gives it a great feel  the music in particular used to support the required emotions created by the action.  Three hours go by very quickly and enjoyably.","

"Gladiator","Prichards12345","3 April 2010","I have to admit I'm somewhat puzzled by the highly-marked reviews and Oscars dished out to this movie. I watched this on Blue-Ray for the first time yesterday, and my partner really enjoyed it - she'd give it two marks higher. Me, I found it occasionally good, overlong, treacle-paced, with a lot of one dimensional characters and stock situations. And a horrible, stupid ending.Gladiator follows the exploits of General Maximus (Russell Crowe), successful military commander, being betrayed by Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix), who usurps his Roman Emperor father Marcus Arelius (Richard Harris). Finding his family brutally murdered, Maximus is captured by slavers who sell him to a Gladiator school run by former Gladiator Proximo (Oliver Reed) And from here Maximus sees a chance to avenge the murder of his family.In truth the movie is rather far-fetched but with some stirring combat sequences. The opening battle in Germania is not particularly well-staged (Cavalry charge through a forest?) I have to admit I found the chief merit in the film to be the performances of some of the actors. Richard Harris and Oliver Reed are excellent, as is Joaquin Pheonix, who unfortunately appears to be acting in a different movie from everyone else. He gives a sensitive portrayal of a descent into madness (never once does he go over the top) but the film is really crying out for a black-hat villain, and is weakened overall by the character of Commodus. You feel the senate would usurp him easily, and the Roman political scenes are hopelessly inadequate in capturing the spirit of Rome.Russell Crowe is extremely dull and wooden in the part of Maximus, and I can only assume that Oscars are awarded largely on the strength of studio campaigns. Crowe himself has given much better performances. The music is also a very clichéd variation on Mars The Bringer Of War.So, if you don't expect too much you might like it. To me it's far from a great movie. Ridley Scott has made many better films.","

"Gladiator","michaelsibley416","6 September 2004","""Gladiator"" is one of the best films of the year. I hesitated to see this film for a long time for many reasons; however, when I saw it the other night I was thrilled. Also, ""Gladiator"" is laced with great scenery including the Roman coliseum and enriched with the history of Roman culture. Watching this movie was an experience I will never forget because it is like watching history come alive. The film is rich in history, the writers made it fun to watch because we learned about the Roman coliseum, gladiators and life in Rome.""Gladiator"" is an energetic, action packed, drama filled thrill ride which will excite everyone. Two other movies came to mind when I was watching this film; ""The Patriot"" and ""Braveheart"" were very similar to ""Gladiator"" because they all contain unique action sequences, will become classics and all star actors in Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe, who have become major players in Hollywood. ""Gladiator"" may not be the best movie, but it will win over the hearts of viewers when they rent it at their local video stores. I can't wait to let everyone know ""Gladiator"" has become one of my favorite films. I hope everyone will enjoy it as I did. ""Gladiator"" is rich in history and is a masterpiece with all the trimmings.","

There are almost no flaws with the filming or acting (aside from the fact the Russell Crowe is in real life a loser). Crowe deserved his accademy award for acting.                   PLOT. A general in ancient Rome is forced to flee the land after not bowing before the new Emperor ( who killed his own father to be Emporer). And so Maximus ( the general) becomes a slave and must battle through Gladiator combat, hoping to avenge the death of the original emperor.           The film is packed with pulsating and gruesome violence and yet incredible acting abillity. 9.5 out of 10.

Terrific performances by the rest of the supporting cast. Cinematography and special effects are also flawless. And the writing.

"Gladiator","jlspenc-84630","4 June 2023","As the 20th century was drawing to a close, the big screen ancient Rome/Biblical epics so commonplace in the Fifties and early Sixties seemed to be as extinct as the dodo bird. But lo and behold, in the spring of 2000, kicking off a new century ~and millennium~ was Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR, a testosterone fuelled homage to the swords and sandals epics of decades past. It seemed a daring enterprise to pull off on paper, since recent summer fare was devoted to sequels, prequels, and other high octane blockbusters.But just five years earlier, BRAVEHEART proved that it was possible to turn a profit with an epic period piece with swords, skirmishes, and blood galore ~though it took almost six months to get into the black. GLADIATOR began as an outline by David Franzoni, a well travelled screenwriter who'd been fascinated with the archaeological sites of ancient Rome. He didn't seriously consider conceiving his story until he'd read a book about the gladiators entitled ""Those About To Die"". After scripting AMISTAD for DreamWorks Pictures, Franzoni was encouraged by co-founder Steven Spielberg to finish his screenplay.Whether Spielberg didn't think he was right for GLADIATOR, or had prior commitments, was never made clear, but the producers thought it was perfect for Ridley Scott. The British director had also been long entralled with the history of ancient Rome, both as a Republic and as an Empire. Scott liked Franzoni's concept, but felt that the dialogue needed more working on, so he brought in John Logan to give some of the words a contemporary feel for the audience's benefit.Having assembled a crew that would henceforth collaborate with him on future projects, Scott next turned his attention to the casting. Russell Crowe's breakout performance in L. A. CONFIDENTIAL caught his attention ~and just about everyone in Hollywood~ and he had no problem convincing the actor to sign on. However, Crowe had to quickly shed off the forty pounds he purposely gained for THE INSIDER if he was to be credible as a fighting general. By the time shooting was to begin, Crowe succeeded in bringing the weight down.GLADIATOR has almost the same plot as 1964's THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, an ambitious epic whose colossal failure ~it wasn't all that bad~ effectively killed the swords and sandals genre. How ironic is it that GLADIATOR becomes the picture that makes the genre fashionable again? Both have some of the same characters too. There's Marcus Aurelius ~obviously~ and his offspring Commodus and Lucilla. Crowe's Maximus, along with Proximo and Senator Gracchus, however, were fictional.GLADIATOR begins in 180 A. D. as Rome's long war with Germania is slowly winding down. Taking a page from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN's playbook, Scott devotes the first ten minutes of the picture to a rousing, bloody battle of cavalry charges, swords, flaming arrows, arrows without flames, crossbows, onagers, scorpios, and assorted catapults thrust against the enemy. When the blood spilling has concluded, the armies of Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) under the command of General Maximus have emerged victorious. Later to arrive at the front ~long after the fighting is over~ are the Emperor's children.The eldest of the two is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), ineligible to reign due to her gender; her father admiringly observes ""If only you'd been born a man. What an emperor you would have been"". She's better emotionally suited for the job than her mentally unstable brother Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), a spoiled stay-at-home warrior with delusions of grandeur, incestuous feelings, an insatiable desire for absolute power, and an obsession with personal loyalty....to him, not necessarily to the state. (Hmm, this might be my imagination, but doesn't he kinda remind of someone aiming to regain a position he lost fairly?)😬Now dying, Marcus Aurelius summons his favorite general ~whom he regarded as the son he truly wanted~ to his tent. Disillusioned over the corruption within Rome, he confides in Maximus his plans for the Empire upon his death. Decreeing Commodus as ""not a moral man"", Marcus plans to announce the next day to all the influential politicians in attendance that Rome is to become a republic again, just as it was before Julius Caesar seized power. And he wants Maximus, not Commodus, to temporarily rule as a Regent until magistrates can be elected to take over.As you might have expected, the mentally immature Commodus does not take the news very well when his father informs him he will not ascend to the throne. With no one else present in the tent,
he responds with patriicide by smothering the Emperor, and then demands that Maximus swear loyalty to him. Suspicious of Marcus' sudden passing, the General seals his fate by refusing the oath. After escaping execution from the Praetorian Guard, Maximus rushes home to his home in Spain, only to find that wife and young son have already been slaughtered.Stripped of his rank and presumes dead, a weary Maximus is captured by slave traders and sold to Proximo (Oliver Reed), the owner of a gladiator school, and himself formerly condemned to fight for a living (literally!) until winning his freedom by the late Emperor Gis true identity unknown to Proximo or his fellow combatants, the experienced warrior Maximus reigns supreme in the arenas as he entertains the masses, clinging to the hope of someday exacting revenge on the man who destroyed his life.Meanwhile, illegitimate monarch Commodus has returned to Rome in Dubya fashion ~remember the flight suit on the aircraft carrier?~ posturing himself as the conquering hero he clearly isn't. Anxious to quell his enemies, the young emperor quickly begins consolidating his rule with the aid of ruthlessly ambitious sycophants. His ultimate goal is to render the Senate impotent and eventually beholden to him, much to the alarm of the body's elder statesmen, especially Gracchus. They gain a sympathetic ear in Lucilla, who, like Maximus, was also suspicious of her father's sudden passing and her brother's hand in it. Unable to properly mourn for fear of reprisal, she (and Gracchus) can only bide her time until something, or someone, comes along to weaken Commodus' authority. Any guesses as to who that someone will be?","

"Gladiator","classicsoncall","28 June 2014","I saw Russell Crowe not too long ago in 2012's ""The Man With the Iron Fists"" where he looked about a hundred pounds heavier than he did here; his character was a mercenary named Jack Knife. It was quite a contrast then to see him once again in this film made a dozen years earlier. In fact, considering that Crowe was playing a Roman warrior, he actually looked like he might have been too small for the part. Well, so much for that.""Gladiator"" has an epic sweep not often seen in modern films, the opening battle scene makes you wonder if wars were actually fought that way in ancient times. The political intrigue involved in the plot to murder Maximus (Crowe) and it's failure sets up a dynamic story in which Maximus battles to regain respect and notoriety with the Roman citizenry. Personal relationships are put to the test as Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) proves to be a too cunning adversary to be defeated by normal means.You know, I had to replay the Commdodus/Maximus dungeon scene when Commodus stabbed his enemy, and it didn't make sense to me. When the blade struck Maximus, it appeared to go through his tunic which became blood stained, but in the pull away shot, Crowe wasn't wearing a garment of the same dimensions and he didn't appear to be injured or bleeding. I went back and forth with that one until I decided it had to be an error in filming or editing, but it certainly was a head scratcher.Anyway, this is an intriguing movie as long as you don't let historical accuracy guide you. Or get distracted by the use of elevators to raise soldiers up to ground level of the Coliseum to do battle. What's inspirational is the way Maximus earned the loyalty of his fellow warrior prisoners and their dedication to fight in strength and honor under impossible circumstances.","

"Gladiator","gavin6942","18 November 2014","When a Roman general (Russell Crowe) is betrayed and his family murdered by an emperor's corrupt son (Joaquin Phoenix), he comes to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge.The music is very much like that for the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series, which should not be surprising given that both come from Hans Zimmer. Did he recycle the music here for ""Pirates"", or is it just a similar style? Hmm.This is the film that really made Russell Crowe an international star, and helped him earn an Oscar (though it probably should have gone to Geoffrey Rush). This is also probably the best film from Ridley Scott since ""Blade Runner"". While on first viewing it may not seem like anything special, it really does present a great telling of Rome and its problems (fictionalized) and could have parallels to empires today.","

"Gladiator","MikeG-1221","26 August 2001","A rousing story of one man surviving adversity and destroying a corrupt man in the process, Gladiator is a very entertaining 2 1/2 hour ride. The best part of the movie is the backdrop itself, for which Ridley Scott aggressively takes the moviegoer on a trip throughout all corners of the Roman Empire, and even to their concept of heaven in the process. Definitely worth the money, and I'm sorry that I didn't get to see it on the big screen.I was disturbed, however, by the historical liberties taken with the script. For those of you who don't care about this sort of thing, please stop reading now.OK, first of all, Marcus Aurelius died of the plague, which would have been pretty hard for Commodious to fake if he had killed his father. 2nd, Commodius lived for 12 years (180-192 A.D.) so his quick rise and fall doesn't really jibe historically either (he died in a wrestling match). Also, he was known for his physical strength, so his wimpiness in the movie really didn't make sense.These items, taken alone, bother me a little, but then there are more disturbing factors to take into account. For one, soldiers weren't allowed BY LAW to get married, so all of Maximus' talk of ""going home to see his wife"" really doesn't make sense. Soldiers did keep women on nearby plots of land, but they probably wouldn't talk openly about it. Also, Rome was in a defensive posture; most of the lands they had acquired they acquired BEFORE Marcus Aurelius came to power.I think what bothers me the most is the fact that Marcus Aurelius was no hero. He was renowned for persecuting Christians; he stepped up efforts during his regime, believing that Christianity would be the death of the empire. While he did do some very good things for the empire, he wasn't the benevolent patriarch that the movie made him out to be. He also tried to marry his nephew to his daughter so they would produce a ""super emperor""; my guess is that he probably didn't want Rome to be a Republic again.Revisionist history is troublesome. Although this did happen nearly 2 millennia ago, we still can't forget that the emperors of the day were not heroes by today's standards. I'm not one of those politically correct people who thinks that movies about despots shouldn't be made. I simply believe that historical figures should be presented honestly for what they did (and didn't do), and not sugarcoated for a mass audience.Having said all that, I really did like the movie. I give it an 8/10, with the disclaimer that it's no Braveheart, but it is visually stunning and hard to look away from while you're watching it, but not a movie that really will affect me for months after seeing it.","

"Gladiator","bluzman","25 February 2001","Gladiator is well-made and sports all the frills of a big budget production -- big sets and lotsa extras in good costumery.  However, let's be blunt, it is a 10-minute plot stretched out to epic proportions.  And, it is not a new plot.  It is not much more than a combination of Braveheart and Last of the Mohicans, go to Rome -- to name a couple of more recent films. In effect, it is hero gets done wrong and his loved ones are killed, so he bides his time and gets his revenge. I think all of the hurrah behind this film is from Hollywood having little else to offer this year at the Oscars (how else could Chocolat get nominated --$$$). Since Crouching Tiger is not part of the good ole boy Hollywood network, Hollywood is working hard to prevent a foreign film from upstaging them. In a different year, this film would not get half the recognition it is getting.","

"Gladiator","MovieAddict2016","20 October 2003","I originally saw ""Gladiator"" (2000) in the year of its release, and after seeing the movie again last night, my position on the film has not changed. I did not like it three years ago, and I still do not like it. Back then I was not reviewing on a professional basis--in fact, I had just started submitting comment/recommendation reviews on the Internet Movie Database. I gave ""Gladiator"" a bad comment and moved on. Now I can criticize it a bit deeper.""Gladiator"" stars Russell Crowe as Maximus, a Roman soldier who conquers in practically any and every battle. Caesar (Richard Harris) likes Maximus, and so he decides to give the throne to him after he dies and not to his immoral and irresponsible son (Joaquin Phoenix, who played Merrill in ""Signs,"" a much better movie).However, when Caesar's plans are revealed to his son, he murders his father and takes his place as Caesar, commanding Maximus to be taken out into the woods to be murdered. However, Maximus, being the great soldier that he is, escapes and flees back home to his wife and child--only to find them burned alive and hanging dead outside the house.Maximus eventually comes into custody and is thrown in a gladiatorial arena, where he becomes the main star, killing and conquering in every battle. Soon he is like a modern day baseball player--fans line up outside the Colosseum just to see him before the battles begin.Soon the new Caesar finds out who the great gladiator really is, and so turmoil begins. The new Caesar's sister (Connie Nielsen) once loved Maximus, so that is thrown in for good measure, too. While we're at it, let's throw in some futuristic battleships, robots and space aliens that Maximus can fight in the sequel, when he comes back from the dead. (And I'm not kidding about the following--a prequel is planned.)The movie is slow, and when it picks up speed it goes nowhere. It seems like a rip-off of ""Braveheart"" from beginning to end--a soldier's family is murdered and he takes revenge on the man/nation who killed them by fighting. Granted, he has no choice but to fight in ""Gladiator,"" but still...The movie was directed by Ridley Scott, the Englishman who directed ""Alien,"" ""Blade Runner"" and, among more recent films, ""Matchstick Men."" He's a talented director with an eye for atmosphere, but his films don't always work because sometimes his atmosphere gets the better of him--like in ""Gladiator."" The surroundings are dull, bleak and heartless. ""Braveheart"" had some ounce of beautiful settings, and Mel Gibson used long, wide lens shots of Scotland. Here we just get what we are presented with. And when the camera does pull back to give us the full picture, it's usually packed with very bad CGI effects of Colosseums and such.And Russell Crowe. How did he ever win (and I do mean it when I say ""win"") an Oscar for this mess? He delivers every line with the same monotone deadness in his voice as thirty minutes earlier in the film. He is and remains one of my least favorite actors, both on and off the screen. And if he wants to beat me up for saying mean things about him (as he usually does to people), he can just come over to my house and try. The greasy-haired baboon.The dialogue in the movie. Oh my! Things are said that you expect to read in a letter from a six-year-old to his/her parents. (I was just waiting to hear, ""My family is dead. I am sad."")To be honest, there were a few good moments in ""Gladiator."" It has some impressive fight scenes, including one with two men fighting while tigers leap out of cages built underneath the sand of the arena floor and lunge for the battling duo. I must say that I came close to recommending the movie at certain times. But then it would slow down its pace again and turn into some sort of large-budget cornball. I understand that many people love this movie. Give me ""Braveheart"" any day.2.5/5 stars.John Ulmer","

"Gladiator","paulclaassen","2 February 2021","'Gladiator' is a spectacle of note and a film everyone should see at least once. Jealousy, ambition, greed, betrayal, loyalty, and vengeance are all so well illustrated here. It is an excellent script and very well executed.Russell Crowe is good as Maximus, a man who lost everything in the blink of an eye. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the antagonist, Commodus. Commodus is the epitome of a true villain. You will hate him. The film features all round good performances from a seasoned cast.Despite the film's long running time, it is never boring. From the impressive opening battle scene to the climatic finale, it is action and intrigue all the way. However, due to the film's theme, there's a lot of bloody and violent killings, hence the film can be grim and depressing at times.Ultimately, though, 'Gladiator' is a fantastic tale of vengeance. The photography is beautiful and the sweeping score is filled with so much emotion. Despite plenty of brutality, 'Gladiator' is still an absolutely beautiful film.","

"Gladiator","GnrlGrnt","4 August 2000","How has Ridley Scott pulled the veil over everyone's eyes?  The camera-work in the first battle scene is disorienting and intentionally blurry to avoid showing anything in detail.  The dialogue, from start to finish, is unrealistic- both on a human level and a Roman level.  If you want to incorporate historical figures into a fictionalized account, treat them as historical figures, not perversions of historical figures with the same names.  Marcus Aurelius was not a 2000 year-too-early Thomas Jefferson. Whatever Hellenistic notions of democracy the Greeks held to, the Romans repudiated until the disintegration of their empire.  I laughed awkwardly (to mask my offense and disbelief) when Aurelius lets his daughter know what an impressive ""Caesar she would have made had she been born a man.""  What utter nonsense!  Furthermore, the character of Commodus is not so much miscast as it is botched in the person of Joaquin Phoenix.  Russell Crowe acquits himself nicely in his performance as Maximus, but is his story of revenge really that sympathetic?    The computer generated Rome is impressive, but not even on a par with the Rome of Julie Taymor's recent ""Titus.""  And what is this odd, recurring cornball shot of Maximus parallel to the ground as the grass moves under him?  The production value of Gladiator is high (at times), but someone should've hired a proofreader and BS detector.","

"Gladiator","ElMaruecan82","30 April 2017","In 2003, the American Film Institute presented the Top 100 Screen-Characters, fifty each in the hero and villain category, with the fiftieth spots belonging to the most recent characters: Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) from ""Training Day"" was the last bad guy and in the heroic department: General Maximum Decimus Meridius, Russel Crowe as the titular 'Gladiator'. His reputation outgrew ""Training Day"" and deservedly so, as the film not only resurrected the 'swords and sandals' genre but a new trend of spectacular entertainment that defined film-making of the new millennium.Like Jesus Christ in the Antiquity timing, there would be a before and an after ""Gladiator"" and like Caesar, one's got to give Ridley Scott the credit he deserves. He didn't use CGI for the sake of special effects but for storytelling, it was still the post-""Titanic"" era where CGI was used for the sinking, but the rest was made of flesh, props and bones, ""The Phantom Menace"" had CGI as vital as the actors, maybe more, but Scott used them to recreate the Coliseum, to make the cheerful crowds look real, to transport us into a universe that had deserted screens ever since the 60's: Antique Rome, as if its historical fall had spread to Hollywood. The use of CGI isn't perfect but it is the job of the story to distract your eyes and mind so that you won't try to spot the flaw, and speaking for myself, I was so enthralled by the story that I didn't even want to spot any flaw.Indeed, the real power of ""Gladiator"" is in the story, one of disconcerting simplicity, whose pitch could take indeed the time of an elevator ride but the treatment and the performances enrich it with a Shakespearian texture. You can say it's a story of an ambitious son who kills his father, Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) to prevent him from restoring the power to the people, but the performance of Joaquin Phoenix is of a dark, brooding and twisted man who can't stand the paternal rejection and surrenders to the reality of his own wickedness and commits the irreparable act. You can almost feel Commodus killing a part of himself with his father, the only shade of goodness left in his heart. If he can't rule because he's too amoral, so be it, and let's start a descent that will go as far as turning the victor of the Barbarians into a mortal enemy.Yes, I started with the villain, but it's the villain that gives its flavor to the film, and Commodus encompasses such a high degree of corruption that he inevitably highlights the straight morality of Maximus, his father's most faithful lieutenant, the son he wished he had. Oscar-winning Russell Crowe plays the general with enough depth and passion to be as believable as Mel Gibson when he played William Wallace (Gibson was the initial choice) but the real power of Crowe is to keep a low profile, never overplay the heroism figure, he's a man not guided by power or ambitions, freed from any corrupting torment, his only wish is to get back to his home near Trujillo. His moral 'cleanness' creates the perfect balance with a villain whose mind is clouded by hatred, Maximus seems ""one-dimensional"" because we relate to him as a good father and a good son while we're more captivated by the back-story of Commodus. The Emperor's last line ""your faults as a son are my failure as a father"" are the kind of lines Shakespeare might have been proud to write.There are elements of ""Julius Caesar"" and ""Spartacus"" but the resulting mix is unique and a standalone classic served by powerful performances, Connie Nielsen is the sister of Commodus and Maximus' previous mistress, and Oliver Reed makes his final performance as Proximo, the slave merchant and former gladiator who starts to respect Maximus as he realizes his value and encourages him to ""win the crowd"" as the only way to earn his freedom. Maximus couldn't care much about freedom, his only wish is to avenge his family and join them in the afterlife, a secret he shares with his fellow slave, a Numidian played by Djimon Hounsou. The films covers many layers from spectacular entertainment to its arousing story and while not being totally accurate, it is engaging in every department and captures the essence of movies as an art of storytelling and spectacle, using special effects, even to recreate a heart-pounding fight with a tiger, something meant not to be noticed.And all the special effects of the world wouldn't have a point if we didn't care for the characters in the first place.The film is known for having been severely bashed by Roger Ebert himself, I read his review and I got some of his points about the fuzzy and muddy look, and yes, there might have a few abuse of the bluish American light, but there's a scene that can summarize my feeling. When Maximus is encouraged by the crowd to kill one of the gladiator, he's popular already, he earns the respect of the crowd but when he spares the fighter, there's a hesitation, some of the audience boos but it then turns into cheers again as he's called ""Maximus the Merciful"".When you win the crowd, whatever you do will look good, I guess whatever Scott did could pass, his film, along with the Best Picture Oscar of the year, had won the crowd as well, and deserves a special nod as one of the most defining and influential movies of the 2000's. Or well, let's just say ""I was entertained"" to the point I didn't want to spot any visual flaw. That's how good it is.","

"Gladiator","harrylosborne","31 March 2019","Gladiator is the prime example of filmmaking at its best: massive set pieces, honest acting, and a plot to back up the gravity of the scenes. Moving from the forests of Germany and the fighting pits of Zucchabar, before culminating in the Colosseum of Rome, Scott's historical epic flows seamlessly. Russell Crowe gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the grizzled but vengeful Maximus, plotting a course back to the Emperor Commodus (equally brilliantly played by Joaquin Phoenix). The fighting pits emulate the unrest within the capital, as discord grows between the emperor and the Senate.Fighting scenes are appropriately epic: realistic imagery and brutal military style are on full show, accentuated by the devotion paid to the costume design of the film. Hans Zimmer is, as usual, perfect in scoring the film, adding both a solemness to darker scenes, whilst capturing the heat of battle when required. The fine acting is merely the icing on the cake. Not a wrong step is taken, from the leads down to the more minor roles (a personal favourite is Djimon Hounsou as Maximus' gladiatorial ally Juba).Gladiator comes together perfectly in all facets of film - there is a perfectly good reason this is such a highly acclaimed film, and for all the right reasons. Ridley Scott has earned his reputation here.","

"Gladiator","Mendelovich","29 December 2000","This movie is so well done, that you are overwhelmed. I can frankly say that there is not even a single boring moment during the whole length. I will begin my description with the shooting. The movie has such great shots, that you will be truly impressed. There wasn't any saving made by the producers with the staging of the scenery. It has been set to resemble perfectly the Roman times. The fighting scenes in the gladiator's arena are shocking, but tastefully done. Actually, the movie begins with a battle between a Roman legion and a German tribe's army. Great shots! It is much better than the fights in Braveheart. The other impressive side of the movie is the consistency of the plot. The movie has a coherent plot which sends us a clear picture of the happenings, without limiting the suspension. You cannot guess the end of the movie at all, and neither the next step, but as it happens it is logic. The last but not least is Crowe's acting. I have never heard about this actor until this movie, but he plays very well. He is manly and sensitive altogether. I commend its casting, when other candidates were more known. You just have to see this movie, and you will be convinced that the great epic era of the fifties was finally reproduced and surpassed.","

"Gladiator","pzanardo","23 January 2002","Let's forget ""Gladiator"" won the Oscar for the best film: even worse things may happen. As a matter of fact, the movie contains uncountable mistakes and flaws on Roman history and ancient life in general. Some examples follow.
The gladiators were almost NEVER killed in the arena. That's clear: they were too important for the show business, and it costed too much money to train a gladiator to have him murdered. Their fights followed strict rules, nothing to do with the absurd slaughters shown in the movie.
A Roman Citizen by no means could be made slave, as it happens to Maximus in the movie. If sentenced by the Emperor, he could be killed by anybody, but neither made slave nor tortured. That's the reason why Saint Paul was be-headed and not crucified. And the fact that Maximus uses his long sword (Romans had no long swords) with two hands in a Samurai-like style is just too ridiculous to deserve comments.The Roman army in battle followed a scientific strategy, with tight lines of troops protected by their shields, an established sequence of attacks and retreats, and so on. The battle at the beginning of the movie is an over-confused, poorly photographed brawl. The camp of the Roman Legion was a perfect square, with a strong palisade, and the tents of all ranks were neatly divided inside it. Nothing to do with the messy camping in the forest shown in the film.""Gladiator"" won an Oscar for the best costumes, too. Well, I think that Oakland Raiders fans wear nicer and more realistic costumes. In particular, the armours and weapons in the movie are unbelievably mistaken: most of them first appeared some 800 years later than the epoch of the story.But let's forget about Roman History, and say that ""Gladiator"" is either fantasy, or science-fiction, or something like that. Nonetheless, it remains a very ugly movie. The story is boring and utterly predictable. For instance, the whole episode of Maximus' attempted escape can be fore-seen almost second by second. Maximus returns home and finds his house wasted and his family destroyed... a strikingly original idea... perhaps already seen in dozens of western movies! By the way, Maximus goes from Germany to southern Spain (say 1500 miles?), pursued, with no food. How long did this pleasant journey last? Two months? And what about the gangrenous wound, later healed by a fellow gladiator? Come on! And the repeated wanna-be-touching oneiric scene with the hand and the wheat is clumsy and far-fetched.The action scenes are confused and badly filmed. The violence is so excessive to become ridiculous. The script is awful. The cinematography is generally very poor. Large use of close-ups like in a TV-movie, extremely brief choral scenes. Why? Perhaps in order that the viewer doesn't notice the computer tricks? The fight which closes the movie is by far less spectacular than all other arena scenes: I think this is an enormous mistake for an action flick. Something to save in ""Gladiator""? The bucks it has made.","

"Gladiator","zkonedog","5 March 2017","For all you really avid movie-watchers out there, think about this question for a minute: Have you ever seen a movie starring Russell Crowe where you said ""that was really bad?"". I didn't think so either.For a basic plot summary, ""Gladiator"" tells the story of Maximus (Crowe), one-time member of the Roman army turned gladiator slave at the hands of tyrant ruler Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). While fighting all that the Colosseum can throw at him, Maximus must also inspire a revolution to return Rome to its former glory.Despite starting off quite slow for the first 30-40 minutes, ""Gladiator"" quickly becomes top- notch drama primarily because of the simmering intensity Crowe brings to his role. Without his presence in this film, I cannot think of another actor who could have turned in such a nuanced, show-carrying performance. His gravitas on screen carries itself almost without dialogue whatsoever.This is also the kind of film (much like Crowe's later work ""Robin Hood"") that is quite long but only builds on itself. It takes some time for the real drama to really kick in, but when it does it is all the more pertinent because of the character development we have already seen.Overall, ""Gladiator"" is a great movie that has a little something for everyone. If you like historical fiction, battle scenes, drama, or incredible acting, than this film will capture your interest for a full two and half hours. I can easily see why it cleaned up at the Academy Awards in 2001.","

"Gladiator","Figgiedan","19 May 2000","Ridley Scott has made a real loser. The first third of the movie was tedious - the one battle at the beginning was so messy you couldn't tell what the hell was going on -- ok the horrors of war show that it's crazy and Ridley Scott was trying to make the viewer feel as disoriented as the film's hero -- guess what? It was done better in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and at least in that film you can SEE the fellow soldiers falling around the main character. One ripoff from a film. Also check out how close it comes to ""Braveheart"" in parts --- ""Say, William Wallace is visited by the young queen while in a cell in ""Braveheart"" and that was cool - let's have Maximus visted by the daughter of the king and conspire against her brother just like the young French Queen conspired against King Longshanks in ""Braveheart."" Plus in ""Braveheart"" there's cool battle scenes, let's try that too. Not to mention the obvious, Russell Crowe sure as hell sounds like Mel Gibson, the only difference is he is so miserable in this film and there is no real heroic character development like with Gibson. When his family is killed at the end of the first act, the moral is that Hollywood truism, ""behind every good man is a dead woman and/or child."" It does pick up after that though. The best part in the film was the 2nd act after he's picked up by Oliver Reed and thrown in as a Gladiator - but even here the battle scenes are too messy and you can't tell what the hell is going on - at one point a Legionaire is cut in half by what I thought was only a wooden stick on the chariot - I had to be explained that ""it must've been a blade"" by my companion who came with me to the film. Now that I think about it, we were asking each other what the hell was going on a number of times, mostly due to the jerky camera shots and the loud noises over whispered dialogue. And I never talk during a film. The ending was ludicrous the ""go home Maximus"" and the ""Lucius is safe"" dialogue made me roll my eyes. There was little to no historical value to the film and Rome was pretty damn boring - plus 5 shots of the same part of the ""majestic collosium"" only verified that it was a CGI-generated shot. Christ, even the CGI birds were splotches on the screen...Anyway, there are a few things that were ok - Reed and Crowe were pretty good. Phoenix was ok as the ""unloved by daddy"" emperor. The actress Connie Neilsen who played Lucilla was pretty good and well as Maximus' two ""buddy"" Gladiators. In short, a lousy script, well-acted but 2-dimensional characters, and messy camera shots made this only another film that disappointed me. A 6.5 out of 10 (D) --- Go watch any bit of ""Spartacus,"" two scenes from ""Braveheart,"" and the first 15 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan."" You'll have the same damn movie.","

"Gladiator","danielll_rs","26 May 2000","Rating: ***1/2 out of ****WARNING: SOME THINGS HERE CAN BE CONSIDERED SPOILERSI like art-house films. I really do. OK, some of them are really dull and boring, but can you complain of Almodovar's and Buñuel's pictures, or the Kielowski trilogy of colors? I can't. I also like very much films that stay in the middle- are not simply artistic or simply entertaining: ""Magnolia"" (last year's best, by the way), ""American Beauty"", ""2001"". But for every ""That Obscure Object of Desire"" there's a ""Gladiator"". Not that ""Gladiator"" is empty (it talks about honor, courage, revenge), but its aim is to entertain audiences. So what? Let's have fun with it!As every $100+ million budget movie, ""Gladiator"" is visually stunning and perfectly done and executed. The visuals are so great, vibrating and realistic that we feel we are in the ancient Rome of emperors and gladiators. After so many boring and dull films (""1492""- a joy to our eyes but empty as a hollow piece of wood- and ""G.I. Jane""- that I, personally, felt ashamed to watch), Ridley Scott comes back with all his strength. It may be a little early, but he deserves a best director nomination at next year's Oscar. The way he recreates battle scenes and fight sequences in the Coliseum is amazing, almost unbelievable. My biggest disappointment with Luc Besson's ""The Messenger"" was the way he directed the battle scenes. It was the same thing of seeing a tomato being cut in slices, with Milla Jovovich yelling in the background. In ""Gladiator"" it's just the opposite. There's a battle scene in Germania. Only one, but it's so real, bitter, the best since ""Saving Private Ryan"". Thumbs up for you, Mr. Scott! Resurrect the old Rome is not for everyone, nor resurrect the epic genre, which was dead since... I don't know, for a long time. Believe it or not, ""Gladiator"" can be put on the same level of ""Spartacus"" or ""Ben-Hur"". May the epic genre stay with us and go on like this!One of the greatest merits of ""Gladiator"" (and also where its flaws are) is its screenplay. The film has 2 hours and a half, but I didn't feel it that long. I'm not against long picture (see ""Magnolia""), but entertaining films can't be boring. Well, there are slow moments in the film here and there- and that's the only visible flaw I can see. But, taking this, the screenplay is a joy. The characters have a good development, their lines are well written and the situations are emotional and intriguing. The cast just helps to keep our interest. Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen, who I think would be real problems for me, give solid performances. He is Commodus, son of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), who kills the own father to get the throne. Summarizing, the villain. Phoenix is surprising and sometimes haunting. Nielsen is pretty and strong as Lucilla, Commodus' sister and object of his incestuous desire. But Russell Crowe is the big star here. He is Maximus, a general of Marcus Aurelius' troop. The emperor is old and weak, and promises him the throne. Knowing this, Commodus kills his father and orders his soldiers to kill Maximus and his family. He escapes, but his wife and son die. He becomes a slave, but starts to show his talent of fighting. He is sent to Rome as a gladiator, looking for revenge against Commodus. Everything will be solved in the final scenes, which reminded me ""Hamlet"" for some reason- and will make some people cry. But let's talk about Crowe. After terrific performances in ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""The Insider"", he can receive his second Oscar nod with justice. He builds Maximus as a brave, strong, but also heartfelt man. Thumbs up for him too!Talking about 'thumbs-up', everything in ""Gladiator"" deserves this. It's not an unforgettable masterpiece, but I won't be angry if it becomes a classic. It delivers solid entertainment and has a strong dramatic side. What else do we need?","

"Gladiator","pyrocitor","16 March 2005","Few films deserve the title 'Masterpiece'. Being able to capture the emotional impact, dramatic force and all around power of what we would consider a masterpiece is simply beyond most films that make their ways to the cinema these days. I think it's fair to say the Gladiator is one of the very few films that does not fall short of expectations. Instead, it easily surmounts them, drawing the viewer in, and forcing out of them every possible emotion by it's sheer power. We can't help but cheer when Maximus strikes down yet another foe in the arena, we can't help but boo and groan with malcontent as the purely evil Commodus (there's no other way to put it) plans his next scheme. Gladiator manipulates our emotions in a way that is fantastic to behold - Hans Zimmer's beautiful and majestic score keeps the mood flowing, and the simple story is brought up by the sheer scope of the production and the incredible performances driving the film.It's been said so many times by now, but Russell Crowe is nothing less than magnificent, easily deserving his Academy Award for his performance. His stunning performance drives the film, and keeps the audience engaged throughout - never once can we take our eyes off him, or be drawn out of the incredible story he draws us into. Joaquin Phoenix, playing Maximus' nemesis, the scheming Commodus, is stunning. The sheer evil he exudes must be applauded, as his paranoid, arrogant, power-hungry dictator is slowly but steadily forced out of the favor of the people by Maximus is breathtaking. We develop a genuine hatred for Commodus, and openly cheer whenever Maximus wins public favor over him. Few villains have matched Phoenix's ability to be genuinely vile to the core. Connie Nielson is also terrific as Commodus' strong-willed but fearful sister, living in a web of apprehension once her brother takes power over Rome. Oliver Reed, sadly in his last performance, is great as Proximo, the slave dealer, who as Maximus puts it, is ""in danger of becoming a good man"". Djimon Hounsou is wonderful as Maximus' loyal fellow slave and gladiator, and Richard Harris is a strong presence as Marcus Aurelius, the previous emperor of Rome, slain by Commodus' murderous ambition.I am hard pressed to find any flaw with Gladiator. It excels in every possible area - wonderful set and costume design, a superb musical score, top notch performances, and an overall sense of power which cannot help but draw you in, and let the viewer witness the majesty firsthand. Are you not entertained? At the very least, you should be.-10/10","

"Gladiator","zardoz-13","9 December 2009","Suffering through ""Gladiator,"" director Ridley Scott's long-winded and sloppily staged Roman soldier epic, whetted my appetite for those glorious sword and sandal sagas that Hollywood produced in the 1950s and the 1960s. Guts, gusto, and grandeur distinguished spectacles such as Melvyn Leroy's ""Quo Vadis"" (1951), Delmar Daves' ""Demetrius and the Gladiators"" (1954), William Wyler's ""Ben-Hur"" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus"" (1960), and Anthony Mann's ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" (1964). Although it borrows bits and pieces from those cinematic classics, ""Gladiator"" lacks the passion and charisma which made those movies memorable. Meticulously crafted with stunning, state-of-the-art, digital special effects that recreate ancient Rome, ""Gladiator"" chronicles the tragic fate of a valiant general betrayed and enslaved, who returns as a gladiator to wreak vengeance on a wicked emperorWhile brawny Russell Crowe gives a thumbs-up performance, he is defeated by a thumbs-down script that resembles an uninspired rehash of the Clint Eastwood classic ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" in a toga with a chicken-hearted villain and a humdrum finale. The action unfolds in Germania in 180 A.D. General Maximus (Russell Crowe of ""The Insider"") wins a brutal battle for his dying emperor, Caesar Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris of ""Unforgiven""), against a Danubian horde. Caesar despises his depraved son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix of ""Clay Pigeons"") and makes Maximus the protector of Rome. Marcus wants Rome returned to the people and he trust Maximus and Maximus only to make this happen. When Commodus learns the bad news, he suffocates his dear old dad in his tent. At Marcus Aurelius' death bed, Maximus defies Commodus and vows to carry out his late emperor's wishes. Swiftly, Commodus has Maximus arrested and taken out to be executed at dawn. Predictably, Maximus outsmarts his moronic captors and escapes. Riding hard for his sprawling farm in faraway Spain, Maximus arrives too late to save his crucified wife and son. Grief-stricken, he falls prey to a band of slave traders who eventually sell him to Proximo (Oliver Reed of ""Hannibal Brooks""). Not only does Proximo teach Maximus how to survive in the arena, but also how to win the kudos of the crowd.Meanwhile, honoring his father whom he murdered, Commodus revives the gladiator battles in the Coliseum. Proximo shows up with his invincible champion and Commodus gets the shock of his life when he discovers that Maximus is alive. The cheering crowds adore Maximus in the area so the corrupt Commodus plots to kill him outside it.Director Ridley Scott of ""Alien"" gums up ""Gladiator"" with a soap opera subplot about the incest between Commodus and his sister. The ""Braveheart"" style battle that opens the movie is so murky that you can barely see the combatants. The actors in the sun-drenched fights are better, but Scott dwells more on clashing swords rather than hair-raising choreography. Sadly, Commodus makes such a weak, sniveling villain that you feel no relief when Maximus squares accounts with him. Ultimately, as colorless as the statues of the Roman rules, who adorn the palaces in this bloody bore of a blockbuster, ""Gladiator"" qualifies as a bust.","

"Gladiator","C22Man","30 June 2016","Gladiator should be the type of film that I enjoy. Ridley Scott taking on something much grander than anything he had previously. A cast of fine actors led by Russell Crowe. A return to the sword-and- sandal epics of years gone by. It's a film of fine visual finesse, engaging action sequences and large themes. So why is it that Gladiator left me feeling so cold? Well it falls flat in its two most important areas, story and characters.It follows the gruff general Maximus who is named protector of Rome by Marcus Aurelius, that is until Aurelius is murdered by his own son Commodus who has Maximus exiled and his family killed. From here you can see exactly where the film is going. Maximus finds himself as a slave and is sold to a gladiator trainer named Proximo (played by the always great Oliver Reed) who wants to take him to Rome and help him fight his way to the top. This story is about as basic and clichéd as humanly possible. The hero is betrayed and fights his way back in order to get his revenge. That is effectively the main premise of the film. For such simplicity to work the film has to either add twists to the story or be incredible detailed, yet it does neither.The story also contains a weirdly handled sub-plot about Commodus trying to crush the senate who are constantly attempting to make him tackle real issues instead of hosting games. This could have been a decent side story but it's never fleshed out enough to leave an impact. Involved in basically every story thread is Commodus' sister Lucilla, who he also happens to want a child with (yes, he's that kind of kooky), and she becomes a plot device to link all of these pieces together. Joaquin Phoenix hams it up big time as Commodus and to be fair he is clearly meant to be a pantomime villain and Phoenix is probably the only person having fun in the entire film. Connie Nielsen deserves credit too for holding her own despite her incredibly underwritten character.Of course when Maximus and his gladiators get to Rome, they smash through all that stand in their way leading to the crowd turning over to Maximus' side and an inevitable confrontation with Commodus. How Russell Crowe won an Oscar for his performance is a mystery. Crowe himself is fine, but the role is as basic tough guy as it comes and anyone with a bit of muscle could have played the role as it is. Maximus is simply a poor leading character. He's just dour and dull as a rock for the entirety of the film, even before his family are killed off. What's is also notable is that the character doesn't grow. He's a bland, unsympathetic slab from the get-go who just becomes slight more revenge-fuelled as things progress. How can we empathise with this type of main character?Clearing those obstacles, I have little problems with the film on a technical level. It's Ridley Scott so you know the film with be very detailed and beautiful on a visual level and that is exactly what we get. Rome looks magnificent. Vast, majestic and full of people, whilst even the CGI is impressive and manages to blend in seamlessly. The film has an almost dirty brown, hazy look to it that actually works to its advantage. It fits the sullen mood that many of the gladiator's find themselves in. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard provide a score that feels like it's been ripped off by every action movie since it, especially the pieces where Gerrard appears to be singing in a made up language.The action scenes are a highlight. There is a grittiness to them that works for this time period. They not that well-choreographed and I thing that ways purposefully done, in order the show how many of the gladiators were fighting by using sheer aggression and desperation. Every stabbing or wounding looks and sounds painful and not in an overblown or unnatural way. The Coliseum looks fabulous and the films gets across the intimidating atmosphere of having to fight in there. I do have problems with how easily Maximus rises to the top, seeing as he's able to lead the gladiators through tough battles and defeat the only undefeated gladiators with relative ease. Then the climax eventually boils down to Maximus v Commodus and its entirely predictable and just a boring way to end.What is notable is that Gladiator didn't affect me on an emotional level at all. Even comparable epics like 'Braveheart', which shares similar issues, moved me. Gladiator left me numb. I didn't care about Maximus' plight because I was just given a shell of a character to try and get behind. I wasn't engaged in the story because it was simply a downbeat repeat of a storyline that has been done to death. I didn't even care on a basic level to see the villain get his comeuppance. All the talks of political treachery, what it means to be a gladiator and of meeting again in the afterlife just seemed like pieces to fill the film out. I can't deny that the film is a technical marvel or say that it bored me, but I can state that is built upon a story and set of characters that are wholly uninteresting.","

"Gladiator","jimberg","13 June 2001","Firstly, Romans never referred to the Colloseum as the ""Colloseum"".  It was called the Flavian Amphitheatre.Commodus was an actual emperor who ruled from A.D. 180 to 192.  He did indeed fight in the Colloseum against gladiators, and was quite good at it because he never lost (Maybe he cheated like in the movie).His sister, Lucilla, did conspire with his wife Crispina to have him killed. They were caught and banished to an island and later killed.His mistress Marcia tried to drug him to death but failed, so they had some athlete strangle him to death.  He died on New Year's Eve A.D. 192.He was a nut case, and was quite murderous, but that's about the only things real about the movie.Other than the historical problems, the story was great.  I liked Maximus and really hated Commodus.  It was your basic struggle between good and evil.","

My dad never let me because it was rated r and I wasn't old enough. i finally turned 15 and he let me watch it. Very very good movie. If only my dad let me watch it unedited with all the violence it probably would be even better. I keep telling my dad I can handle the violence and I am not a scared little boy, and he edited out like all of the bloody fighting. And what is crazy is that we watched The Patriot (2000) and he edited like nothing. We saw almost everything from that movie. Ive heard that movie was more violent than this one. Whatever.
I still loved it even though almost all of the violence was cut out from my dad. The plot was really good and the quotes are really memorable. Can't wait till im older and I leave my dads house and watch this with all the violence. But till then i will have to say this was a great movie even though it would probably be better with the violence","

"Gladiator","jiefengf","2 September 2020","A classic movie successfully portrays a set of intensive characters in a relatively simple plot. The macho and valiant hero Maximus played by Crowe a man worshiped by his people. The beautiful and resourceful Lucilla by Nielsen a loving mother and the true continuation of the spirit of her father. And the envious and serpentine Commodus by Phoenix. The delicious portrayal of these characters creates a classical but still rich dynamics that for me is the main dish of this movie.In addition to this classicality of the plot and the characters, I appreciate the slightly heavy stroke on Commodus. This leads us to explore the natural question of what this man of jealousy is thinking. It's a man who yearns for respect and love of his father and his sister, all of which the mighty general has taken away from him. He seeks no power or fortune, but the name, which the enslaved Maximus claims so easily. This extra colour on the character of Commodus is like the shadow of the painting. A minor change, a huge enhancement.The story is complete. As I am not very knowledgable about neither the history of Rome nor the book, for me, the plot is still able to create a noticeable and constant tension that keeps me intrigued till the end. The ending is actually a little surprising, as I expected a realistic ending of tragedy. This ending, while emotionally pleasing, is a bit cliche. But then, the revelation of such ending reminds me that the move is about a poetic story. I don't feel this clicheness deal much damage to my experience to it.The friends Maximus make when enslaved as gladiator are not completely great. I cannot make a clear point on it. But I feel some of the strokes on these characters are not aesthetic enough and their purpose seems too obvious. This breaks the fluency and the naturalness of the story development. These characters should not bear so much personal emotions with Maximus.All in all, a great entertainment. An epic with strong characters. A story simple and beautiful. Flaws are not unnoticeable, but forgivable.","

"Gladiator","blackburnj-1","9 July 2009","Ridley Scott was drawn to direct this project by a painting entitled ""Thumbs down"", which depicted a scene (seen a few times in the film) where a gladiator is sentenced to death by the emperor. It is a moment of pure theatre and that is part of the cinematic appeal of the idea of Rome – an idea which had for forty years or so been ignored. Scott's resulting vision was an epic which has been one of the most influential films of the decade.The story is epic in scope, but powerful in its detail. Maximus, general of the armies of the north, is favoured by the Emperor to become the protector of Rome. The Emperor's son, Commodus, kills his father before this happens and condemns Maximus to death. Maximus escapes execution and flees to his home where he finds his wife and child murdered. He is caught by slave traders and becomes a popular gladiator intent on revenge. The work on the script should not be underestimated as this is an effective story of a man trying to avenge his family and, on some level, get home.Maximus sees Russell Crowe in one of his finest performances. He brings charisma and magnetism to the screen which makes Maximus sympathetic and engaging for both genders: a proper, fully developed character and not just an action hero to be adored by teenage boys. Joaquin Phoenix was underrated as Commodus, bringing to bear insecurity and weakness with a terrifying edge, making him one of the greatest villains of recent years. Richard Harris's appearance is all too brief in this film but is memorable enough to be counted as his last great performance. Oliver Reed meets Crowe's performance stroke for stroke and is a great presence in this film (his performance became noted for being completed with the aid of CGI after his death toward the end of filming).Scott, however, is the real star of this film, making a world as rich and detailed as the one he created in ""Blade Runner"" and delivering a terrific story masterfully. The film looks stunning and has a fine Hans Zimmer score. Once again, the computer effects were another step forward (the Coliseum was largely created by visual effects) and have not dated much in nearly ten years.The film's influence cannot be denied (wheat is now a staple image of otherworldliness) and the decade that has followed has been stuffed with historical epics (""Troy"", ""Alexander"", ""300""), none of which have been as successful or as effective. Its claim to greatness however comes from its ability to satisfy those who had come for story and character and those who came for action and excitement. It is the ultimate blockbuster.","

"Gladiator","tripwires","13 August 2001","I must admit, when I saw the trailer, I thought it was another crap period movie; I didn't like period dramas a lot back then. But after I became a fan of Joaquin Phoenix's, I watched it on a VCD, 5 months after it was released in the theatre. And I truly could not understand why the trailer turned me off so much. Besides Joaquin's brilliant and Oscar-robbed performance as Commodus, Gladiator has all the right ingredients of a spectacular epic, beginning with the opening battle scene. I firmly believe that it is filmed ""shaky"" to convey the confusion and madness in a battle, and not because the guy behind the camera didn't know how to use one. Yes, it contains blood and gore and all that jazz, but do not forget it's a movie about gladiators. Gladiators back then did not sit around, drinking tea and eating sandwiches; they did almost exactly what was depicted in the fights scenes in the film. How else were the film-makers to portray the violence of gladiator fights than to include it in the movie?Another good thing about ""Gladiator"" is that its villain is very much 3-dimensional. I am a big fan of Joaquin Phoenix, and I strongly believe he deserved that Best Supporting Actor Oscar no matter what people say. How often do you get a villain in an action movie who isn't portrayed as entirely bad? Phoenix played Commodus not as a mere villain, but as a spoiled child whose intense search for love drove him to commit deeds he'd later regret (as seen in one of the deleted scenes in the DVD). He gave Commodus a depth that isn't found in most action-movie villain (for example the bad guy in ""Kiss of the Dragon""), and drove the audience into grudging sympathy mixed with loathe. For that alone, he deserves the Oscar.Connie Nielson also deserved some sort of recognition for her underrated performance as Lucilla. She handled her role with great dignity and care; her confliction between her love for her brother that's slowly fading and her duty towards her country is very clearly put across, giving Lucilla the conviction that is certainly needed.Gladiator also has a magnificent score that is, again, Oscar-worthy. The music gives the picture the extra push that sends emotions into overdrive, particularly the **spoiler** Patricide scene, the opening battle scene and the very last scene. The special effects were ASTOUNDING! Just take a look at the Colosseum! Perhaps I'm over-sensitive, but I felt like I was being transported right back to that period.""Gladiator"" is certainly meant to be seen on the big screen. Due to its second release, I had a chance to do just that. And what an experience. Contrary to what some has said, ""Gladiator"" WILL be remembered some ten years from now, simply because it's an epic film about the Roman empire. And a spectacular one at that.","

"Gladiator","PogoNeo","15 December 2016","This picture is epically overrated- it is not the number 46 of the 250 best movies, like the IMDb ratings system states at the time of writing of this review. Because it simply never should have been even near such top 250 list. Aside from a clearly visible big budget, only three things are worth of mentioning: shots of hand brushing thorough stalks of wheat (which are iconic), ""Are you not entertained?!"" shout out moment (of intensive emotions) and the point of story when there is a conspiracy created ""to get him out"" (which in turn leads to a few minutes of enjoyable suspense). Other than that, this picture is quite boring and mediocreIt is suppose to be an epic story, but it does not suck you in on any scale. Instead of that it just epically blows, like if it was a giant blown egg shell- decorated on the outside, but empty on the inside. Even the very first battle in the woods has some stupid visual techniques, with addition of some dog disguised as a wolf saving his master- and what a load of kitsch that was. And the kitsch comes back in epic size at the grand finale- the only missing thing at that point is a group of gladiators singing ""Kumbaya"" to the crowd of cheering and crying spectatorsIn this picture even the music is way below expectations. Yes, there are some good moments, but overall in the beginning and at the end the music is rather weak, while in the middle it is somewhat without a taste or noticeable substance. And what is more, the Wikipedia says that Hans Zimmer took some of this music from Gustav Holst and Richard Wagner. But there is more to it- most likely he also borrows from Henryk Gorecki. And on top of that, some tracks sound like a reworked version of music from ""The Rock"" [1996]"", which Hans Zimmer co-composed; and also there is a musical motive in the ""Gladiator"" that he later on simply reused for the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" movie series. But what is the most disturbing in regards to the score is the fact, that he got nominated for that work by Academy Awards, while the co-composer Lisa Gerrard did not. So it is just ridiculous that the music which is at best mediocre got nominated, but at the same time it is scandalous, that only the man of the two persons that created it received such nomination. (Of course all those Oscars prizes for music / songs should not be viewed as something like some kind of musical Metre Convention agreements)But what is most important- it does not matter, if you watch this movie in crappy conditions at the time of its release when you are entering your young adulthood, or if you watch it some 15 years later on a good home cinema system when you are an adult. It is still boring and also flat to some extentDo not waste your time on this one. Go watch a ""Spartacus"" (2004) instead- although it is a TV movie and was not intended to play in the same league as Ridley Scott does with his big bucks flicks, that ""Spartacus"" beats the ""Gladiator"" almost to the ground (but also in no way constitutes as one of the 250 greatest movies ever made)","

"Gladiator","oli_rawlings","28 October 2005","Their are no words to describe this grand historic epic. Gladiator is a film everybody would enjoy, for it has a great story, great action and superb acting (no wonder Crowe got an Oscar!) Gladiator recounts the story of one of the greatest Roman generals Maximus, who was forced to slavery by the corrupt incestuous heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) who killed Marcus Aurelius the emperor for he knew he offered Maximus power over his own son. Maximus has then become his worst enemy. Commodus having ordered to kill him and his family, Maximus escapes death and as becomes the general who became a slave, the slave who became gladiator, and the gladiator who defied an emperor. Gladiator has some of the most beautiful scenery and CGI effects I have ever seen. IT really is one of the best ""recent"" films out there. The script is also very effective and suiting, and somehow adds a poetic feel to it and so does the superb music used. The actors all did very well in their roles, though Crowe dominated, it is also a memorable performance by Phoenix and Nielsen most memorably and also Hounsou and Harris. Gladiator really does deserve all the awards and nominations it has received. I can assure you, that if you haven't seen this films yet, it should really be the next on your list!","

"Gladiator","smaniatopoulos","8 December 2023","The Gladiator came out in 2000. One year later it would be followed by the Fellowship of the Ring. One year earlier, the Matrix had changed the way we look at scifi. It was a great movie of the rather rare ""historic fantasy"" genre (although at the time it was mislabeled a ""sword and sandal epic"") which has produced a rather limited number of great movies.But the Gladiator, unlike most movies of this genre, remains one of the most beloved Hollywood epics.In hindsight, the reason is obvious: it has Russel Crowe, the greatest rising star of that generation in top form, a form which sadly did not last very long. It has the one and only Ridley Scott going full throttle for the first time since Alien, delivering a visual masterpiece with some of the most iconic scenes of the 21st century, such as the ""hand that caresses the wheat in the field"", a shot that has been copied countless times.It has a great story, which is offensively inaccurate from a historical standpoint but catches the spirit of the devoted hero that falls victim of unethical powers, is betrayed, destroyed but yet he rises up and fulfills his destiny.And of course it has Hans Zimmer, whose soundtrack has become one of the most well known musical themes of all time.The movies was flawed and flawless at the same time, equally grand and inaccurate, epic and engaging, sad and exhilarating. It was a kick ass movie that nailed it.And, maybe above all, it was the most successful movie of a golden era of cinema:
From 1995 to 2005, cinema changed forever: directors broke boundaries in virtually every genre, from scifi (the Matrix) and fantasy (LOTR) to comedy (the Big Lebowski), action (Kill Bill), and drama (Fight club).Hell, even Chinese cinema had joined that great wave of innovative and brave filmmaking with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.The studios could not believe their luck. Veterans, newcomers, new writers, new cinematographers, everyone was at the top of their game, making great movie after great movie.I do not know exactly when this phenomenon started, but it is my firm belief that it was pushed to the forefront by Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.We were reaching the end of the century, a new millenium was about to begin, and suddenly everyone was up for trying something new.Ridley Scott was not new, of course, but the great recognition of his art and the artistic value of Blade Runner had become generally acknowledged only a few years ago, and this realization may have contributed to giving him the chance for a new visual masterpiece, helmed by an Australian newcomer who had only played one big part as supporting actor in a film noir (LA Confidential).Ridley gave it his all, and the Gladiator remains, to this day, his most successful and highest rated movie.Sadly, the wave of innovation did not last as long as it could: it was gradually replaced by the unprecedented success of the superhero movie, which almost destroyed cinema, first by razing the box office and once all the good movies had been made, by trying to outsell competition disguised as a form of social platform for inclusion, diversity, equality, gender rights, and all sorts of activist ideas.20years later, no mainstream studio cares anymore about making art or telling great stories.It's all about making good PR in Hollywood regardless of talent or content.We are now reaching a quarter of a century from the last golden era of cinema.The superhero genre has finally reached its inevitable end. And finally, after almost two decades, an exceptional historical movie (Oppenheimer) and an original concept (Barbie) are in the top-5 grossing movies of the year, while almost half of the new superhero movies have flopped.Let's just hope that we are nearing a new age of cinema, one where the medium can be restored to its former glory.The Gladiator remains, to this day, one of the greatest timeless examples of how cinema can truly enthrall and inspire people, even those who do not necessarily believe in art.","

Plenty of realistic sword fighting duels, compared to most action films anyway, with an immense storyline that makes you passionate about supporting Maximus in avenging his family. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix suit the roles perfectly as hero and villain, with a simple yet effective story that keeps you engaged. There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself. I feel like injured or not, no one in their right mind would've taken the decision to fight him 1 to 1, so for a cunning character, I feel he made an unrealistic decision there, but it did make for a very entertaining finish.","

Jane"", but fortunately he is came back with a success like ""Gladiator"" and a promising title like ""Hannibal"". Even if doesn't absolutely respect history, this movie is a beautiful work and a great wonder for our eyes. Scott directs the battle with great ability, helped by the editing of the great Italian Pietro Scalia (Academy Award winner for ""JFK""): the initial battle in the woods is frenetic and impressive with the force of a thunder and the fights in the arenas are exceptional, a demonstration of what the evolution in movies can do. And also the cast, which sometimes is sacrificed for the show, shows a very great power: Russell Crowe is a suffering but determined Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix an evil, weak and complex Commodus, Connie Nielsen is so beautiful than good actress and then there is a great english trio formed by Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed (dead during the shots). Giorgio Cantarini (Benigni's son in ""La Vita è Bella"") plays the brief role of Maximus' son. We mustn't also forget the red photography by John Mathieson, the rich art direction of Arthur Max (a name, a program) and the wonderful themes composed by Hans Zimmer, featuring the splendid vocals of Lisa Gerrard.

That's the only reasonable explanation I can offer for how he managed to take the Best Actor prize for this.

This is one of those true gems of cinema that stands the test of time like the godfather 1 and 2, alien, alien's, the shawshank redemption, one flew over the cuckoo's nest, psycho, its a wonderful life and so so many more that have that special place reserved in history for film greatness True works of art one and all that resonated with us then and always will.Obviously with the title I made I had to make a mention about Napoleon because it has the same actor, same director but yet comparing the two films is like trying to compare night and day and yes Ridley Scott is now 84, yes they were beholden to mandatory covid restrictions whilst filming Napoleon plus I recenlty learned that the films financiers held both the film and Ridley back and a lot didnt get into the film but I find it astounding how 2 fims that have so many similarities couldn't be further apart.Maybe because of the state of modern day cinema Hollywood doesn't know how to budget because when u take a recent film such as Godzilla minus one with the small budget they made that with and the worldwide praise anf financial success its had. That whole film was made with less money than one episode of she hulk. That is a fact and I know which one I plan on watching coz it's got a monster init and he ain't twerking.I'll save my rant for my Napoleon review but needless to say if Napoleon had only had the vision and the passion of fhis film I think I would have enjoyed it more. But like I said I'll leave that for my Napoleon review.I do believe we will have more films like this. They just very rarely come from Hollywood anymore but I am hopeful for dune 2, but I pretty much focus on foreign cinema and shows these days moslty Korean and indie films because its very rare we get the good old Hollywood blockbusters anymore. But this year we've had John Wick 4, Openheimer and I believe top gun Maverick was this year too so maybe Hollywood's not dead yet but it certainly has more flops than it does successes.Hope everyone's safe and healthy and everyone is having a festive time of the year or enjoying themselves if they don't celebrate Christmas.

It might have been a little better if there had been some gray area.But other than that, it was a really good movie. Since we had just gone to Italy when the movie came out (we went for the millennium jubilee), it made the movie all the neater.

"Gladiator","serafinogm","9 October 2015","Loved this movie but the best sequence was at the beginning when the disciplined, methodical, Roman Army slaughtered a disorganized German horde in a filmed battle sequence with no equal other than perhaps the storming of Normandy beach from Spielberg's movie Saving Private Ryan! Tactics will beat brute force every time! The emperor overseeing this slaughter was Marcus Aurelius who was the last of the adoptive emperors, also referred to as the 'Good Emperors'. It started with Nerva, who adopted Trajan, who in turn adopted Hadrian, who was followed by Antoninus Pius who in turn was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius. During their rule there was a considerable expansion of the Roman empire, from northern Britain to Dacia and to Arabia and Mesopotamia, followed by a consolidation and an attempt to perfect the empire's defenses (e.g. Hadrian's Wall in Britain). This all started to unravel under Commodus (son of Marcus Aurelius). The period of the adoptive emperors started with the assassination of a horrible emperor (Domitian) and ended with another horrible emperor (Commodus who also was assassinated). This is all historical fact and that's the end of the movie's factual content everything else is just fiction! But enjoyable fiction with the formulaic mistake of turning the main protagonist into something of a superhero and that's why it isn't getting a 10!","

"Gladiator","fmbr-1","22 October 2008","There are a couple of reasons I didn't really like Gladiator.First and foremost is Russell Crowe. I'm an Australian and while it seems a little unpatriotic, the guy is pure wood. He is the new Charles Bronson who has one expression and sticks to it.Thus I had a problem when he supposedly 'sells himself to the crowd'. I'm also a wrestling fan and I can only guess that 'selling' must mean something different to the people who made this film. Crowe does no selling here.The other problem I have is some biiiiig holes in the plot. Commodus becomes the new Emperor and sentences Maximus, and his family, to death. Maximus kills the guards and rides as fast as he can for home. So fast he kills both of the horses he rides although he might have been a little faster if the cinematographer didn't decide that he absolutely had to put in some visual effect to boost his career.Anyway, he gets home and Roman legions had already arrived, tortured and raped his family, hanged them and then left. My question, how did they know? Did Commodus, still up in Germanica somewhere pull out his cell phone and make a call?! I mean, Maximus goes as fast as he can but the enemy troops seem to not only know Commodus' orders but that he is the new Emperor.A friend of mine said that there were communication methods that could have been used. Carrier pigeons, signal towers, etc. Fine, but if the film makers want me to buy that, they should show me this.Next, Maximus falls to the ground grieving for his dead family and then boom, next scene, he's a wounded slave. How did this happen? Even more curious is why a slaver bothered with caring for a wounded slave with the Mediterranean so close by to act as a dumping ground.Third, I still can't understand how Maximus manages to become such an acclaimed gladiator. Nothing I saw endured me toward him and while he was a general that doesn't make him an exceptional fighter. I don't know if I'd win a fight against General Schwarzkopf or Collin Powell but I bet Mike Tyson could beat them in a fight.Finally, all the other anachronisms just added up to cause my poor suspension of disbelief to evaporate.","

"Gladiator","icclyf","19 July 2020","Great Story! Great Writing! Great Acting! Great Directing! Great Score! This movie has it all. I especially enjoyed the mood of the film. Even though it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style. The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations. Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the ""general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor."" Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine. It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla. However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles. Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers. Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo, the trainer for the gladiators. The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the ""thrill of the Coliseum"" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate. The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene. But the whole movie is a rush! Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie. Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing. I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages. Next to Braveheart, this movie is the greatest of all-time!","

I remember watching this at the cinema on release and being blown away. One of those films that I knew I just had to own and watched it multiple times. It is a favourite, but I hadn't watched it for about 10 years.I think I enjoyed it more than ever this time..
This is simply a masterpiece.(I do think the extra 15 minutes of the extended cut make it even better)..
Crowe and Phoenix are superbly cast and deliver exquisite performances, particularly Phoenix who exudes wickedness and provides a character which has you longing for his comeuppance..
The cinematography and also the use of CGI captures the time and setting, and gives a splendid visual interpretation of Rome at the height of its power..
The theme 'Now we are free' plays a massive part in this film, and the offering from Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard is powerful and captures the spirituality so well..
The story is superb and you cannot help but long to join with Maximus in his quest for vengeance. It grabs hold of me each time and won't let me go until long after the credits roll..
Superb all round and so many quotable lines..
Yes Maximus, Without doubt, I was entertained.","

If we did this survey we would probably be amazed and if we asked who had seen it more than once we would be even more surprised. Ridley Scott not only managed to exalt the 50,000 Romans in the Colosseum (to quote the film) but practically the entire world. Paradoxically, the story of General Massimo Decimo Meridio has only one limit: it is almost entirely invented, but invented at the highest possible level. So well structured that many still believe that General Massimo really existed and performed similar deeds. Some phrases from the film have become cult, a source of inspiration for slogans especially in sporting and social events and the story of the gladiators has forever acquired an indelible image in the eyes of the world, that of Massimo. There's no denying it, the new century has really started off in a great way with this production, you couldn't ask for anything better because... ""on my signal... unleash hell""!","

"Gladiator","mar9","29 January 2002","...the standard Sword 'n Sandal epic. Russell Crowe propels this film in a tour de force of a performance, ably supported by a solid supporting cast. Even the often appalling Oliver Reed does good work in his last film. Ridley Scott directs this film with a deft touch, heavy where he needs to be, violent and brutal, but not gratuitous, and with a good eye for the spectacular.The plot stretches credibility in the latter half and I for one feel that Maximus' identity was exposed to the evil Commodus just a bit too early on. Commodus - what a villain, played with just a touch of camp by Joaquin Phoenix. Swarthy, oily, murderous, cowardly, lusting disgustingly after his own sister, what other name could one give such a character than a Latinised word for ""toilet"". One of the most repulsive creations ever put on celluloid by an actor. Can't blame him though, there had to be something substantial to match Crowe's massive screen presence. Bloody good.","

I don't think that's completely fair. Sure there are some similarities but ""Gladiator"" is original enough with an own unique style.The movie has a very good unique atmosphere like we are used from Ridley Scott movies. Visually the movie looks wonderful (with the exception of a few fake looking background shots of Rome). Especially the battle scene's (the gladiator fights in particular) are filmed in a wonderful way with some good editing and are something you have never seen before. You can almost feel the tension and fear and smell the sweat of the gladiators when they are entering the arena.The acting is top class! Russell Crowe is a great leading man but was his role Oscar worthy? I don't think so, he deserved an Oscar more for his role in ""A Beautiful Mind"". Joaquin Phoenix gives an impressive performance and the same goes for Richard Harris, Oliver Reed and yes, Spencer Treat Clark that shows his talent.What makes the movie even more complete is the excellent musical score by Hans Zimmer and the great looking costumes and epic settings and feeling.But no the movie is not perfect. The story at times is messy and at times it loses it's speed. It feels like it's just a lame excuse to fill up the scene's between the gladiator fights. Also some characters and moments don't feel needed at all, I don't know I can't really put my finger on it. But it's not a bad thing, the good things about the movie makes you actually forget the bad things.Worth watching if only just for the spectacular and impressive battle scene's.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","

The winner is: Russell Crowe (by a long shot).   I liked Russell Crowe in this film.  His performance is what keeps the movie generated with electricity from start to finish.  Although Douglas was good as Spartacus, I found Crowe's performance much better. Laurence Olivier (Crassus) vs. Joaquin Phoenix (Commodus)The winner is: Laurence Olivier.  No actor could steal a screen performance like Olivier.  Phoenix goes overboard with his character in some scenes.Peter Ustinov (Lentulus Batiatus) vs. Oliver Reed (Proximo)
The winner is: a draw.I liked both characters from each film.  Ustinov won an Oscar for his Supporting role, but Reed was equally impressive, too.Direction: Stanley Kubrick vs. Ridley ScottThe winner is: Kubrick (by a long shot).  Special Effects:  The winner is Spartacus.  One example is the mammoth battle scene towards the end of the film.  Gladiator is littered with computerized special effects.I feel Spartacus still holds my interest as best gladiator film ever made. The only thing that holds Gladiator together is Crowe's performance.Spartacus: 8.5 (out of 10). Gladiator: 8 (out of 10).","

"Gladiator","PudgyPandaMan","9 February 2009","I typically prefer classic films because I, for one, don't think Hollywood makes movies like they used to. Plus, I think most modern films are heavy on the sex and foul language - and as a Christian, I find it offensive.So it is rare when Hollywood puts out not only a great film in terms of the quality of the story and the performances, but which also has very little language and no explicit sexual content (inspite of this being rated R but that is due to the violence).This movie did something that rarely happens with me in modern films in that it completely absorbed me into the time period, the location and the story. I felt somewhat transported for the entire length - which given its long running time, was quite a feat. It never once seemed to lag or get slow - but kept my complete attention. Not only that, but I have seen this film numerous times (probably at least 6 times) and it never fails to capture my complete attention - even though I know what is going to happen next. That is the sign of not only a great movie - but a MASTERPIECE in my opinion.Crowe's performance was amazing, but I'm a little surprised that he won, while Joaquin Phoenix was ROBBED. He was nominated, but lost to Benicio Del Torro for TRAFFIC. Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus was so completely engrossing - the creep factor was exponential. I think his is one of the all time great villainous portrayals - but in ways that at times were so subtle that it made him even more despicable.I only had one mild complaint of the film which is I felt the past history between Lucilla and Maximus was not completely explained and I think would have enriched the understanding of the 2 characters.I own very few DVD's but this is one that we did end up getting since it never fails to deliver a completely absorbing experience - time after time!","

"Gladiator","SECurtisTX","30 March 2004","This movie is the very epitome of what I hate about movies.  The Hollywood-ization/bastardization of what could have been a great movie. The FX and action were great, the characterization was adequate, the plot was dumb, and the ending was abysmal.  Why doesn't anyone in Hollywood have the courage to take a movie where it ought to go instead of where the test audiences say it should go?This is a gladiator movie.  You know what that means?  It was set during the Roman Empire.  During the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus. It was NOT a fantasy.  When you set a movie during a historical time frame, there are certain rules you have to abide by.  One of those is, you do not rewrite history on a grand scale.  The main reason to set a movie within a historical context is to give it plausibility.  You do not then crap on that plausibility by having the characters do things that would have caused all of history to lumber down a different path.In Braveheart, William Wallace did not rally the Scots, defeat the English, march into London, kill the king of England in a duel, and establish a democracy.  Why?  Because that isn't what happened; and it would have turned a great movie into a crappy movie.  In Dances With Wolves, John Dunbar does not rally the Sioux nation in a war to conquer the United States, kill Ulysses S. Grant in a duel, and establish a new form of government in Washington based on Sioux practices.  Why?  Because that isn't what happened; and it would have turned a great movie into a crappy movie.  In Gangs of New York, Leo DiCaprio's character did not face Abe Lincoln in an arena, kill him, and establish a new form of government in Washington where the Irish were the ruling class.  Why?  Because that isn't what happened; and it would have turned a mediocre movie into a crappy movie.
***SPOILER ALERT!!!***
So in Gladiator, an exiled Roman general kills the Emperor in the arena and in so doing allows the reestablishment of the Roman Republic in 182 A.D. You know what?  It didn't happen that way, and it turned a great movie into a crappy movie.  The makers of this movie took all the plausibility of setting and trashed it.  They took a pretty good historical action movie and turned it into a suck-ass fantasy.  And the better the movie is before the movie-makers pull their pants down and squat over it, the more I resent the dump being taken on it.  And that's the case here.","

True it`s the sort of story we`ve seen before in several genres where good defeats evil but what`s wrong with that ? It`s well acted with Joaquin Phoenix playing the role of villain the right side of camp , well supported by a bunch of British thespians - Notice how many of the bad guys are played by Americans and good guys by Brits . Don`t see that too often - and Ridley Scott pulls out all the stops to make GLADIATOR a technical triumph , a shame he didn`t win the Oscar for best director , he`ll be hard pushed to make a film as good as this again. And accolades to John Mathieson and Hans Zimmer for photography and music respectively.GLADIATOR is one of three old fashioned Hollywood epics to have won the Oscar for best picture in recent years . After seeing the overrated BRAVEHEART and the truly awful TITANIC and comparing them with true epics like GONE WITH THE WIND , BEN HUR and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA I thought to myself "" Alas they don`t make them like they used to "".

I know there are sites that claim that historically it is true, but let's be honest...no emperor will ever fight a Gladiator. EVER!!! No matter who the Gladiator really is, just imagine Spartacus fighting the emperor. Umm...no!Second of all --- there is no way Gladiator deserved the Oscar for movie of the year...Sure it deserved to get all the technical decorations and computer animation and whatever else they did to make the Coliseum and all the special effects, but BEST MOVIE?? Is the Academy on crack?
Third of all -- there was no strong acting...NONE!! There were some touching scenes and some beautiful scenes of nature and blood for that matter (if you find that thrilling), but not one actor did a wonderful job acting...They were all predictable. Of course the girl loved the hero and the father didn't love the son, etc., etc. A cliche on top of cliche is all this movie is made of and then it gets an Oscar. Well at least next year the Oscars will be better because they couldn't possibly screw up more this year.
And lastly, when I leave a movie theater, I would like to have something to think about because of a movie I just saw. Some sort of a greater, bigger picture. Here we had a point that being dishonest and weak fires back! That's an original! And it certainly take three hours to deliver that point to the audience. I am not even arguing for good movies to be recognized because given what I think is good may not be the standard for everyone else, but let us not recognize something that is unworthy of it.

Gladiator is a film that aims to enthral as well as delight with its epic tale, breathtaking setting, and larger-than-life characters. It captivates viewers and submerges them in a realm that is different from their own. Every time the hero overcomes the odds and prevails in a skirmish or swings the balance of battle in his favour, a raucous response is anticipated. This is a large-scale piece of filmmaking.Director Ridley Scott established his reputation in the industry by directing the science fiction classics Alien and Blade Runner. Apart from such movies, though, his filmography is filled with average and unenthusiastic works, as his most recent project, G. I. Jane. (Some claim that the overrated Thelma and Louise from 1991 marked Scott's return to form, but I disagree.) The British-born filmmaker's second historical epic, Gladiator, is much more successful than his first, the tedious 1492: Conquest of Paradise, which chronicled Christopher Columbus' voyage to the New World.","

"Gladiator","Erik_Surewaard","4 September 2022","The Colosseum... A place that stands not only for being one of the most beautiful monuments of the Roman Empire, but also a place at which many a great warrior has died. Death in the service of keeping the people of Rome entertained, preventing them from even thinking of an uprising against the ruling caesar. Even today, many peolle travel specifically to Rome to see the remnants of this huge palace of entertainment.That Rome stands central in a movie called ""Gladiator"" may be not that remarkable. What though is remarkable that there was such a long time since the last popular movie in the ""swords and sandals""-genre... Actually, it was 1958 - with a movie named ""Ben Hur"" - that we saw such a highly rated movie in its genre.And the wait was more than wortwile! Because Gladiator tells its story - in the most intricate of detail - in an extremely beautiful way! The buildings, vehicles, clothing, weapons and other props are all so beautiful that they just suck you up in the world of ancient Rome. The scenery is just so breathtaking that it will leave you with the impression that you just sat yourself on the bleachers of the Colloseum!The storyline is losely based on the real rulers of the second century Roman empire. Marcus Aurelius and his evil son Conmodus form the basis of the story. It is thereby one of the Roman generals named Maximus that stands central in this movie. Played by Russell Crowe, Maximus is forced to become a Gladiator. And the life of that Gladiator stands central in this movie.The supreme acting of not only Crowe but also many of the other actors makes this movie belong to a list of movies that you can watch multiple times during your life. And you are wrong if you think that its 2h35m duration may cause you to get bored. My own experience was that the movie was over before I even noticed it! And mind you, this was already the second time that I watched this movie since it was released.Watching this movie was such a great experience that I gave it a well-deserved 10 stars. I will most certainly watch this movie again in the future.","

I couldn't care less, if Russell Crowe won in the end.  I didn't feel sorry for his character at any point in the movie.  In fact, by the second hour, I found myself wishing for his immediate death so they'd end the movie.  I blame most of the movie's problems on director Ridley Scott.  He's a hideous director, and I don't know why everyone keeps confusing him with a good director.  During half of the fight scenes and during the battle scene at the beginning, it took the entire scene just to figure out what was happening.  You could never tell what was going on. Thus, this movie isn't even good for a few cheap thrills.  It isn't good: C-","

"Gladiator","rickneworleans","1 December 2000","The biggest single indictment of this disatrous excuse for an epic is that the one truly great actor in the movie, Derek Jacobi, is (like Richard Harris and Oliver Reed) brought in to bring a whiff of authentic class (to hide the other whiffs), and, like the others, is quickly snuffed.  Jacobi, of course, was the absolutely brilliant star of the probably the greatest Roman epic ever, I, CLAUDIUS.  That scintillating 13-hour classic doesn't have a single boring or predictable moment (unlike this mess) and is all characterization and plotting, not spectacle, the exact opposite of this movie, which uses character stereotypes and a ludicrous storyline that wouldn't pass the cartoon test.  Half the acting is Russell Crowe swearing revenge and grimacing as he flexes his pectorals.  Even the spectacle here is MUDDY and BLOODY.  If you want to be like the Romans and enjoy the sight of people being disemboweled and torn limb from limb, then by all means check this out.  But, please, watch one of the classics instead and you'll quickly dump this pretender.","

"Gladiator","searchanddestroy-1","15 August 2023","As Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott rose during the seventies with two masterpieces: DUELLISTS and ALIEN. Spielberg, JAWS, DUEL, ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.... Both were then rather young to bring such jewels. Scott is ten years older than his ""opponent"" but both have in common to continue, after all those decades, to provide regularely other masterpieces, and both have made around 30-35 movies, and for both of them - again- NAPOLEON film for Scott and mini series for Spielberg are also in their calendar. So GLADIATOR is a milestone for the sword and sandal - peplum - genre. Because the last ones were the Italian - and some American - productions from the early sixties, and as far as I know, there were not since. It was a kind of films totally forgotten from the bulk of audiences; but not the die hard movie goers, of course. This movie is unique, awesome, outstanding and opened the way, a boulevard, to many others: TROY,300 being the most widely known. The new, young audiences then discovered what their elders loved when they - youngest - were not even born. Ridley Scott resurrected the sword and sandal film genre with this one. And many sequences - particularely the hand of Russel Crowe touching the wheat field, was taken in at least one hundred other films and even commercials. Scott came from commercials business, during the seventies. Maybe this explains that.","

"Gladiator","neotek-2","12 June 2000","This movie is one of the worst I've ever been forced to watch. I mean, I came out of the cinema and wondered why the sun wasn't already up. I thought it must have been at least 8 hours long. It's just so BORING! When you think about it, what happens in this movie? Tough guy kills some dudes. Tough guy talks about honour with old guy. Mean guy kills old guy. Tough guy kills some other dudes. Mean guy talks about honor with girl. Tough guy weeps for his family. Tough guy talks about honor with black guy, then kills some dudes. (Repeat last three lines until bored, and then some more). If they would have just stuck to the killing part, then it would have been a mediocre action film. But no, they had to add ""depth"" (=lots of ""philosophical"" (=clicheed) truisms, with about 30 seconds of pauses/reaction shots between sentences). Actually, the screenwriter packed the script with so many clichees he actually only missed one: Flavius (the nephew of the mean guy) is not Maximus's son. Bummer. I thought I knew everything that would happen after the first quarter of an hour.O.K. The good points: The first three fights or so ARE compelling (the other 20 or so cease to be). Ancient Rome never looked so real (Shame about the rest of the movie). The actors can act (their roles are just so clicheed the creators could have done with Muppets).One final question : Does Crowe really go from Germania to Spain in one day (Some horse that must be...), and from Spain to North Africa in another two? In a CART? I Refuse to have seen that. I must have fallen asleep for a few hours. It's possible with this movie. Zero stars.","

"Gladiator","mike n","11 May 2000","I went to see Gladiator with low expectations, going only because I have a 1-2 movie a week habit, and there have been few good movies opening in American theaters in recent weeks.  What follows, therefore, is an opinion about one hollywood summer blockbuster movie from someone who admittedly doesn't like such movies in the first place.First of all, Gladiator has the generic faults of most such movies: 1) sophisticated and expensive production design, editing and special effects contrasted with a simple-minded story, stilted dialogue and characters with incomprehensible or unbelievable motivation; and 2) excessive length.  (To be fair, it does not have the very common third flaw, excessive noise.) There are many decent low-budget movies that get by with thin plots and bad dialogue, when directed quickly with some flair; but adding money, big-name (and talented) actors and length makes things worse, not better.I find the violence in Gladiator's battle and fighting sequences very distasteful.  I had the same feeling about Braveheart, although that movie at least balanced its violence with scenes of levity.  I do not object to cartoon violence in movies, and I have never been bothered by anything I saw in John Woo's or other Hong Kong movies.  Graphic scenes of realistic violence do upset me, even more so when (as in this movie or in Braveheart) it is ""righteous"" violence meted out by the hero.Finally, I was disgusted by the movie's misinterpretations of history.  The Roman Senate was an instrument of aristocracy, not democracy.  Commodus was killed by disgruntled servants, and no one thought of replacing him with anything but another emperor.  Having him decide to fight a skilled gladiator is the supreme example of lame screenwriting in this movie.","

"Gladiator","Calibanhagseed","26 March 2008","I can't even describe how much I loath this film, but being a hater I'll try.Lets begin with the historical representation first. Personally I don't give a hoot if the facts are all wrong, if the uniforms and clothing and use of weaponry are historically incorrect. (People who's concerns about this dragon of a film tend that way, I gave those geeks wedgies in High-school) But the representation of the Roman empire as a benign benefactor spreading civilization through out the world is ludicrous, such sentiments belong to the aforementioned wedgie sufferers and elitist euro-republicans.Then there's the script, which is a pathetic attempt at lyrical writing, even Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson could do a better job. Never the less, it was amusing in a so-bad-it's-funny sorta way.And Russel Crowe, let's not forget the torment of watching Russel Crowe act. It's like his brawling: fake and an attempt to hide his 80's new wave rock alter ego; Russ Le Rock. But his constipated stoicism and grunting and mumbling will appear as the classic lone warrior acting to the low-brows who love this film.Oh, Yes and then there's the music. When I heard Rock like rhythms played over roman soldiers marching, I laughed out loud, usually anachronistic film-scoring is the forté of Asian cinema, that can pull this stunt. The music only got worse, from new-age warbling of Lisa Gerrad to pompous choir passages, that even Howard Shore would be ashamed to use.This movie was a non wavering onslaught of boredom and cinematic torture, and I for one was happy when the credits rolled.","

The movie didn't blow me away. Throughout the movie, I was reminded of films that did a better job. ""Gladiator"" felt very drab and, in some stretches, dull.I've been impressed with Russell Crowe's work in a number of movies including ""Romper Stomper"", ""L.A. Confidential"" and especially, ""The Insider"". I was not impressed with his work in this movie. I thought that he captured the physical aspects but not the emotional. I was surprised how much I didn't care about his character.I thought Joaquin Phoenix did a better job as Commodus. His callous, cold-blooded actions were right on target. I did find it interesting that Derek Jacobi, who played Gracchus, played a similar character in the title role of ""I, Claudius"" several decades ago.Considering all the battles that occurred in the film, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Oliver Reed gave his most understated performance in the final movie of his career.As always, with any Ridley Scott film, the visuals will always be impressive. But unless the script he directs from is really good (e.g., ""Thelma and Louise""), the end product will always be a good-looking but underwhelming movie.","

"Gladiator","eldakim","7 June 2006","This is by far one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It actually inspired me to be something greater. I felt the need to achieve and become what truly defines a man. Maximus is seriously one of my favorite characters in movie history because he's fascinating and interesting to know about. He is also, once again, what stands as a true definition of a man. A man has to be responsible and patient, and this man just does that. If I have to pick a single most influential person besides Jesus, I'd still go with Maximus. What he did in the movie was truly outstanding and I wish that he was an actual person in history. The death of his family gave him a small moment of despair, but he took it all in, including the loss of his rank and his status now as a ""slave."" As Maximus gradually progresses as a gladiator in the movie, he just becomes more and more bad ass, being the true hero of the entire movie. He never flinches in pain, but stands up, all the way to the end. The faithfulness he builds in his two friends is awe-inspiring, and their willing to take consequences for his survival is what represents strong friendship. Maximus is by heart THE man. Gladiator is one of the most inspirational movies I saw, and there are no others like it.The movie itself was purely genius. Although it's a pretty simple story about revenge, it has interesting side stories and build ups of characters. The performance as Maximus by Crowe was electrifying. He pounds in every good quotes in the movie in the most awesome ways. Phoenix as Commodus was also notable. I truly hated this character because I saw him as a coward and the true villain of movies. He is just so evil and so cold, even his expressions and appearances define that. Phoenix was just so great as this character, and no others would have been able to land such a villainous role. Other notable characters were Djimon Honsou as the gladiator friend as well as the many others that Crowe's Maximus encountered. Connie Nielsen was also great as Lucilla, who was interesting in that she didn't have a like mind as Commodus. I felt the passion she had for Maximus and the statement she makes about Maximus in the end. I think Oliver Reed as Proximo was a great character that I can easily compare as the teacher. He brought up Maximus's true strength and trained him to become a defined warrior. At first impression, he seemed like a cold blooded man, but the last scene of him with Maximus proved of how caring he is for Maximus and for his sake. Overall, the actors and actresses did an outstanding job playing their parts.The score and the effects were just beautiful. The battle songs were just so inspirational and I found myself listening to it for a boost of strength. The special effects and movie quality was so rich and brilliant, with some of the best actions available.Overall, I think Ridley Scott did a great job in making this film. This movie will simply be placed in my list of best movies in all time.","

"Gladiator","markles","11 May 2000","Let me preface this by saying I'm a fan of most of Ridley Scott's work. Bladerunner is a terrific flick and Alien ain't too shabby, either.  Then I saw the trailers for Gladiator and some early reviews(almost exclusively raves) and got excited for a good, well-made film.  What I got was the most boring movie I've seen in a theater in quite some time.  Initially, I gave the film the benefit of the doubt...a lot of people liked this so it must get interesting sooner or later.  About 45 minutes into the film, however, I realized it wasn't going to get any better.  I first looked at my watch at that point and proceeded to do so at least every ten minutes thereafter.  I hoped the reel would catch fire and save me from watching the last hour but, alas, I had to watch until the end.  I probably would've left but I attended the film with my father and we hadn't been to a movie together since T2...what're ya gonna do?.Gladiator was lifeless and unoriginal.  The plot was shabby and often laughable, and I honestly believe the folks at MST3K could've had a pretty good time with it.  Much of the dialogue was cheesy, the camera work was largely uninspired and every time a computer generated 'roman' backdrop was on screen the characters amidst them were fuzzy and shadowy.  At other times Scott included footage to purposely sicken the audience, i.e. the ""snot"" scene.  Did anyone else find that as nasty as I?Another problem with this film as that, despite its epic running time, the plot progression is hasty and incomplete.  Maximus goes from general to slave in about 3 scenes(why is he a slave again?) and kills around 7 people as a gladiator before becoming the most popular man in Rome.  There's plenty of room for good development within two and a half hours.  Instead, Scott pushes Gladiator's sub-par progression only within the brief action scenes(the only interesting scenes in the entire movie...honestly) and offsets them with minutes upon minutes(hours?) of crap that doesn't go anywhere.  The raves this movie has received confuse me.    Gladiator is the most overrated movie in years.If you're looking for a good movie along the same lines, watch Conan the Barbarian.  Gladiator uses roughly the same story line, but Conan is about 3000 times more entertaining.  And don't get popcorn before you enter the theater.  Believe me, you'll welcome any excuse to get up and stretch your legs before the movie actually concludes.","

In all honesty, I loved the performances and story so much in this film that the action might have been my least favorite part of it. Between Russel Crowe's simple but powerful performance to Joaquin Phoenix's literally unbeaten performance as an unstable psychopath filled with rage, there was always something interesting and nail biting going on. Some people may think this film is overhyped, and in certain respects I can understand that, but personally I believe this is a must see for anyone who likes movies.","

"Gladiator","Thanos_Alfie","14 March 2021","""Gladiator"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we watch a man seeks revenge from the Roman emperor who set the murder of his family and tried to kill him too. He has to find a way to approach the emperor and be ready to take his revenge.I liked this movie very much because it had an amazingly interesting plot that kept me in tense through its whole duration and the direction which was made by Ridley Scott was simply outstanding. The interpretation of Russell Crowe who played as Maximus was iconic and I believe that he did an excellent job. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Joaquin Phoenix's who played as Commodus, Richard Harris' who played as Marcus Aurelius and Djimon Hounsou's who played as Juba. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Gladiator"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that you will be amazed by it.","

"Gladiator","Bogmeister","5 September 2005","Ridley Scott brings his stylistic sense to the historical epic in this recreation of the Roman Empire at its zenith. This time frame is actually ahead of the usual one with Julius Caesar that we're mostly used to seeing and actually takes place, I believe, during the same time as the elder epic ""The Fall of the Roman Empire""(64). By the title and the hearsay, you'd expect the story to revolve around gladiatorial combat in the arena, but though some of the significant scenes do take place there, the scope encompasses all of Rome and its surrounding provinces. The beginning is a lengthy sequence depicting a final battle in the war against Germania, a brutal & staggering depiction of two armies in combat. It's here that director Scott presents the flavor of what the viewer will become accustomed to as the picture progresses: important people, important events, important decisions - set to an epic scale, of course.But it's the people portion of the formula that dominates what could have been just another epic. Maximus (Crowe), a Roman general at the start of the pic, makes it clear very early where his priorities lie: with his wife & son, whom he hasn't seen in over two years. Yet, he's also intensely loyal to the empire and the emperor (Harris). We realize he's caught between the two responsibilities at this early stage of the film and it's not a simple dilemma; priorities must be weighed, possible impacts both personal & political. Although a decision is taken out of his hands, we see that it's not a simple solution of 'well, i'll go home' as he desired which would have dictated his actions. There's real intelligence to the script by this point. Crowe won the Oscar for his part and though he probably was more deserving for a couple of other films, it's easy to see how he carried the picture here.The supporting cast is first rate. Phoenix as Commodus, the new emperor who takes the decision out of Maximus' hands, does not come across as a standard villain, despite his actions (patricide, lusting for his sister, sadistic murder). You see him make revolting faces during the gladiatorial games, reveling in the blood spilled, and of course you think, what a grotesque villain. Yet, in other scenes he is quite pitiful - it's astonishing we can feel any sympathy for this wretch, but Phoenix plays the 'daddy should have loved me' angle to the hilt - and it works. The no.1 position in the empire dictates that the holder cannot trust anyone, it's so true; no one seems more alone than Phoenix throughout the film. Oliver Reed hams it up a bit as an arena entertainer, but it is Reed, a fitting final role. There's a lot a class spread out among the remainder of the cast - Harris, Jacobi, Hemmings all lend some gravitas, and Connie Nielsen is very good in a truly regal role.Since much of this film involves gladiatorial combat, I must at least mention the fighting scenes in the various arenas. They are very well done. But they're probably not the main reason to see the picture.","

"Gladiator","Top_Dawg_Critic","11 July 2017","I'm not the biggest fan of Russell Crowe - his roles are stale and don't really offer anything great to say he has something special to offer in them, but this one was somewhat of an exception. Ridley Scott's amazing direction is what propelled this movie and Russell Crowe's performance. Joaquin Phoenix's role was perfectly cast and overall this movie kept me on the edge of my seat. The visuals were great as was the writing. Very entertaining and a must see. It's a 9/10 from me.","

"Gladiator","chaos-rampant","10 April 2014","Here the interesting thing worth commenting is vision. It's otherwise a typical film of its sort if several years more later it appears to have not been particularly prescient of the wonderful advances we've had since in the way of telling a story.Its' a reworking of Fall of the Roman Empire, an amazingly clunky epic from the 60s around the same story that signaled the end of its type; in its narrative trajectory this is as stale now. The hero and villain, the conflict, the rising above circumstances and poetic redemption. The stage is of course far more dynamic, it's overall closer to the eye but frames the same one dimension.Kingdom of Heaven was more evocative for me; there we started by following an ordinary man swept to a far and mysterious historic horizon, the journey was to a place where destiny threatened to reveal itself, though the film otherwise partook of many of the same faults as this, the blacksmith became the hero, the tentative horizon became the painting of brave exploits.The nested story here is about the power of vision. It's the vision Commodus creates to manipulate a mob addicted to empty spectacle, the gladiator-movie that we came to see, enough to forego our mundane worries about what's wrong with the state of things. We see the emperor place miniatures of gladiators in a replica of the arena and this is followed by a majestic aerial shot of tiny particles of people flushing towards the Colosseum for the movie.Then it's the hero's vision of what he can achieve by agreeing to play his part in that spectacle, redemption. He does this by not entertaining, by showing mercy and challenging our demand for bloodshed, though only after this has been sated by protracted killing.But does any of this does what it says? The answer for me is no. If it did along the lines it sets up, we'd leave this disgusted by the hollow spectacle and not secretly titillated, informed by the possibility of mercy for redemption and not glorying in the revenge.No the only powerful thing here for me is the further nested vision of Maximus that gives him strength to keep going; the vision of loved ones.Scott wisely discerned that this had to be bound to a tangible place, the lovely home in the Roman countryside, that it would be our visual tether as we strayed to the accidental world of organized cruelties. It's all anchored on this spot. The shot of his hand caressing the rippling wheat is on his way to meet them, imagined, at first as a much anticipated return from years of war, later as a reunion in the next world. Scott could have done so much more to visually caress the place in mind but the fact that he places it at the center tells me he was wise to the power of vision and mind. Isn't the shot of the dirt road leading up to the house lined with cypress trees rippling in the wind one of the most memorable images here? Maximus description of the house to the emperor conjures the imagery the camera omits, earthy smells and textures.Several magnitudes more powerful than any vindication in the arena, the power of this vision would be that of not losing sight of what makes us human, not letting the darkness of dungeons and arenas of life pull this anchor.","

Acting apart from Russell Crowe is very good and special mention for Joaquin Phoenix in the character of Commodus.

"Gladiator","Reviews_of_the_Dead","22 August 2022","This is a movie that I originally saw in the theater with my mother and sister when it came out. I believe this would have put Russell Crowe on my radar along with Joaquin Phoenix. That first time seeing this, I loved it. It is one that I've seen since then, but it had been a while. Jaime and I watched this with her parents as well while we were visiting them. This is on our Internet Movie Database poster as well.We follow Maximus (Crowe) as they're fighting the barbarian tribes of Germania. The emperor is Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). He is fond of Maximus and much of this is the time that has been spent on the battlefield. Maximus is a great general. They score a victory and this brings Marcus' children to celebrate, Lucilla (Connie Nielson) and Commodus (Phoenix). Marcus scolds his son and this enrages him, causing him to kill the emperor. Without the knowledge of what happened, Commodus has Maximus branded a traitor and they try to kill him.There are events that happen that land Maximus a slave and owned by Proximo (Oliver Reed). He bought him to compete as a gladiator. Proximo can see the promise that Maximus has. It also leads him back to Rome, known as the Spaniard. Commodus flirts with becoming a dictator and those in the senate do not want that. Corruption is starting in Rome and Maximus could be a tool to fix it.Now while writing this, I did realize something. I didn't know that Marcus and Commodus are real people. I didn't look deeper to see if the events that happened here or real or not, because this feels like it is borrowing from Spartacus. If there is truth here or not, I love this story. We have a revenge story at its core. I'm fascinated by world history where this is set. The gladiator battles are something else that are fascinating to me. There is an interesting commentary here on government corruption that is social relevant as well. You could say that the United States is flirting with this now on both sides. As someone who loves commentary, you have me on board.If you don't care about subtext, we still have good performances. It is funny seeing a man from New Zealand play a Spaniard, but Crowe is good. He has charisma for this role, especially to entertain the audiences. Phoenix is a great villain. Nielsen is good along with Spencer Treat Clark as her son. I also liked seeing Djimon Hounsou as another slave and even Tommy Flanagan. We also get a great cast of older actors here with smaller roles like Reed, Harris, Derek Jacobi, David Schofield, John Shrapnel, Tomas Arana and David Hemmings. Along with the casting, I love the battle scenes. This movie goes brutal with the effects, which I appreciate. There is a gritty and dirty feel to the fighting that feels real. This is a film that holds up after multiple watches in my opinion and I can see why it is sits in the Top 100 on IMDb. Plus, Ridley Scott could direct the heck out of a movie.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.","

Full marks for being one of the best films ever made.It is not historically accurate with the plot but that's not the point (it seems a mash of different events and people who existed at one time or another in during the Roman Empire. From what I know of ancient Rome the story is within the realms of possibility.) The characters are all great. Pheonix is annoying but intentionally so - he acts his character perfectly. The script is kind of poetic at times - it seems it underwent at least three full scale revisions by different masters of script writing.There are a number of different accents in the film but then Rome was probably a pretty multicultural place and we're hardly going to wish they had made it in Latin.","

"Gladiator","fredrikgunerius","9 August 2023","A sword-and-sandal film of very much classical proportions about power, deceit and tyrannical rule, and how one hero of almost superhuman abilities and goodness rises up against it all and triumphs on behalf of the people. Ridley Scott directs with a command and grandeur befitting a film of this scale, and Russell Crowe in the title role carries the film with a confidence bordering on arrogance reminiscent of Richard Burton in Cleopatra (and with the brilliant Joaquin Phoenix mirroring Roddy McDowall in the same movie). Crowe is oozing of old-fashioned masculinity and star-power, something which in no small part contributes to the film's timeless effect. The action sequences have all the underdoggish, stick-it-to-the-man feel you could ever want.","

"Gladiator","rmax304823","1 June 2007","The emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) is murdered by his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Aurelius's designated successor, General Maximus (Russel Crowe) is betrayed, becomes a slave, a gladiator, finally a the most popular gladiator in Rome, and kills Commodus before he himself drops dead of an unfair wound. Rome is turned over to Senator Grachus and is saved. Commodus's sister (Connie Nielson) has a son who will become the next emperor. Actually, that happy return to a Republic is tacked on, isn't it? Dictatorships continued till the end.I kept trying to figure out just what elements distinguished ""Gladiator"" from the earlier sun and sandal epics of the 1950s, like ""Herculus,"" usually starring some beefed-up parody of a male figure like Steve Reeves, or ""Ben Hur"" for that matter.Obviously ""Gladiator"" is more expensive and the special effects more especially effective. And, thank God, unlike Steve Reeves' epics the movie isn't dubbed, so nobody sounds like Orson Welles gargling.""Gladiator"" is darker all around than almost all earlier movies of the period. Cinecitta was always so sunny and its weather so balmy. There's a moment near the beginning of ""Ben Hur"" when Judah and Massala meet and Massala removes his decorative metal cuirass and reveals the soft scarlet cloth beneath it. It's a neat splash of color. There's nothing like that in ""Gladiator."" The Romans all wear dark clothing, usually black. And their armor is spiky-looking and abrasive, as if influenced by some video game or by Dungeons and Dragons. I guess the Senate wears white but even their robes are drained of brightness, so that they resemble the sheets that my laundry dryer produces. And sometimes it's cold too. Snow falls and the Romans wear fur robes. Pretty ugly stuff.The dialog isn't dubbed but the Foley artists have been hard at work generating the expectable clichés. No sword can be drawn without the slick sound of sharp metal against metal. And God forbid that a sword be thrown through the air without going whoo-whoo-whoo. If one of these behemoths swings his weapon it's invariably accompanied by a swoosh or a wheeesh. I don't know why. It doesn't make the motion more compelling in any way. It's a distraction because somewhere in the viewer's mind there must be the realization that if you swing a piece of metal through the air, it simply does not swoosh. The sounds of battle aren't the only clichés. The ""thumbs down/ thumbs up"" business for death and life was, I think, borrowed from an improvisation in a Cecil B. DeMille movie, not from the historical record.Award for best performance: Richard Harris (his last movie) as Marcus Aurelius, the emperor who is at least as well known for his philosophy -- he was a stoic -- as for his martial exploits. Imagine -- a head of state who can have an original thought? ""Death smiles at all of us and all we can do is smile back."" Award for best-looking and most succulent actress: Connie Nielson. She couldn't be better. I don't know about her performance but she looks absolutely right for the part of the bitter widow, abused by her own brother, hopelessly in love with a man she'll never have. She's beautiful, sensuous, elegant, and as cold as polished steel.Best imitation of Steve Reeves: Russel Crowe, he of the enormous trapezii. I wouldn't want to get in the arena with that guy. His performance? Well -- he tries to laugh at one point.Best bad guy: Joaquin Phoenix isn't bad as the evil, cowardly, deceitful Commodus. It wouldn't surprise me to find that he had an amphora stuffed with ladies' lingerie. I'll give him a pass on insisting on incest, inasmuch as Connie Nielson is the victimized party. But, man, what a creep; no longer the teen age beauty, slightly more plump, and with a thicker voice.Is it worth seeing? Well, of course! Could anything on which so much expense had been lavished NOT be worth seeing? And it's thought provoking too. The thought it provokes is: what is it in human nature that prompts us to watch innocent others suffer and die violently? No? You don't have to look long on the internet to find video clips with titles like ""Iraqi gets blown up,"" or ""Marine has arm shot off!"" We can smugly dismiss ""the mob"" of Romans for their barbaric tastes but we can't pass a highway accident without looking for some mangled limbs. Hell, we revel in it.","

Yet those who cry ""foul"" are strikingly naive in their calls for some sort of recount. It is a prime example of Oscar voters going for a big winner when the ""second-place"" entries managed to cancel out one another's separate claims to be better overall films.  This BEST PICTURE shows signs of being less than the sum of most of its commendable parts, due in greatest part to its haywire plot.  Like the much feared power surges for people's home and work computers, it has plenty of emotional highs and striking brief scenes or cuts but they short-circuit the narrative that you want to puzzle through after the final credits.  I believe the screenplay could have made some sort of ""revisionist"" sense about an introspective Emperor but he is throttled and overthrown in some sort of flip-flop of fortunes that's left unexplained.  Don't blame Joaquin Phoenix for overacting when he seemingly improvises with the lurching dialogue.  For anybody trying to make sense of slavery and gladiators, see a much better film from 1960, Spartacus. Back then actor Kirk Douglas and buddies were telling the director what the finished product should be.  Nowadays, the director uses all the arrows in his quiver to nail us to the trees and we wonder what's hit us as the spectacle overpowers the story.",NA

"Gladiator","dworldeater","9 March 2020","Gladiator is a more modern take on the sword and sandal Roman period epics like Ben Hur and Spartacus. With a big budget and Ridley Scott at the helm, Gladiator is high powered entertainment. Epic in scope with a huge cast and great f/x, this is a marvel to look at and was put together well. A great mix of drama and action with political schemes and battle scenes. The acting was very good all around with character actors like Oliver Reed and Richard Harris. Joaquin Phoenix was a good antagonist and Russel Crowe gave a commanding presence as the lead delivering a powerful performance that won him a richly deserved Oscar for best actor. I remember seeing this at the theater and it completely blew away Mel Gibson's weak attempt to relive the glory of Braveheart with the failed(and very lame) epic The Patriot. Gladiator comes really close to being as good as Braveheart and at times is also very bloody. Gladiator is also bloody good and is well put together all around.

A great cast, story, visual effects and soundtrack are the right ingredients for this iconic film. The story is simply mesmerizing and beautifully told of a respected General who became a slave, who became a Gladiator, and, who then won the praise of many and defied the evil emperor. Just as the spectators in the Coliseum cheer for Maximus so does the viewer as you support his vengeance and justice. Justice against an evil Emperor who killed his family and wants to prevent a Rome governed by the people. The dream that was once Rome as envisioned by his great late father is pushed aside for his selfish wishes. The fights he organizes in the Coliseum are to distract the people as he knows too well that Rome is not the Emperor or the Senate but the mob. Little does he know that soon Maximus will return as a Gladiator to defy him and win the praise of the mob.The final moments are simply masterful. The scene showing Gladiator about to be reunited with his wife and son in the next life and him reaching out to this before he falls is probably one of the best scenes in film history. The soundtrack is simply epic and transports you easily to a time when Gladiators battled in ancient Rome. Hans Zimmer has outdone himself with his work and it works perfectly with some great scenes.Russell Crowe's Gladiator won the hearts of many in the film as I am sure this film won the hearts of many of its viewers.",NA

"Gladiator","rickneworleans","21 November 2000","This movie is a simpleton's epic.  The storyline doesn't pass the laugh test.  Here's the outline (I would warn of SPOILERS, but this thing is already ROTTEN):1) After a great victory in GERMANY, a Heroic Roman general (Russell Crowe) and 100-year-old Roman Emperor with BOTH FEET in the grave (a pathetic-looking Richard Harris) plot to bring back the REPUBLIC to Rome.2) The Emperor's EVIL -- that's E-V-I-L -- and effeminate son (a WAY-OVER-THE-TOP Joaquin Phoenix) gets p***ed when daddy doesn't want to give him supreme power,finishes pushing pops into the grave, attempts the kill the good general, but just wipes out his family a thousand miles in SPAIN instead.3) Just after he discovers his wife and kid are TOAST, the grief-stricken good general is conveniently abducted by slavers to AFRICA, where he becomes THE GREATEST GLADIATOR EVER!, killing off dozens of opponents with each rippled bicep and impressing his teacher, played by Oliver Reed (who played with similar scene-chewing bravado in his prime).4) The good general goes back to ROME, where he wipes out legions in the Colisseum simply by ripping off his shirt to show his MIGHTY PECTORALS! Heads and arms and legs and lots of bloody parts fly all over in the MOST RIDICULOUS GLADITORIAL FIGHTS EVER!

It says a lot when the best performance turned in was by the Oliver Reed, who died during the shooting and had a few of his scenes filled with Oliver's face superimposed by computer over an anonymous actor.The movie also looks terrible with a computer-generated Colisseum which looks totally plastic and a darkness in most of the scenes that is near impenetrable, except, of course, in the ludicrous gladitorial scenes in which every eviscerating moment is in bright sunshine.This movie is Spartacus and Ben Hur for the plot-challenged, character-challenged, nano-second-attention-spanned modern audiences.

But after seeing it a few more times afterward, I began to realize how amazing this film really is. From the very first shot in the wheat to the last shot, Gladiator has a visual power which hasn't been experienced for quite some time.

"Gladiator","cricketbat","16 May 2023","I may have been too harsh on Gladiator. I think because it arrived shortly after Braveheart, and it won Best Picture, I was more critical of it. This is a good movie. However, I still don't think it's as amazing as many people think it is. They struggled writing the script, which I think shows on the screen. The acting is also uneven, with some great moments and some weaker ones. However, the score is absolutely fantastic, and the visual effects are top-notch. I enjoyed watching it more this time around, but I still think that Cast Away should have won Best Picture of 2000 instead of Gladiator.",NA

When I watched the movie I thought look there are several problems with it compared to what actually happened because the entire story is fictional, however, it is entertaining. I also liked how it ended with Russel Crowe dieing and being reunited with his family. It was a nice moment to see him finally happy.The problem was the hype. Throughout my life from the age 10-14 I always heard how this was the best movie in existence. Everyone said that is was much better than any other movie. Then I saw it when I was 14.

"Gladiator","sydmwswy","7 September 2022","Toxic movies that I hate forever I really believe that films like this harm not only the cinema but also our world.The script is zero. The mise-en-scènes are the level of a beginner director. The camera movement is similar to the movement of the camera in many promotional teasers (especially the chariot part).Filming fights is no different from the films that are taken from wrestling, boxing and karate competitions, maybe they are even better. The opening of the movie is inefficient. Ridley Scott tries to combine music with cinematography, but fails. There is nothing good in this movie, everything is made up of ordinary and incomplete sub-narratives that are achieved with a lot of funny trickery. The ups and downs of, for example, the hero of the film have an uncertainty or even false excitement .The family has no definition in the film and is captured by the director's absurd slogans.

"Gladiator","framptonhollis","27 September 2015","""Gladiator"" is a good movie. I, personally, didn't think it was GREAT or PERFECT at all, but I still liked and appreciated the film for what it was. An epic action film! There are some great, awe- inspiring moments and battle scenes that really impressed me. You can tell that, on a technical level, a lot of talent was involved with this project, and Hans Zimmer's score only enhances the epic feeling! Plus, the ending is genuinely powerful, and I cared for the characters.However, when there isn't some grand spectacle of a battle sequence happening, a lot of the film felt a bit bland. Not EVERYTHING that wasn't an action sequence, just a lot of it. It also is a bit predictable and clichéd at times.Overall, ""Gladiator"" isn't a masterpiece script-wise, but more of a masterpiece on a technical level.",NA

That is what makes Gladiator the film that it is. That is why it won Best Picture. It isn't just a meaningless 3 hour bloodbath, it is a breathtaking, epic film that has Russell Crowe avenging the Roman Empire for slaying his family.Russell Crowe is on top form, in an engaging, Oscar grabbing performance that echoed across the film industry.Ridley Scott's epic is a classic story of 'good versus evil', about justice and vengeance packaged in the form of magnificent entertainment.9/10",NA
"Gladiator","dannylee-78082","28 December 2022","It's been more than 20 years since the release of ""Gladiator"" and I finally picked it up.Most of the movie was great. I thought the movie showcased beautiful locations and overall set design. Great production value and excellent scores. I found that the initial battle scene did not age quite well, and perhaps that's because I was so spoiled by GoT's battle scenes. But given the 15+ year gap, I think Ridley Scott's effort was still commendable. The story follows that of Maximus (Russell Crowe), a typical Roman hero, but I didn't feel the catharsis that I was supposed to when the hero finally completes his revenge and his purpose. I'm not entirely sure why but perhaps it's because I am naturally more drawn to broken characters, like Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who by the way, was wonderful. It did leave me curious why Commodus would take the gamble of fighting the most celebrated general in the entire Roman empire. He prepares extensively to ensure of his victory but he is still defeated. Perhaps in his mind, it was the only way to earn back his respect of the people in front of the public but I think it could have easily had a countereffect of the people despising him for killing their beloved general. Was he supposed to be considered egotistical? The man was insecure but never struck me as egotistical. Maybe insecurity and egotism are two sides of the same coin.I enjoyed that the gladiator battles were used as a device to expand the main conflict, which was regarding Rome's future, either as a dictatorship or a republic. After the battle with Tigris, Maximus lets him live despite the crowd's objections but he still pushes for the senate and the republic, representing an action for the people. Commodus, on the other hand, is facilitating these battles, giving what the people want. But he pushes for a dictatorship and the power away from people. Despite placating to people, Commodus never earns the respect of his people, but Maximus gets it effortlessly. This dichotomy added depth to the story and I enjoyed that aspect. It's like the men who try too hard don't get the women, but men that stays cool get them. A bit tacky, but that analogy feels appropriate. It's the strength and honor that earn the respect.It's always a struggle to write a review when your opinion is vastly different from the general public. Maybe it was the ending. Maybe the fact that nobody even tried to save Maximus was baffling to me. Maybe I am allergic to movies that have defined black and white characters. But do I have the strength and honor to maintain my opinion? We shall see.",NA
"Gladiator","hessianmercenary","31 August 2000","After reading many praising comments on Gladiator, I see that I am one of the few who announce how poor this movie was actually. I am not going to write a long comment to explain the shortcomings of this movie because they are so obvious. First of all, the movie was full of clichés and exaggerations. The plot really lacked originality. This was actually the ROMAN VERSION of BRAVE HEART or the latest version of BEN HUR rather than gladiator. I cannot understand why such a stale plot was used...Secondly,, the visual effects were fairly poor, apart from being realistic. For instance the tiger was like a character of one of Disney's animations. It was obviously non-realistic.. And it was also too obvious that the upper part of the coliseum was computer-generated..In the next place, the movie was unreasonably long; long enough to bore the audience. So, all Gladiator fans; please stop giving this poor movie more than it deserves. Since the production cost of this movie was high, some thought this was a great movie, who are fascinated by the fake beauty of gladiator!!! This is the unfortunate fact about gladiator.",NA
"Gladiator","Howlin Wolf","12 March 2001","It's been a while since we've had a blockbuster live up to the hype. This did, despite there being little hype to speak of originally. Now everyone is talking about it, and with good reason. The cast and crew have turned in a fine film.Crowe is magnificent as the central figure of Maximus. Along with an imposing figure, he brings acting skill to the role when many would have simply been tempted to essay the 'action hero' caricature we've seen many times before. Crowe is wonderfully competent at being both the classic 'hero' type and the man with a bit more depth behind the brawn. This role must surely have taken him to the front ranks of Hollywood's leading men.Many of the other cast members perform extremely well too. Joaquin Phoenix delivers the sort of complex interpretation a figure of history such as Commodus doubtless deserves. No matter how much we may be rooting for Maximus, occasionally we feel sympathetic towards Commodus when he is at his most pitiful. This is a fine balance though, as never is any pity we may feel allowed to overshadow the fact that Commodus can also be spectacularly evil. I shall be watching the career of Phoenix more closely on the evidence of this performance.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Often, the efforts of the actresses go unnoticed in relation to their more high profile male counterparts. Not here, Connie Nielsen is also superb as a quiet heroine who the audience can will to get together with the hero.Oliver Reed is fine in his last role, but it is Richard Harris, who, as a member of the 'old guard', reminds us all that he's been doing this sort of thing effortlessly since Crowe was in nappies (probably...) A bravura performance.Ridley Scott, meanwhile, appears to relish a project of this magnitude. The CGI recreation of the Collosseum is magnificent, but Scott never lets such an impressive element detract from the moments of pure drama to be found in David H. Franzoni's script. Instead, he mixes astonishing set pieces with moments of human interaction seamlessly, creating a thoroughly nourishing and rewarding cinematic experience.Proof that they might just make 'em as good as they used to...?",NA
"Gladiator","sme_no_densetsu","30 June 2009","Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" tells the story of a betrayed Roman general (Russell Crowe) who is thrust into the life of a gladiator. He lives for the day that he can exact revenge on the man responsible for the murder of his wife and child, the emperor himself (Joaquin Phoenix).The film harks back to the sort of big-budget historical epics that died out in the mid-sixties. Therefore, it isn't surprising that the script's strength isn't originality. The plot borrows elements of ""Ben-Hur"" & ""Spartacus"" and supposedly also draws heavily from ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"", which I haven't seen.Regardless of this lack of originality, the film does manage to present us with a compelling story of a type that had been absent from movie screens for too long. Also, with the advances in CGI, the filmmakers were able to fully realize the epic scope that such a story deserves. While the script may misstep a few times it nevertheless presents an intelligent story effectively balancing action and political intrigue.The cast is solid. Russell Crowe won an Oscar for his work here, which is a bit surprising to me. It's a good performance as far as action-oriented drama goes, but I don't think that it's outstanding by any means. I think that Joaquin Phoenix fared better as the conniving emperor but he only managed an Oscar nomination among some tough competition. The rest of the cast is generally above-average, featuring a number of talented individuals like Djimon Hounsou & Richard Harris.Ridley Scott's direction is skillfully handled and resulted in a well-deserved Oscar nomination. The attractive cinematography & crisp editing were also recognized with Oscar nominations. The visual effects deservedly won an Oscar, as did the costume design, while the art direction scored another Oscar nomination. These plaudits should make it clear that this is a film showing considerable care in all areas of visual presentation.A further Oscar nomination resulted from Hans Zimmer's score while the sound design scored another Oscar win. Very rarely do I notice sound design in a film but in this case I did.I'd say that, more than anything, the high quality of every technical aspect of the film went a long way in securing the film's Best Picture Oscar win. As for my own opinion, I think that the film represents a rare commodity: A crowd-pleasing film that also shows considerable technical prowess.",NA
"Gladiator","preppy-3","15 May 2000","That about describes the movie...the plot is by the number, the movie is too long by about 1/2 hour, it's needlessly loud and it's very bloody (which is to be expected).  The only real reasons to see the film: Crowe's great performance (and body) even if he does slip into his Australian accent ocassionally and director Scott's incredible visuals.  Also worth seeing is Oliver Reeds' final performance (he's very good).  All the other acting is OK, but the story is just so drawn out and I was always one step ahead of it.  The fight scenes are incredible, but those sequences don't make up for the rest of the movie.  Wait for the video.",NA

Gladiator has heart and soul as well as action and the big themes of right and wrong, fairness and justice and dignity for all no matter what your station in life is.Films about Ancient Rome are often intriguing for the ruthlessness and backstabbing and changing loyalties . Making money is often above doing what is right it's also about survival. Gladiator has all that but also feels like a smaller more intimate film .

"Gladiator","dunmore_ego","6 March 2009","Truly GLADIATOR is the stuff of great fiction; a story so well-orchestrated and superbly told, there might well have been in Roman history a general who became a slave, a slave who became a gladiator, a gladiator who defied an emperor.But - as they used to say in ancient Rome - ""only in Hollywood...""Russell Crowe is Ancient Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of a fierce and loyal army that has conquered the known world under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (regal, world-weary Richard Harris). Maximus plans to retire to his olive gardens with wife and son, but the sickly Emperor has other ideas, bequeathing Maximus the stewardship of Rome over that of his natural-born son and rightful heir, the fey Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). When Commodus discovers this slight, he cries a little, promptly kills his father, arrests Maximus, and gets progressively feyer.Commodus then invents the James-Bond-Batman-Death, that is, don't kill your nemesis quickly and efficiently in full view, order your incompetent men to take him somewhere and probably kill him if he doesn't use his dangerous ingenuity and superior combat skills to escape. This also guarantees you are completely in the dark as to whether your enemy is dead, until he appears unexpectedly somewhere and vexes you.This Maximus does, defying Commodus and leaving him terribly vexed.Thereby arriving at Part Three of the slogan. In the interim, Maximus discovered his family was crucified by Commodus, which caused Maximus untold Academy Award-Winning Acting, subsequently collapsing in the desert and taken into slavery. The Gladiator merchant, Proximo (Oliver Reed, gravel-throated, rheumy-eyed - his last performance before going to that great arena in the sky) handpicks the indifferent yet lethal Maximus to join his stable of gladiators (which includes neighborly Numidian, Djimon Hounsou and man-mountain Ralf Moeller). Proximo scores a gig at The Coliseum, for the pleasure of now-Emperor Commodus.As Darth Vader thoomed, ""The circle is now complete."" There were arena skirmishes before this one, but the Coliseum ""Carthage reenactment"" is the grandest rock star battle for Proximo's now-renowned gladiator troop, inspired and led by Maximus, as stirring and blood-pounding as BEN-HUR's chariot race. GLADIATOR's raucous, blood-glutted battle scenes are fitting successors to the ""realistic"" warfare of BRAVEHEART and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.""Are you not entertained?"" His helmet disguising his identity, Maximus rallies ""his"" gladiators to defeat the lethal Imperial chariot-riders in the arena, to the surprise of Commodus, who wishes to meet the upstart who would not even salute the throne, let alone die conveniently for the public's pleasure. Maximus reveals himself to Commodus, who is driven to remarkable heights of feyness.Discovering Maximus is alive makes not only Commodus weak in the knees - so too his sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), who pined for him back when her father the Emperor owned Maximus's taut butt. Her betrayal of Commodus sets in motion the third act, steeped in politics of reclaiming Rome as a republic, and therefore losing some of its verve.Beautifully filmed, in ocher tones and burnt umber (by director Ridley Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson), GLADIATOR nabbed Russell Crowe a Best Actor Oscar - even though Joaquin Phoenix did all the actual acting! Crowe pulls the Bruce Willis for most of the film, while Phoenix's sway-tilt emotions are a disturbing rainbow of subtlety.Phoenix's performance is absolutely stunning - that of a weak man, filled with disillusionment, contempt, envy, indecision; conflicting emotions constantly dancing across his face, flickers of smiles when we know he wants to cry humiliation, edging tears when we know he would rather lash out like the simple animal he is. It is Acting of a caliber few writers or directors could even describe, let alone trust an actor to convey.""What we do in life echoes in eternity."" Well. maybe, depending on what eternity you're talking about. For all its awe-inspiring action and chest-beating man-sweatiness, GLADIATOR has its faults: writers David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson can't figure what ancient civilization they're writing for. These are ROMANS, boys. So when Maximus pep talks his men at the very first battle ""...if you find yourself alone, riding in green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled, for you are in Elysium - and you are already dead!,"" his troops should have replied, ""Excuse sir, but isn't that where GREEKS go?"" In his prayers, Maximus appeals to a ""Blessed Father"" - Jupiter? Janus? GLADIATOR pulls no punches when depicting the slaughter of countless of god's creations, yet is too gutless to depict polytheism. Especially in the Lead Actor with the Oscar push.When Maximus prays to the effigies of his wife and son and the Numidian asks, ""What do you say to them?"" he answers, ""To my son - I tell him I will see him again soon. To keep his heels down while riding his horse. To my wife... that is not your business."" Big bonding laugh. Let me get this straight: he's joking about sticking it to his raped and crucified wife in the afterlife? Is that not inappropriate? Are you not entertained? ""It vexes me. I'm terribly vexed."" Phoenix all in white, Gladiator stumbling from a stab wound and seeing his predestination Christian homecoming, Jumilla giving a eulogy that makes our flesh crawl, the Numidian (who had his own religious beliefs) succumbing to the Christian myths (after all, they are the right ones, of course! Not like those other stupid religions, which Christians are still trying to wipe off the face of the Earth) and sotto voce, ""We will see each other again - but not yet!""...Apparently, Gladiator is ""going home."" Believe in a myth hard enough and it will come true.Hail Caesar and all that. Romani Ite Domum.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",NA
"Gladiator","rupie","31 August 2000","I first watched this movie 22 years ago, and only just now have I given it another viewing. Wow. It's the same movie so I guess I'm just not the same person. Perhaps I was so enthusiastic at the time because I was happy to see Hollywood make a ""historical"" (more on that later) epic rather than another slasher or car chase fest.Watching it now I was comparing it with the great sword & sandal flicks of the 50's - Ben Hur, Spartacus, The Egyptian, et.al. This effort doesn't come anywhere close. Maybe part of it is that the computer effects simply don't compare with real imagery.As far as historical accuracy, excuse me, but WHAT historical accuracy? Many viewers have pointed out the egregious errors and outright falsities perpetrated here. Yes, I know it's a film, not a documentary, but there is a point at which falsity becomes so egregious it disqualifies the movie, and this flick passes that point.The death scene between Marcus Aurelius and Commodus - aside from the fact that there is zero evidence Commodus killed his father - is simply laughable. ""If only you'd hugged me."" ""I failed as a father."" Such talk is emblematic of the age of Freud and Joyce Brothers, not the age of Cicero and Pliny. Romans at the time would scratch their heads at such talk.And then we have the execrable music which falls flat compared to the great scores of Miklos Rozsa and Alex North.So I guess the 22 years since I last watched this dog (I'm seventy-six now) have made me a whole lot fussier.",NA
