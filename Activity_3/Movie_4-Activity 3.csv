","UniqueParticle","16 January 2020","So much amazing action and beautiful cinematography makes for such an enlightening experience! In The Empire Strikes Back you know who everyone is which is great plus Yoda is introduced! I love this movie the music is soothing, there's romance, more of Darth Vader, and introduces Emperor Palpatine what more can you ask for? A lot to relish and get excited about; it's such a classic gem.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","bob the moo","27 June 2002","The Rebellion has struck an important blow to the power of the Empire by destroying it's Death Star, however the power of the Dark Side of the Force remains strong and continues to hunt the rebellion.  While the Rebellion base on Hoth is under treat, Luke has gone to a distant swamp planet to receive further Jedi training from Master Yoda.  However the power of the dark side should not be underestimated and many dark truths are revealed as the threat of the Empire looms large.Following Star Wars was never going to be easy but this is actually better. Empire retains the same characters and the same sense of fun that the first had  the battle on Hoth is just one of THE moments of the series.  However what gets added to that is a much darker strand.  The Empire is not beaten by the destruction of one ship  it's power is barely dented in fact.  This sees some startling revelations (I won't spoil it in case you've been living under a rock!) but also sees significant blows to the rebellion.  In fact the ending of this film could not be more different from the end of Star Wars.Like the recent episode two this follows two strands  the more pedestrian scenes with Luke and Yoda and the more action based scenes with Han and company.  The scenes with Yoda add depth to the film and hint at the truth. Meanwhile the other half is a lot more action orientated and has comedy and good new characters such as Bobba Fett.  The two work well together and come together well for a great finale.  The addition of a dark strand to the film makes it all the better as it can be enjoyed as a story and not just a fun sci-fi film with good effects.The characters are better here than the first.  The strong characters from the first (Han, C3P0 et al) are all still good here.  However we also get a much more interesting version of Luke as he continues his journey into becoming a full Jedi.  Yoda is a good addition (despite sounding like Fozzie Bear!) and Darth Vader becomes a lot more than just a good villain  we learn his past, a revelation then, but a thing of common knowledge now.Overall this is as good as Star Wars at it's heart, but the darker nature of the film makes it much better.  Where the first one was a victorious uprising this is, as the title suggests, the time in history where the Empire strikes back against the uprising.  All the music, characters and things that make Star Wars Star Wars are here and it's simply one of the best of the series to date.","

","ivo-cobra8","25 April 2016","Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is an excellent timeless classic that it is the best sequel of all time. I love this film to death, it is my second favorite film and the best sequel in the Star Wars franchise that I love. The Empire Strikes Back is a movie that it is one of the best sequels I can think of, it is right there with Aliens (1986), it is right there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) it is an excellent sequel and it really does establish The Empire as a value treat. Empire Strikes Back is still and excellent film which I really believe is a timeless classic. This is my second favorite film from director Irvin Kershner. Number 1 favorite Irvin Kershner film will be RoboCop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. I still have to review those movies someday.Empire Strikes Back (1980) is the best one of the series, because it's deeper, darker, more philosophical. It's great because Darth Vader and the Empire are at their most menacing, the direction is creative, the characters feel real, the nature of the Force is explored more without losing its mysticism, and the pacing is, as George Lucas would put it, faster and more intense than any other film in the saga.The plot is actually more a rescue mission that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is coming to rescue his friends Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca are captured on a planet Bespin in Cloud City from villainous Darth Vader. Han Solo's friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) set the up and with Darth Vader he set a trap for Luke. Also Luke studied the Force under Jedi Master Yoda to become a full Jedi Knight but in the end he must confront Darth Vader (David Prowse) by him self. The origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled.Empire Strikes Back was released in 1980 it is directed by Irvin Kershner this time and not George Lucas. Because George Lucas decide that he want to make this sequel independent one, so he ended up coming with his own, founding for the film. Getting a loan and money he earn from the first movie and it success, so he decided he wanted, to found the film him self, and he wanted to be more an executive producer to keep an eye on the lamp, he moved to a bigger studio in Orange County, California, so he diced to be more a producer he did not want to direct Empire Strikes Back. So his first choice was Irvin Kershner, who was a professor at UC in the UC film school, that George attended too and he always liked Irvin Kershner and of course he was a former professor and it was a hard way talk him to do it and the first time Irvin Kershner didn't want to do it, so George called Irvin's agent and his agent said to Irvin take it so he did and the rest is a history. This stands the test of time, the best film he ever directed! I love John Williams score still the same, but I think John Williams changed the music score for a little bit, but that's just my opinion.Things that I love in this film: I love the battle with Rebels fighting with the Imperial AT-AT walkers on the ice world of Hoth. That is my favorite scene on ice world in the film. The Imperial AT-AT walkers are incredible well made with classic special effects.I love that the origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled, that Luke is the son of Darth Vader, who is actually Anakin Skywalker, before he become Darth Vader and went to the dark site.For the first time ever, we see an Emperor in a Hologram talking to Darth Vader.The Falcon with Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca hiding in the rocks try's to eat a monster.Luke faces with Darth Vader him self face to face and get his arm cut off and then he jumps off the bridge, because he didn't want to join his father in a dark force. The lightsaber duel throughout the chamber between Luke and Darth Vader was excellent and it was epic.The training sequence with Luke and master Yoda were excellent and epic. A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back are my favorite films in series, that are in the franchise, this film get's a perfect 10 score for been the best sci-fi adventure sequel of all time.","

","TxMike","7 October 2004","My five children were all pre-teens when 'The Empire Strikes Back' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.It is fruitless trying to argue 'which is best' in a trilogy, because the first one, in this case 'Star Wars', starts it all and has to be the 'father'. However, an argument can be made that 'The Empire Strikes Back' (now on DVD called Episode V) is overall a better-made movie which has more excitement, and grabs your imagination,than the other two original installments (now called parts IV and VI). The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them.","

","Sleepin_Dragon","18 September 2023","Luke Skywalker goes in search of Jedi Master Yoda, to begin his Jedi training, meanwhile his friends and fellow band of rebels are pursued by The Empire's forces.How on Earth was it possible to match, if not surpass Episode IV, it seems unfathomable, well that's exactly what they did with this remarkable movie, and whilst I personally rank the films on par with one another, I get why some favour this one. For me, the first came out of nowhere, whereas for this second one, expectations would have been incredibly high.A superb storyline, breathtaking visuals, first class acting, and Yoda, what more could anyone possibly want or need from a movie, it's a bold claim, but I would genuinely say this is one of the greatest films of all time.The sets are unbelievable, you can really tell that for those involved this was definitely a labour of love, everything was precise and on point.It's worth a 10/10 for Yoda alone, I adore his and Luke's scenes together. The wonderful voice of Frank Oz adds a great deal, it really does help to make Yoda such an amazing, funny, smart and curious character.Let's be honest, films don't get much better than this, it really is a masterpiece.10/10.","

","SnoopyStyle","6 May 2016","After the destruction of the Death Star, the Rebel Alliance has been hounded by the Empire. Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, and Han Solo are with the Rebel forces on the secret base on the planet Hoth. Darth Vader locates the base driving the rebels on the run. Leia, Chewie, and Han with C-3PO escape on the Millennium Falcon eventually ending up in Lando Calrissian's Cloud City. Meanwhile, Luke goes to the Dagobah system and finds Jedi Master Yoda.There are superior popcorn movies in the Star Wars franchise although there is plenty of eye-popping action in this one. This is the best overall film in the series. The dialog is snappier. The combative romance between Leia and Han is the best. Everything looks great. It introduces Yoda and Lando. There are great legendary twists. It is a Star Wars movie for film fans. Even the Special Edition is the best of the original trio. There may be one or two stiff additions but most of them actually help. There are so many incredible moments in this.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","Spleen","26 October 1999","`It avoids having the standard shoot-'em-up ending,' says a friend of mine, `by not having an ending.'  I suppose this is what most people think, but all the same the film manages to form a satisfying whole; or at least, a whole that satisfies me.  I'm therefore inclined to think it DOES have an ending.  Obviously, I can't discuss this without giving things away to those few who don't know what happens.  If you're one of those few, then believe me: your ignorance is precious enough to be worth guarding until you see the film.  Stop reading now.After the surprise attack on the rebel base, Luke Skywalker splits with Han, Leia, et al.  Han's party gets away first (is it just me, or is the shot of Luke watching the Falcon flying off while he stands stranded on the ground, a poignant one?), but thereafter they face one narrow escape after another, while Luke slinks off quietly and safely to train with Yoda.The training scenes are many and Yoda talks a great deal of rubbish.  But somehow it doesn't matter.  The film is ambivalent in its attitude towards Yoda, anyway.  Our sympathy clearly lies with the entirely non-spiritual concerns of Han, Leia and the adolescent Luke.  The main story concerns the understanding that builds between Han and Leia.  In the end they are honest with one another; and if Han's being frozen and shipped back to Tatooine is the price to pay for this, well, it's the price to pay.  It was very important NOT to end with the dashing rescue that opens `Return of the Jedi', which would be dramatically beside the point.  Instead we end with the promise that the rescue will some day occur.  That's enough.As for Luke: he abandons Yoda to rescue Han and Leia, and achieves NOTHING WHATEVER.  This was my favourite touch.  All five Jedis - Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Vader, and the Emperor - find that their conflicting instincts are all entirely wrong.  The film is really about the temporary triumph of human impulses over the mystical Force.  Luke's human idealism is vindicated, but his supernatural powers, just this once, are not.When George Lucas gave his Star Wars trilogy a fresh coat of varnish in 1997 he felt he had to justify the expense by making needless changes.  You'll notice he made precious few changes to episode V.  There just wasn't room. He added a few extra shots of the ice monster, which of course weakened that one scene; but even with those changes in place the Special Edition is virtually identical to the original edition.  Since Lucas was so keen on making changes wherever he could this is obviously a tribute to the tightness of the story and the direction.  It's also a tribute to the perfection of the original special effects, more innovative than the effects in the first Star Wars movie and better than the effects in any subsequent one.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","Anonymous_Maxine","6 August 2002","In a film like The Empire Strikes Back, especially a few years on the heels of such a mind-bogglingly great film like the original Star Wars, there is something that comes immediately to mind that would at first seem to count against the film, but instead only winds up increasing the respect that it commands. In the 1977 Star Wars, there is a clear reliance on simplicity in some parts. Obviously, it is much more than a simply made science fiction film, but like I said in my review of it, there was a lot of highly effective reliance on things that were not put on screen, such as Obi Wan's description of The Force to Luke. In The Empire Strike Back, the first thing that we are treated to is the traditional scrolling text along a background of stars, depicting what has happened between the last film and this one, and reminding us of the things that were mentioned in the last film but never explained.At first, this would almost seem to be a way to save money to get more information across to the audience without having to actually put it on screen, but this is really an ingenious way of furthering the story. The very fact that we are so willing to read all this information and forgive our inability to actually see it is a testament to the quality of the series, even at this early stage in its presentation, and we know the story so well from the first film that we are glad to see such a large change in what's happening in the films, not for a second lamenting the fact that we have obviously missed so much action. And besides that, if and when George Lucas runs out of new prequels to release, and maybe if he someday begins to run low on how many hundreds of millions of dollars he has, he could go right back and make these in-between scenes into full length films. What would he call these, if he did that? Introquels? Who cares! The names themselves would be interesting enough, and if you go back and read the stuff that introduces this film, it's obvious that there's an entire film there just waiting to be made. I guess the question of actors would be a formidable one, though.The Empire Strikes Back is the film where we are first introduced to the great Jedi master Yoda (`Away put your weapon!'), as well as some of the most thrilling battle sequences of the entire Star Wars series, and that includes the prequels. The battle scene where the rebels fight the Imperial Walkers on the ice planet is an incredibly well-made battle scene, not only in the way that it was put together so convincingly using models, but that the machines themselves are so creatively made. Indeed, the Imperial Walkers are some of the most recognizable machines from the entire Star Wars saga, right up there with the Millennium Falcon and the Death Star.
I have just watched this film again, having already seen Episode I and Episode II, and not having seen any of the original Star Wars films for maybe 10 years (except for the original 1977 Star Wars, which I saw and reviewed a few days ago - and these aren't even the Special Edition versions!). When I first saw Yoda when watching The Empire Strikes Back again, I was really struck by how different he looked from in the newer movies. Obviously, he's completely computer generated in the new films, but here in Episode V he looks like a muppet! Even so, I would like to express my opinion that Yoda is more realistic and more interesting here as a puppet than in the newer films as a computer generated image. At least here in the older films you know that he's actually THERE, and that he's not just added into the film later.Oh yeah, speaking of Yoda, can I just complain for a minute? What the hell was up with the Jedi training? Yes, I realize that I'm just a lowly IMDb reviewer, while The Empire Strikes Back is a part of the greatest science fiction series of all time, but would it have killed George Lucas to write in a little more creative training for Luke? The thing that struck me first about the Star Wars films when I first started watching them was how incredibly imaginative they were, but then Luke started his training. You know, when I was in high school I played football. I was a wide receiver/tight end and I hardly ever got to play because I was too tall and too skinny, but part of my workout was to carry the linemen up and down the stairs to the weight room. Some of these guys weighed 100 pounds more than me, and I still almost never saw the field, and here's Luke Skywalker. He carries Yoda around this boggy swamp and he gets to be a Jedi! What the hell!There is also the addition of a surprisingly fitting love story. First of all, anyone who has ever read my review of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie will know that I am not the biggest fan of cramming a love story into a movie where it doesn't belong. I can't seem to write anything about Bruckheimer movies without complaining about the idiot love story, and now it's even worse because here's this movie that was made so long before, from which Bruckheimer could obviously have at least learned a LITTLE bit about how to do it right. Han Solo and Princess Leia maintain the personalities that they developed in the first Star Wars film and there is now a sort of love/hate relationship between the two of them, where neither one of them wants to admit their feelings for the other. This romantic subplot is characterized perfectly in the scene just before Solo is carbon frozen, when Leia risks approaching a cheesy romantic moment by saying `I love you' just before Han is lowered into the freezing chamber, and he saves the moment by responding, `I know.' Han Solo. Smart-ass to the last drop.Before I end I would like to point out that the goofs that can be found on the IMDb for this film are some of the most blatant that I've ever seen in a film. The scene where you can see someone giving a woman at the tactical maps a cue to deliver her lines is amazingly obvious, and some of the other ones, such as the stage hand swinging the light saber prop briefly into view as he switches it for an `off' prop with Luke just after he knocks Darth Vader over backwards, are just as much fun to look for. I have one question about the goofs, though. There's one where Luke looks off into the fog just after R2-D2 is eaten by the sea monster, and you can CLEARLY see a person running to the right a little ways off in the fog. Is that meant to be Luke? It seems that it's supposed to be him running in his search for R2, because you can even hear the FOOTSTEPS of the person running. I can't even IMAGINE how they could have missed THAT!!It is, however, a testament to the quality of a film when such tremendous oversights in editing do nothing to take away from the overall quality of the film. The Empire Strikes Back remains an extremely powerful and well-made installment in the Star Wars series, not taking even a single step backwards in the sheer breathtaking adventure of the original film. It's not often that a film as good as Star Wars can be released and then followed up with a sequel that is just as great, as is clearly the case here. Star Wars was a gigantic film upon its release, and with The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas has begun the formation of one of the greatest film series' in cinematic history.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","TheNorthernMonkee","22 May 2005","SPOILERS Three years after ""Star Wars"", creator George Lucas released the second part of his trilogy. Giving scripting credits to Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasden, as well as directing to Irvin Kershner, Lucas made his smartest ever decision and as a result was able to release the finest film of the trilogy by a mile. Considerably darker and more mature than it's predecessor, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a masterpiece of modern film. It is an intense, powerful, entertaining film with the ultimate cinema twist and with a script worthy of it's potential.After the events of the first film, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) are now members of the rebel alliance. Hidden on a frozen planet, the rebels hide from the domineering glow of the Empire. All is not well however as the evil Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) is on his way to find them.Easily the best of the trilogy, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" has so much going for it. A wonderful plot, an equally good script with some brilliant lines (even actor Harrison Ford joining in with a line or two of his own) and special effects to match, this film is a glowing example of why people love the trilogy so much.Since George Lucas passed on the major responsibilities for this film, we are given a more professional, well made film for our attention and Lucas's vision is better off for it. With it's recent remastering, it is also the only film in the trilogy to not be damaged by Lucas' tampering. Extra images are added, graphics are honed, but nothing major is changed. As a result the film appears to us to be no different from it's original self.Darker and more mature as well, this sequel is better than the original ""Star Wars"" because it isn't so black and white. Presenting the evil Darth Vader as a more balanced individual, we don't quite have the confused Vader of the final chapter, but we are beginning to get signs that he isn't quite as we expected.This second part also gives us the finest performance ever by one of the universes most important characters. Still a rubber puppet with bendy ears, Jedi Master Yoda is introduced in this film as a creature of wit and intelligence. Voiced by Frank Oz, Yoda is brilliant because of his lines. Legendarily possessing of an obsession for splitting sentences up and rehashing them together, Yoda very often speaks normally throughout this film. Occasionally demonstrating his penchant for bad English, he does make a few minor errors, but ultimately it is up to the later scripts of George Lucas to corrupt Yoda's style and turn this wonderful character into an annoying figure of fun.There's no real way to fault ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The finest part of the original trilogy, this film is amazing because it is professionally done. Nobody would ever deny that George Lucas did something wonderful when he thought up ""Star Wars"", but unfortunately for a lot of the films, Lucas always insisted on too much control. A dire writer of scripts, Lucas can destroy his films by making them infuriating to watch. In this part though, Lucas didn't get involved and as a result, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a masterpiece in it's own right.","

","TheLittleSongbird","29 November 2009","The original trilogy of Star Wars contain three films, all of which are sophisticated, imaginative and enormous fun. I feared it wouldn't be my thing, but it was exactly that. I loved the original trilogy for all those reasons. Empire Strikes Back maintains all the fun of its predecessor, while even darker and more mature. Visually it's a marvel to look at, with the stunning special effects and highly imaginative-looking sets. John Williams's score is just outstanding, epic and monumental in every way. The story is darker than that of New Hope and perhaps more sophisticated, and I loved the fact the filmmakers made the romance between Leia and Han more developed. The battle sequences are mesmerising, the beginning is bound to have you on the edge of your seat, but the battle between Luke and Darth Vader was simply out of this world. The script is still as affectionate as ever, the pace is fast and the acting is great. Mark Hamill is ever as likable as Luke, and Carrie Fisher still has her spunk and vivacity. Harrison Ford is noticeably more subdued, but he is still terrific, and Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda. Chewabacca is hilarious, and Darth Vader is a fantastic villain, especially when voiced so magnificently by James Earl Jones. All in all, a perfect successor to an already brilliant first film. 10/10 Bethany Cox","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","MovieAddict2016","3 April 2004","(Note: This review contains some spoilers.)Movie novelty quickly wears thin, which is why so many sequels pale in comparison to their originals. ""Star Wars: Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"" is the best of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, darker and deeper and even more powerful than the first film. Granted, the original pioneered an endless saga of imitators and somewhat imaginative knock-offs, and is still one of the greatest films ever made, but ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a tiny inch ahead in the race.It is the dark middle chapter in an almost perfect trilogy, crammed full with imagination and special effects. It is simply one of the most visionary movies of all time, which is rare for a sequel -- any sequel -- especially in the case of a sci-fi film. Just take a look at ""Predator 2"" for an example of an idea running out of steam, or a director who cannot cope with his script.The film generally picks up where the last left off: Luke (Mark Hamill) saved the day by blowing up the Death Star, the heroes were awarded with medals by the princess (Carrie Fisher), and peace was temporarily restored. But Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones) is still alive, and the Emperor's fury grows stronger as Luke begins his Jedi training under the help of Yoda. Meanwhile, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Leia flee to Cloud City to escape an attack from the empire, where they are taken under the wing of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), an old pal of Han's who is secretly working for Vader, somewhat against his own will.The movie is strong in its morals and Biblical metaphors, just as the original. Luke is the savior, Calrissian could be considered the equivalent of Judas, Han Solo is one of Luke's good disciples and Vader represents pure evil. And of course, there's the truly iconic line, ""I am your father,"" that is relevant to the devil, who -- according to the scriptures -- was an angel before being cast into the bowels of hell and becoming Lucifer.
Lucas admittedly used these various metaphors to strike a nerve in the subconscious of his viewers. Like all good fables, of fantasy or reality, ""Star Wars"" is a trilogy that relates to just about everyone, in one form or another, and is -- at its roots -- a story we are all very familiar with. It is the ever-familiar notion of good-vs. -evil at its core that helps propel these movies into the hearts of many. Yes, ""Star Wars"" is the quintessential nerd's film, engulfed in an entirely different dimension, but the film's bad rap for this is undeserved -- it's still a wonderful story, and you don't have to be a die-hard fan to appreciate its fine points (and it has many).One of the most popular legends (and misconceptions) regarding the ""Star Wars"" phenomenon is that George Lucas helmed the entire Star Wars trilogy, when in fact he only directed the first and wrote the screenplay for all three combined. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is directed by Irvin Kirshner, who also delivered us the disappointing ""RoboCop 2."" How could one sequel be so great, and the other so bad? Simple: Kirshner's darkness in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" had a point, and a high value. In ""RoboCop 2,"" it was just excessive and silly, not to mention totally unnecessary. What Paul Verhoeven was able to do with the original ""RoboCop"" was something not many films can accomplish, and Kirshner tried to add on to this with a darker narrative, which only ended in a frustratingly empty motion picture.""The Empire Strikes Back"" has a point amidst the action, and is the most important of all three ""Star Wars"" movies. It has the famous introduction of the creature Yoda, who sits tucked away in his hut on a swamp planet, at first startling Luke with his strange features, and then with his subtle wisdom. It is Yoda who trains Luke in the ways of the Jedi, and eventually leads him towards his destination: The showdown with Vader, when the infamous secret is finally revealed.The movie is expertly crafted, both in terms of a a narrative and literal context. From beginning to end it is darker, fiercer and more powerful than the original film, which is not an easy feat. All trilogies have their dark areas, and this is usually the middle chapter (""Back to the Future Part II"" is a good example), yet in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" the darkness seems very appropriate given the material. It is a film that dwells long and hard on betrayal, murder, revenge, and unrecoverable mistakes. By the end of the movie, we know what Luke is feeling: There is still much to be done, despite an overwhelming emotional downpour of attachment and confusion. For us, as an audience, we know everything must come to an end within the next installment. For Luke, it could be an eternity of struggle. But we all know there will be an end to the epic saga, and we have always known this, ever since we first caught a glimpse of a younger, more innocent Luke working for his uncle on that deserted planet, so many years ago, when he could only dream of having adventures in other galaxies far, far away...5/5 stars.John Ulmer","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","kevin_robbins","21 March 2022","The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched again on Disney+. The storyline picks up where Star Wars left off with the rebellion building their army and the evil Empire rebounding from losing the Death Star. Luke will try to master the powers of the force by searching for a new Jedi to train him; meanwhile, as he digs into his past he discovers more about how he became a Jedi to begin with.This movie is directed by Irvin Kershner (Robocop 2) and stars Mark Hamill (Sushi Girl), Harrison Ford (Clear and Present Danger), Carrie Fisher (Sorority Row), Billy Dee Williams (Nighthawks) and James Earl Jones (Coming to America).The Empire Strikes Back was always one of my favorites in the original trilogy. The opening yeti scene was fantastic and a great way tp start the film. The Princess and Hans scenes were hilarious and the banter makes you laugh no matter how many times you've seen it. Yoda is a legendary character introduced in this film and the Hans stasis scene is always sad. The final Luke vs Vader scene is also legendary and fun to watch unfold.Overall this is among the all time great science fiction movies that is an absolute must see. This is an easy 10/10.","

Will Luke be ready to face Darth Vader and save his friends? ""The Empire Strikes Back"", later retitled ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is a fantastic sequel of Star Wars, with a great story. The plot has adventure, romance, comedy and betrayal and is engaging until the very end. The characters now are more experienced and bonded. The mannerisms of C-3PO recalls Dr. Smith, from ""Lost in Space"". This is the type of sequel that keeps the high quality of the original film.

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","Lady_Targaryen","2 February 2006","''Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back '' is my favorite one from all the star war series.Things are getting more and more complicated for the Rebels.Spite of the fact that the Death Star was destroyed, the Imperial troops had success expelling the Rebels from their secret base, and now they are being hunted in all galaxy. The new secret base is localized in Hoth, a very cold world even for the native animals. Darth Vader wants to find Luke at any cost, and now he sent many remote probes to find him in all space. Luke is attacked by a big animal and almost dies, by stays lost in the ice. He sees the ghost of Obi Wan Kenobi talking with him, and he says that Luke needs to go to a system called Dangoba, where Yoda will teach and explain to him all the steps to become a Jedi. Han Solo goes after Luke and they both are saved by their rebel team.The system Hoth is discovered by the Empire(since it should not have any human form living in there) and consequently the Rebel Base. Darth Vader decides to attack the Rebels by the surface,and the Rebels really stay in disadvantage. Han,Leia,C3pO and Chewbacca escapes from Hoth,but after many attacks from the Imperial troops and even asteroids fields, they arrive in the Cloud city that Lando,an old friend of Han,rules.Luke goes with R2 to Dangoba,and there he finds Yoda. The problem is, Yoda does not want to teach him how to become a Jedi,since he finds Luke extremely impatient, old to be trained and also with many anger inside of him,like his father Anakin. Obi Wan tries to change Yoda's mind, but only when Luke promises to really gives his best that Yoda accepts the challenge.The Emperor talks to Vader about a disturbance in the force that comes from Luke Skywalker. He finally says that Luke is son of Anakin and that Luke should never be trained as a Jedi,because of the risk in destroying the siths,that are very high. But Vader has other plans: He always imagined that his offspring died when Padme died, and now he thinks about making Luke a sith,to they both rule the galaxy together and also kill the Emperor.In the city of the clouds, Lando betrays Han and gives them all to Vader.It's all a trap to take Luke that Vader did, and while he tortures Han, Lukes see the vision of his friends suffering,and gave up his training. Yoda alerts him that the risk of turning to the dark side is high, and that he should not stop his training, but Luke is so worried with his friends that he cannot think about anything else. Vader call the award hunters and Boba Fett(the clone of Jango Fett,remember?)is the one who takes Han Solo to Jabba,to win a big prize.We are now in a risky situation, where Lukes needs to confront his dad without be tainted to the dark side, and someone needs to help Han,Chewbacca,Leia and C3po.Ps: *In this movie we can see the first demonstrations that Leia and Han likes each other,and when Leia wants to let Han with jealous and kisses Luke is kind of a funny moment. Another nice moment with Leia, is when we see the connection between her and Luke, when he has his hand cut and is in a dangerous situation after fighting with Vader.*I really like the big Imperial robots called 'walkers': I think they are one of the most impressive artilleries the Empire has.","

","saveliydalmatov","30 December 2023","So, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a sequel to the previous part. After the release of the first episode, the budget, the fans appeared, and, accordingly, the quality improved!The fifth episode is the darkest and even the best in the original trilogy (in my personal opinion), and for many in the entire franchise.Here we will hear the famous Imperial March for the first time, learn all the greatness of the Empire under the leadership of Vader, as well as the formation of Luke as a Jedi.New characters have added color to the franchise, some have already become iconic and famous among many (the same Boba Fett).This fascinating story will feature plot twists (for sure many people understood what I was talking about) and a very addictive atmosphere of horror.As a result, this is what the fans needed - a successful sequel. And, of course, you need to look at it, it's a classic after all.My Rating : 10/10 (one of the best films)","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","Dissident","2 May 2000","The Empire Strikes Back is the best film in the original Star Wars trilogy. It has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great effects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of spellbinding action.  It also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development.  The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film.  The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series.  This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn't mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional.  This film will undoubtedly entertain viewers of all ages from start to finish.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","nickenchuggets","4 September 2022","It's obvious to most movie fans that Star Wars Episode IV deserves tons of praise for being the first in its respective series and also for spawning one of the biggest cultural phenomenons of all time, but in my view, The Empire Strikes Back is superior. I have seen someone state this already, but I will say it again here, as it is a very good reason why this movie is arguably better: character development. We get introduced to the main cast in A New Hope, but even by the end of that film, they're not fully fleshed out yet. We never really get to see how adept Luke is at using The Force, and Darth Vader, one of the most feared men in the galaxy, appears completely subservient to Peter Cushing's character, Grand Moff Tarkin. Episode V takes Star Wars in a risky direction, as Luke is separated from his friends for most of the runtime, but this decision totally paid off and I don't think the movie could have gone any better. The story picks up 3 whole years after Luke has destroyed the Death Star: the Empire's feared space station capable of obliterating entire planets. Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine, the two most powerful men in the Empire, send floating droids all over the galaxy to locate the secret base of the Rebel Alliance (the empire's enemy), under the command of Luke's sister Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Vader eventually finds what he's looking for and locates what looks like a stronghold on the frigid planet of Hoth. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is investigating an area around the rebel base and is attacked and nearly killed by a yeti-esque creature called a Wampa. Luke manages to slice off one of its arms with his lightsaber and is then rescued by Han Solo (Harrison Ford). Before being saved, Luke sees a vision of his late trainer, Obi-Wan (Alec Guinness) telling him to travel to a planet called Dagobah for some reason. Confident they have the rebel base in their sights, the Imperials launch a brutal onslaught on it using huge, walking, mechanized assault vehicles called AT AT's that decimate everything in their path. Luke and a few other rebels pilot rather slow spaceships known as snowspeeders in order to destroy the imperial walkers by tying their legs with tow cables and then blasting the weak armor on their neck joints. Despite their best efforts, the base is hit too hard and has to evacuate. Leia, Han, C-3PO, Chewbacca and R2D2 pile into the Millennium Falcon, Solo's rather mediocre but dependable starship, and fly off just as Vader enters the hangar. Luke doesn't regroup with his allies right away, and instead flies to the planet Dagobah as Obi-Wan's ghost told him to. Upon arriving in the planet's atmosphere, he loses control of his X-Wing and crashes into a swamp. Here, he meets Yoda, a centuries old Jedi Master who trains Luke in the way of the force. While Han and the others try to elude Vader's fleet of ships and star destroyers by weaving through asteroid fields, Luke expresses frustration at the difficulty of his training. He knows the force seems to be a magical aura of divine, supernatural energy that surrounds everything and inhabits all living beings, but he is not willing to put up with the time required to bend it to his will. Yoda makes things easier for him and uses his mastery over the force to easily lift Luke's crashed spaceship out of the swamp using only his mind. Luke quits his training early to pursue his friends to a planet called Bespin, since he can tell they're walking into a trap. Concurrently, Han Solo and the others arrive at Cloud City on bespin; a huge floating metropolis situated entirely in the sky. There, they meet Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), who is a no good smuggler (like Han) and an old acquaintance of his. While on cloud city, Lando reveals to the group that he's actually betrayed them to the empire. Vader, accompanied by the ruthless bounty hunter Boba Fett, take Han to a specialized chamber where he is frozen in carbonite so Boba can transport him to Jabba the Hutt for a reward. As the group (minus Solo) tries to fight their way out of cloud city, Luke comes face to face with Vader. Even with the force training he has received, Luke is no match for the dark lord's lightsaber proficiency and powerful strikes. Vader corners Luke, severs his hand, and reveals he is actually his father. Vader wants his son to join him so they can kill Palpatine together and end this galactic war, but Luke refuses and lets himself fall down a waste disposal chute that leads directly out of cloud city. Barely managing to hang on to a flimsy piece of metal, Leia senses something isn't right and flies underneath cloud city to rescue her brother. The ship jumps to hyperspace, slipping out of Vader's grasp once again. Back on a rebel medical ship, Luke receives an artificial right hand, and Lando promises to look for his friend Solo. Aside from the fact that this is a star wars movie, there are no doubt a ton of other reasons why it is worthy of adoration. Probably the most visually obvious reason are the special effects. Despite being over 4 decades old, this movie still looks great, and the effects will always look good no matter what year it is. The battle on hoth is amazing. We see the empire's enormous AT AT tanks, and how even their footsteps cause destruction. We see the millennium falcon get chased by massive, dagger shaped spaceships. Most of all, we see much appreciated character development. Luke still hasn't mastered all his force powers by the end of this movie, but he's come a long way thanks to Yoda. Speaking of which, Frank Oz did a great job puppeteering him and basically created one of cinema's most beloved characters. Even the villains are interesting and likable. Vader I believe needs no introduction, but he contrasts heavily with how he was in the first film. He's completely in control here and does what he wants, unlike in episode IV where Tarkin bosses him around, and episode VI where Palpatine does. While still a cool bad guy, it's always annoyed me how Boba Fett is consistently ranked as one of star wars' most popular characters, mostly just because of how he looks. He only has 4 lines in this entire movie, but he's still memorable for being one of the few people who can talk back to Vader and still be alive afterwards. It's not like I need to state the obvious, but John Williams' score really serves to make an epic film even more epic. All I have to say for my closing remark is that The Empire Strikes Back has clearly secured its place as one of the most well made star wars films, which should be common knowledge for any fan of this immortal franchise.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","morfunkel","21 August 2018","This film changed the game forever. The people behind the scenes took an exciting science fiction adventure film with a happy tone where the heroes have a happy tone throughout and throwing that on its side. Throughout the film the rebels are in a constant rush and panic, pushing the viewers to the edge of their seat wondering if the heroes would make it to the end okay. This is done brilliantly by splitting up the heroes putting them in a worried state for one another. As well as that the rebels are all tested as they go through their own personal trails and try to find their way through.
Even though this might put you on a constant worry for the characters the movie is paced perfectly with breathers and amazing storytelling by the characters to fill in anything we need answers for.
That is just the story, the film also has gorgeous cinematography, going from the AT-ATs on Hoth, to the Imperial pursuit of the Falcon through the asteroid field, all the way down to the beautiful shots of the final battle in Cloud city. Even though we as viewers are worried for the rebels, the imagery is jaw dropping. 
The imagery is further enhanced by the most popular score of all time, John Williams delivers his best work ever as it has stuck with people their entire lives and is recognizable by even those who haven't seen the film. 
The film was released in 1980 and all of the set design and special effects still hold up to this day as they are just as convincing now as it was apon first watch for everyone in the past 38 years.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","Ithaqua1987","17 December 2004","An excellent sequel to Star Wars, this is easily the darkest and most serious out of all the Star Wars films, at least until Revenge of the Sith comes out. This movie benefits from the introduction of Yoda, a diminutive yet wise Jedi master who helps Luke prepare for his showdown with Darth Vader. It also introduces Lando Calrissian, Han's old gambling and smuggling buddy played very well by Billy Dee Williams. Empire is more character driven than the original and relies more on comic relief to help lighten the mood, but it doesn't go overboard with the humor. The story is more refined and the acting is better as well. Despite all of this I can't really say that I enjoyed Empire more than the original. The original Star Wars has a certain charm to it that none of the sequels (or prequels) have captured. I'd say that it is at least on par with the original though and is a fitting follow up in what is probably the greatest series of movies in the history of cinema.","

","BA_Harrison","3 March 2007","From it's opening scenes on the bleak ice-ball that is the planet Hoth, to its exciting finale on the cloud city of Bespin, The Empire Strikes back is a worthy sequel to the magnificent Star Wars. Taking over the directorial reins from George Lucas, Irvin Kershner steers the movie into darker territory to deliver a more mature movie than its predecessor.The Empire is still licking its wounds after the destruction of the Death Star, and evil Darth Vader is intent on finding the rebels responsible for destroying his new toy. Luke's aim, meanwhile, is to become a fully fledged Jedi knight, whilst Han sets himself a more difficult target: he plans on getting into Leia's knickers.With more incredible FX packed action scenes than you can shake a light-sabre at (highlights include the fantastic battle on Hoth, a chase scene through an asteroid field, and the Luke/Darth light-sabre duel), and THAT moment where we learn the truth about Luke's father, it's no surprise to find that this episode is often said to be the best of the series. Personally, A New Hope will always be my favourite (for sentimental reasons), but The Empire Strikes Back is a very close second.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","antonjsw1","12 September 2010","Congratulations have to go to line producer Gary Kurtz and director Irvin Kershner in pushing the production to out-perform A New Hope, even though the consequence was a film that came in massively over budget, and almost cost Lucas his hard fought independence from the Hollywood system.The plot moves quickly, from an interesting script by Leigh Bracket and Larry Kasdan, focusing on exploring two key relationships. The first is the relationship between Han Solo and Leia Organa, which is touched upon in a New Hope, but is fleshed out more in this film. The other is the more central relationship between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. This relationship is also linked in to the main supporting character in this film, Yoda, who is fantastically well realised by the film crew and performed brilliantly by Frank Oz. There are other characters, but whereas C3P0 and R2D2 were a central part of the story in the previous film, they are more on the sidelines.What makes this film so great though is the involving and effective way the relationships operate within the broader story. The banter between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is highly effective and amusing, operating through the classical love-hate relationship. One senses that Kershner, as a director of character driven films, worked very effectively with the actors and gave them the space to develop their characters which meant plenty of choices for the director in terms of their performances. The same goes for Mark Hamill's interaction with Yoda(Frank Oz). This is totally convincing and builds up the confrontation with Darth Vader very well. It was time well spent in getting these performances right. Kershner is very good at keeping the performance naturalistic, but reduces the level of broadness in the characters, making them more complex and interesting. Darth Vader benefits from this with scenes in the film that add to the mystique of the character. The confrontation with Luke Skywalker is riveting and dramatic and elevates the film above the level of its predecessor. Technically the film is even more impressive than its predecessor. Credit has to go the Oscar nominated Art Direction team. John Barry, who had worked on the previous film, passed away during the production, but Norman Reynolds led the team superbly, with the excellent creations of Dagobah and Hoth, albeit Bespin in the original does feel a bit like a set, and the digital embellishments in the special edition were helpful in creating a bigger feel to those scenes. However, I was disappointed in the reworked scene with Palpatine in the special edition - while putting the excellent Ian McDiarmid was supporting continuity, to show him face on was, in my view an error and the reworked scene would have played much better with his face shrouded, or at the least partially obscured. The whole point of the scene was that the dialogue as strong enough without the need to ram an unsubtle visual at the audience. Editing is excellent, led by Star Wars veteran Paul Hirsch, but it is known that both George Lucas, and his then wife Marcia were also heavily involved in putting the film together. Peter Suschitzky's photography is more conventional and low key in approach than A New Hope, but is particularly effective on the Dagobah scenes in Elstree Studios, and the location scenes in Norway. ILM's visual effects were outstanding, and rightly won an Academy Award. The crew consisted of the following: Oscar winning A New Hope veteran Richard Edlund, working with British effects supervisor Brian Johnson (who had just won an Oscar for Alien), effects photographer Dennis Muren (who would become an award winning and digital effects pioneer for ILM for ET, Return of the Jedi, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Innerspace, The Abyss, T2 and Jurassic Park) and compositor Bruce Nicholson, who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, and work on a wide variety of films in Hollywood. George Lucas took a strong interest and influence in the special effects and also has to take credit for some of the excellent sequences in the film, which also work because they help drive the story along. Again, like a New Hope, sound work was first rate and Oscar winning. In most cases the sound has to be recorded in a studio and added many months after filming has been completed. Sound re-recordist Bill Varney would win another Oscar for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Steve Maslow and Gregg Landaker also worked as sound-recordists and are both prolific contributors to many high profile movies. They would also win Oscars for their work on Raiders and then some fourteen years later win again for their work on the Keanu Reeves hit movie Speed. Peter Sutton won for his on–set work and has a large body of work in film since this movie. Also credit has to go the Ben Burtt's sound design work, which creates a fabulous sound-scape for the film.However, despite the above outstanding technical contributions, which serve to enhance and exciting and interesting story, it is composer John Williams who, yet again, takes this film to another level with another astounding musical score. Working with the director and producers, Williams develops and expands original themes. He creates a new and unforgettable theme for Darth Vader, with strong militaristic overtones, and clever themes for Leia and Han, and for Yoda. He weaves the score into the film expertly, giving moments of tension, excitement, thoughtfulness, mystery and tragedy with aplomb. The score feels more operatic than a New Hope, and helps cement this as one of the best adventure/fantasy films ever made. Congratulations to Mr Lucas for delivering a remarkable sequel, but also to Gary Kurtz and Irvin Kershner for having the courage to push everyone out of their comfort zones so as to reach this level of excellence.","

The optical effects still stand the test of time, and the acting is superb. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher are all better than they we in the original Star Wars, having fully developed and grown into their characters, and the story just keeps going and going, from asteroid fields to swamp planets to cities in the sky, everything in this film works.

","slokes","23 August 2005","After being abruptly evicted from his Death Star digs, Darth Vader seeks out the young rebel warrior responsible, Luke Skywalker. He has plans for the boy. Skywalker, meanwhile, leaves his friends in the middle of an Imperial invasion for a crash course in Jedi Knighthood amid a desolate swampworld with only a faultfinding green gnome for company. Can Luke complete his training before Darth reels him in?Well, no, actually. That's not the only way this middle installment of the ""Star Wars"" trilogy leaves things on a decidedly more discordant note than the previous, joyous ""Star Wars."" People call this the darkest of the original three films because it is, but ""Empire"" is the only one with an adult orientation. The characters are deepened, and our investment in them from the first film challenged by events that leave them exposed to the sort of cruelties we wrongly assumed them safe from.George Lucas deserves major praise for putting such a film together, using his well-earned profits from the first film. In essence, he was literally giving the fans back some dividends for their box office proceeds. He also took chances in terms of leaving them less happy this time, knowing the emotional payoff would have to come a film later.""Empire Strikes Back"" is thus a richer film than ""Star Wars"" emotionally, and in other ways, too. Instead of confining most of the action to the desert planet Tatoonie, the action bounces around from an ice planet to a swamp planet to the most marvelous creation of all, a city hovering high in the clouds of a gas giant, where the action culminates.Lucas adds some interesting new characters, particularly Yoda, the swamp creature Luke goes to for help, who articulates much of the philosophy and provides much of the fun in this film as voiced by Frank Oz, the guy behind (or under) Miss Piggy and later, a talented director in his own right.There's also Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, the operator of Cloud City who provides much of the needed moral shading in the film as the stars from the previous movie are all full-blown heroes now. Williams has fun schmoozing up Leia and trying to find his feet as his slick machinations leave him in ever-hotter water.The best performance in this film is Mark Hamill's as Luke. Hamill had to work harder here than he did in ""Star Wars,"" sharing all his big scenes with a Muppet and a guy with a bucket on his head. But Hamill finds the essence of a character more interesting than the naive farmboy we saw in the first film, playing Luke as confused, fearful, impetuous, and flawed in a way that makes him more likable, rather than less so. How Hamill never hit it big after his great work here is an injustice on par with Cleavon Little's lack of work after ""Blazing Saddles.""What else about this is great? The score by John Williams, introducing the recognizable ""Imperial March"" theme music as well as some rousing material during the final confrontation between Luke and Darth. The interaction between Vader and his subordinates is chokingly funny, in a way that only adds to the suspense and dread. The opening battle around the ice planet is marvelously intense, especially as witnessed from the cockpits of Rebel fighters taking on thickly-armored Imperial walkers.The returning cast except for Hamill doesn't seem as sharp this time, especially Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia, so charming in ""Star Wars,"" gaunt and miserable here. Much of the whole middle section of the film is draggy and woolly, like the various silly ways the Millennium Falcon escapes Imperial pursuit and the scene in the ""cave"" that goes on much longer than it should. Even Luke's scenes with Yoda become slow and tedious with multiple viewings.The enthusiasm that makes ""Empire Strikes Back"" so beloved today is understandable. It turned ""Star Wars"" from a great film into an enjoyable franchise. But it doesn't really have the same stand-alone quality ""Star Wars"" has, needing both that earlier film and the later ""Return Of The Jedi"" to make it as great as it is.","

The cinematography, the setting, the characters, the story, everything is crisp and succinct in ""Empire"". There were multiple times (3 to be exact) that I had full body chills, all because of the brilliant marriage of story, score and performance.This movie shows that the ""galaxy far, far away"" is more than just Tatooine and the Death Star. From Hoth to Dagpbah to Cloud City, ""Empire"" helps expand the Star Wars Universe. By traveling to different parts of the galaxy, the film physically separates the three leads. Even though apart, their connection remains strong with the force (and their incredible chemistry) binding them together. Their individual journeys have purpose and the addition of new supporting characters (Yoda, Lando, etc.) are legendary.If this film failed, Star Wars would not be the legendary franchise that it is today. Simply put, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is top tier cinema.Additional Note: The three ""chill-worthy"" moments were 1. Yoda raising the ship. 2. THE reveal. 3.

The premise of the film sees Luke Skywalker travel to the planet Dagobah and learn from a Jedi Master in order to improve his skills, while Leia, Han, Chewbacca & C-3PO are on the run from The Empire with Darth Vader in charge of everything.Main Character
There is sometimes some criticism of Mark Hamill's performance in the first two Star Wars films because he does complain and wine quite a bit. However, I think this helps make this character feel interesting to me, the other two jedi's we meet in the first two films in Obi-Wan & Yoda are very wise and all knowing so easy to respect but hard to relate to. Luke is us the audience, we don't understand the teachings of the Jedi and we get frustrated easily, Luke makes mistakes as a character which makes him easier to root for as he feels very human compared to these other characters who feel like gods. This film does a great job in making Luke flawed but also making us care about him and want to see him succeed in his mission despite these flaws.Supporting Characters
As mentioned in my previous review Harrison Ford as Han Solo & Carrie Fish as Leia are brilliant supporting characters and they are great in this film together. They have so much charisma and there chemistry together is off the charts (probably due to real life chemistry), they have some of the most iconic scenes in film history together in this film and there romance really evolves in the film and feels very natural and appropriate for the two characters on screen. Now onto possibly the star of the show the character of Darth Vader, in A New Hope we are given a brief introduction to Vader but in this film he is centre stage and he is the embodiment of pure evil in this film. He is menacing and you are scared of his power as we aren't really shown that in the previous film, he is very commanding and you learn more about his character that makes him even more interesting then he was in the previous film. Frank Oz voices Yoda in the film and he was a great addition to the film, you can really see how wise Yoda is as a character and I really liked his dynamic with Luke in the film as you see two people pretty much at different points of life and how they treat things which leads to them clashing. Billy Dee Williams plays Lando Carrissian, a smuggler that are heroes meet and he also has loads of charisma and charm to him even though you can tell he maybe isn't as honest as he lets on and like Han from the previosu film he has his own motivations to help the team.Story
This film takes risks with its story by splitting the characters up into two different storylines but it really pays off. You have the slower but really interesting personal story with Luke & Yoda and you have the faster more exciting romantic story involving Han & Leia. They both mesh incredibly well and they both give an audience member different things to enjoy and it allows the pacing to feel perfect and well done. Obviously this film has some twists in it that are very well known but I wn't mention them specifically in case there is somebody who doesn't know about it, but it is all handled perfectly and really adds drama to this film but also the future films aswell that was pretty revolutionary at the time and even holds up now even though I know the twists.Script
The script for this film is so well written, the dialogue makes the characters feel so real and the drama is amped up in this one to truly make you care about the characters and the plight that they are in. The humour is good too especially with Han & Leia as it fits there characters perfectly and feels right for them and their romance. Also the twists are perfectly handled and written brilliantly to allow you to really sink them in and understand them.Style
This film's style is darker then A New Hope but it feels right as the heroes are plunged into a darker story and as the title of the film suggests the villains are all over them from very early on. In terms of action scenes The Battle of Hoth at the beginning of the film is one of my favourite battles not just in Star Wars history but in film history. Also the lightsaber battle between Vader & Luke is faster and just as personal as the one between Vader & Obi-Wan making it more exciting and a much better watch. Also John Williams score is even better in this film and really adds to the suspense and the darker story that is being told. I should also mention that I watched the newer Blu Ray version but unlike A New Hope the changes are very small and I actually thought they were fine and didn't change the film one bit.Overall
Overall, I literally struggle to find any faults with this movie. It is the perfect middle part of a trilogy and should be watched as that so watch A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back & Return Of The Jedi in a short time frame to truly appreciate the development of the characters and the story. With this being my favourite film of all time I heavily recommend this film and the other two films in the trilogy.Rating - 10/10.","

","Amthermandes","28 October 2022","This is the epitome of sci-fi movie making. It's a classic, a tale that thrusts the audience into a world completely unlike their own. We love it not just for the famous twist, not just for the cultural impact it has and had on society, but simply for the story and the ground-breaking special effects, one should easily be able to see how much of an achievement this film is.It's a gripping sequel to the story that started it all. It's starts off of a cliffhanger, and ends with an even bigger one, leaving the audience wanting more. I only wish I could travel back in time to see it in theaters when it was first released.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","BenjaminPopkin","30 March 2022","This film is as Star Wars as Star Wars gets in that it is one of if not the best story told in the franchise. Empire Strikes Back takes everything that was good about A New Hope and just completely expands upon it. It is arguably the greatest sequel in cinematic history.Each character is given more emotional depth including Luke, Leia, Han, and even Vader this time. A New Hope is a fun movie, this movie feels more like an emotional experience in comparison. This is the first film in which the Imperial March, one of the best songs created for a movie ever is heard. Also, this movie contains probably the most shocking reveal in all of cinematic history.The sets are more grand, the effects are more spectacular, and the music is absolutely some of the best in all of Star Wars. The film sets genuinely feel completely real. From Hoth to Dagobah to Bespin the locations in this film are so incredibly detailed and well made. Dagobah especially feels like a completely different planet. None of the sets even feel like sets. They feel like real places. Also the special effects are marvelous especially for its time. The asteroid belt scene in particular is not only breathtaking to see but the music mixed in as well makes it so much fun to watch.Which brings me to the action. Much more fun and much more grand in comparison to A New Hope. The opening Hoth battle is such a great scene not only because of the special effects and the captivating action but also because of the stakes. The fact that we are following all the characters and they are all doing something makes it feel like they are actually in trouble and it makes for an engrossing scene. The fight with Luke and Vader is also a great action scene. The scene where Luke is looking for his friends and runs into Vader. The lack of music, the choreography, and all the colors work together to tell the story. One of the best set ups to a fight, like ever. The fight itself is very emotional for both characters which leads up to the big reveal at the end. Luke willingly chose death over joining Vader. It's a cliffhanger, literally.I feel like the Yoda stuff is shorter than it should be. Don't get me wrong I think the training scenes with Yoda on Dagobah are great. But, it feels too short and almost underwhelming. It starts off very funny when we meet Yoda, I love that scene after Luke crashes. I also think the dialogue between Yoda and Luke as well as Yoda and Ben is really well written. Yoda feels like a goofball at first, but quickly begins to come out as a genuine and wise character. All of those scenes are extremely quotable as well like Yoda says some really smart things. In the end it feels like Lukes training is extremely rushed and I understand it's because he chose to leave, but still I would have liked to see more. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate the scenes we did get. The tie fighter scene is awesome and I think about Yoda's quotes to Luke on a daily basis.Overall, The Empire Strikes Back is honestly a masterpiece of cinema. It is one of the best movies ever made without a doubt. The characters all have so much more depth to them. It completely steps it up in comparison to A New Hope. In terms of the character development, special effects, script, and execution. There is never a dull moment, and it is filled with iconic moments. The whole third act is so emotionally powerful. The scene where they lose Han, and then the Vader and Luke scene afterwards. Such well shot, emotional and beautifully filmed scenes. It ends with one of the best cliffhangers ever. Everyone is on a low note, and no one knows what's gonna happen next. The Empire Strikes Back is nothing shy of a masterpiece. *chefs kiss*I like New Hope better because it's much more simple and fun. Revenge of the Sith is my favorite, easily.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","blanbrn","27 May 2007","Episode V ""The Empire Strikes Back"" released in 1980 in my opinion was a great sequel to the 1977 original. As far as quality it closely ranks to the original, and in terms of character development, and plot and as far as the storytelling goes it's probably better than the 1977 original. Directed this time around by Irvin Kershner he does just as good a job with the sets, characters, and special effects work as Lucas did making it just as good as 1977's. Here the saga now has a setting on the ice planet of Hoth, a place that the Rebels have hid from the evil empire in pursuit, with the real goal they have is to reach the fabulous city of Bespin nicknamed Cloud City for it's airy view. Here's when this installment becomes a real coming of age sequel in which the central character Luke Skywalker comes of age both in terms of skill and mind, and that's when he makes a stop in the swamp of Dagobah. It is in the swamps that hold an important part of the saga and the development of the Skywalker character is found here by training with the appearance of the Jedi master Yoda(hey, nice little green puppet!) as Luke's skill of mind and fighting ability is formed making one reason that Episode V is so important. Later a dark secret is revealed, by Darth Vader in the climax at cloud city, and it was just great to see the fierce battle between Luke and Vader to close out this installment. Overall ""The Empire Strikes Back"" might be the best of the saga in terms of the coming of age development of the central character(Luke). Also the plot finally reveals the hidden truth that's a very dark secret, and the introduction of a new and unique character(Yoda) holds the saga together just great. This really is just as good as the 1977 original simply because more key elements are shown and discovered, the only rule of law is I usually don't rank sequels over the original.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","Med-Jasta","14 April 2020","That's what I called this when I was too small to reach the movies in my house. My poor mother had to decipher that description.Just as important as A New Hope was to movies, Empire Strikes Back is to sequels. And why? Because Lucas paid for this himself. No one has ever been in his position before. To make huge movies that are financed by the creator. No studio would ever allow a movie like this, it took risks: It's not a rehash, its darker, a realistic puppet was a serious main character and a lot of the story is left in the air.But while this movie is darker than it's predecessor it's not a dark movie, its just darker. People seem to forget that. It's a more serious story but it's still able to maintain the fun feel of 4. It also continues the speed from 4 as well. Instead of getting in huge fights they are just small scuffles. This doesn't feel for a second that it's trying to outdo the original. The story and the characters are expanded and deepened.Yoda was a huge risk, it's hard for us to think of a puppet not being taken seriously, but no one had ever attempted to make a life like puppet before. And sequels weren't a sure cash in either. In order for this movie to break even it had to be the most successful sequel of all time. It's these things that Lucas gave us. He not only knows how to tell a story and make a great movie but he takes risks to do it at the same time. He did this his whole career. If this movie failed not only was Star Wars dead but so was Lucas' career. That'll motivate you.My favorite SW set is in this, the carbon freezing chamber. I don't know if it's the steam, the orange light or the vastness but I love this room. Everyone looks cool here. Especially the Stormtroopers, their white really illuminates the orange well. And you get Vader and Boba in here too.The snow troopers are very cool. I can't figure out if I like them or the Episode 3 clones best.Lando is a great addition because he's the Han that could have been. And Lando gets crap for being bad but he really does make the best call. He appeases Vader to save his life while still giving himself the freedom to save Han in the end. And he hasn't seen Han in years maybe he's become a real , the last time he saw him he was a smuggler after all. And Billy Dee is great, I don't know if anyone is as effortlessly smooth as this guy.3P0 in pieces is a great addition that provides endless jokes.I love Han's love story with Leah because she's given him no indication that she's interested. And he acts like they have this dating history. But he is right because she does want him.And the best part of the movie: Yoda/training. Not only is Yoda the most powerful Jedi of all but you hang on his every word of wisdom. Lines repeated for my entire life. I have always loved the fact that the most powerful Jedi was the smallest. There's just something about that idea that really gets me.And there's really something to be said for the fact that Yoda is not actually real. We all know that Frank Oz did the voice and puppeteered Yoda but the fact that Yoda is not actually real really helps to make his character real. it's not necessarily Frank Oz as Yoda, what you see is the little green puppet as Yoda. There aren't pictures of him at studio 54 or news of him getting married. Yoda is Yoda. when he is not being the puppet on screen he doesn't exist which really helps to his reality.The biggest complaint since Lucas finished the saga was that ""I am your father,"" is now not a surprise any more. Which is true, you do know, but watching them in order you'll probably be surprised that Anakin turns to the dark side. And it might be a surprise that Vader tells Luke this because as far as we know Vader doesn't know who Luke is. He doesn't even know that he has a kid. And we think that Anakin is dead. I don't know... Only time will tell with people who watch these in episode order","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","IonicBreezeMachine","23 July 2022","Following the events of the last film, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew),Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), their droids R2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and the rest of the rebel alliance have been driven into hiding on the ice planet Hoth after their destruction of the Death Star. Darth Vader(physical: David Prowse, voice: James Earl Jones) continues his search for Skywalker and eventually finds the rebel base with the rebel forces forced to retreat and Luke is separated while Han and the others attempt to elude pursuit of the Empire. Luke travels to the Dagobah system at the direction of his deceased master Obi-Wan (Alec Guinness) and directs Luke to locate his former master Yoda. As Luke dives deeper into the teachings of the Jedi and The Force, Luke's friends will face a danger that will force Luke to make a choice that could lead him to the Dark Side and discover revelations that challenge everything he's learned.George Lucas had always planned to expand Star Wars even if the first film proved unsuccessful down to contracting author Alan Dean Foster who wrote the novelization of Star Wars to write a limited location sequel novel that could be adapted on a low budget released as Splinter of the Mind's Eye. When Star Wars broke Box Office Records, Lucas reappraised his approach to the sequel leaving the Foster adaptation as novel (which became a success in its own right and the start of the Expanded Universe) and proceeding to plan a much more ambitious sequel. Lucas having felt the strain of directing Star Wars opted to take a role as Executive Producer and instead handed the reins to Irvin Kershner. The script received a lot of input from multiple parties as Lucas had many different ideas on how to approach the subject of Luke's father (who was not yet the reveal we know), Luke's sister (also originally a new character), and expanded roles for the Galactic Emperor and other planets which weren't deemed feasible. The script was given multiple passes by several writers including notably Lawrence Kasdan who had impressed Lucas with his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark. Upon initial release some critics were mixed in the darker tone from the original film with some outright lambasting the film, but overtime The Empire Strikes Back has been re-evaluated as not just the best film in the series, but one of the best sequels of all time.From the movie's introduction, it makes it clear to the audience that while the destruction of the Death Star was a victory slowing the threat of the Empire, it didn't stop them as the Rebels are forced to hide on the desolate ice planet of Hoth while Vader searches the galaxy intent on finding Luke. The harshness of the ice world is a fantastic setup with its bitter and inhospitable cold serving as a nice counterpoint to the original desert planet we saw in Star Wars and gives us the feeling of a new and unfamiliar place we've not yet explored. The characters also feel like they've advanced with Luke Skywalker carrying a more hardened demeanor in contrast to the fresh faced youth we were introduced to him as and Han and Leia have both advanced with the two developing a relationship and Han having become less cynical and self-serving as a character. The movie keeps itself mostly pretty simple with Luke embarking on a journey of self-discovery with Jedi master Yoda voiced and puppeted by Frank Oz and the character is a solid mixture of quirky, weird, and wise that makes him a unique mentor figure for Luke to play off against. The action scenes have also been expanded upon with a larger scale and more ambitious effects with the Battle of Hoth sequence featuring some great computer assisted Stop Motion to bring to life walking battle tanks called ""Walkers"" that look amazing in motion as well as destruction. We also get Billy Dee Williams as Han's former friend Lando who plays the role with the same cocky swagger as Han but still gives his own spin on it and gets some good moments in the film as a character. Darth Vader remains a solid antagonist in the film with his menace dialed up as the primary antagonist this time around, but also some solid revelations that are now famous (you know what I'm talking about) and some terrific pitch black humor of Darth Vader ""promoting"" various officers to Admiral after the previous one failed him.The Empire Strikes Back is a great film in its own right and one of the best sequels of all time. The characters you loved the first time around are expanded upon and revisited and the world is made to feel alive and bigger with new environments and world building that make the film an engaging sit even when you know what's coming.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","davidmvining","12 December 2019","There are two main ways to follow up a genre film. The first was perfectly encapsulated by Aliens in the ""bigger is better"" school. You expand the stakes, scale, and number of character to create a bigger, bolder experience. The second is to not go bigger, but to go deeper. The Empire Strikes Back might be the best example of that way to go.The Empire Strikes Back actually feels a good bit smaller in scale than the original Star Wars. The biggest battle happens at the beginning of the film, involving a patch of icy land, several large walking tanks, and about a dozen speeders. That is smaller than the couple of dozen fighters attacking a moon sized base that can destroy a planet. The movie never goes bigger than that. In fact, the scale of the conflict continuously gets smaller as the film goes on.At the beginning, the conflict is between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. It's got galactic consequences, that great battle on the planet of Hoth. If the Rebel Alliance doesn't successfully get away, then the Empire's return strike after the destruction of the Death Star will wipe out its last major adversary for control of the galaxy. The next major set piece is the chase of the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid field. It's now one ship versus a handful of fighters and a Star Destroyer and the uncaring nature of outer space. It's a chase in order to capture the handful of occupants on board so that Darth Vader can lure Luke Skywalker.The final conflict is between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. We're more than an hour since the Rebel Alliance has even been mentioned. The conflict involves only two people, not half a dozen. It's no longer about galactic consequences. Instead it's about a father and son and a conflict of good versus evil. The fight of the film narrows, and the only reason it can pull that off is because of the characters.The original Star Wars utilized archetypes to tell its well-worn story. The Empire Strikes Back moves beyond the familiar hero's journey, and in order to accomplish that it needs to move beyond archetypes. Luke is no longer the farmboy hero. Instead he's an arrogant war hero who thinks far too much of himself. Han is no longer just the rogue, but a man with his own sense of right and wrong. Leia is no longer just the princess in need of help, she can push back on Han and control situations like she could only try to in the first. Darth Vader is no longer just the antagonist, he's now got a more complex goal of turning the hero to his side of the overall conflict. These characters are far more interesting in this second adventure than the first, and the story's structure of the second film is built to allow these characters to actually move through actions and change.The center and highlight really is Luke. As I wrote a second ago, he's wildly arrogant at the start of this film. He goes out to check out a meteorite on his own and escapes from the clutches of a giant snow beast without help from anyone else. He also leads the successful feint against the incoming Empire attack on the Rebel base on Hoth, providing enough time for the transports to get away free and destroying a few of the AT-ATs as well. When he's sent to Dagobah to find Obi-wan's former master, Yoda, he thinks that he's beyond humility. He doesn't need it. He's awesome. But from the moment he lands on Dagobah, he fails at everything he does through the rest of the film. The capstone of his training is when he walks into the cave and fails to use the Force in the ways that Yoda had dictated, fighting the phantom version of Darth Vader and revealing that he had only defeated himself in the fight. He fails to raise his X-wing from the swamp. He fails to maintain control of his emotions when visions of Han and Leia suffering come to him. He fails to listen to Leia's explicit warnings of a trap. He fails in his fight against Darth Vader, only escaping through a desperate act of falling down a giant hole.His constant stream of failures, capped by his failed confrontation with Darth Vader, humbles Luke. He no longer feels like he can face the evils of the universe alone. Dangling from the underbelly of Cloud City with only one hand, he calls out to Leia, desperate for any help. Even in the final moments of the film, he stands with his friends, not apart, and has become part of a plan to help the captured Han instead of running out there alone. Luke's journey in this film is fantastic all the more because it undermines the hero's journey he went through in the first. It goes against the idea of how we think hero's behave and succeed after their great victories.It's the character work that really makes the film work, but the movie continues the first film's proud tradition of great design. There are expansions of the world in things like the Super Star Destroyer and the walking tanks the AT-ATs. Yoda is a creature come alive with puppetry. The fighters, the planets, and creatures are all great. The special effects move the technology of the first film forward, and it's always in the service of the great story and character journeys at the heart of the film.Acting takes another step up as well. Moving directing duties from ""Faster, more intense"" George Lucas to Irvin Kershner was a surprisingly good choice overall, but it makes sense once you realize that The Empire Strike Back is more character film than science fiction adventure.The Empire Strikes Back is a magnificent sequel that takes the characters from the preceding adventure seriously and gives them space to grow, propelling them through an adventure that truly tests them. It very rightly stands atop the world of genre fiction as one of the its greatest accomplishments.","

","masonsaul","17 December 2019","Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is a more mature, unpredictable sequel that continues to expand the universe and is overall even better than the original, as one of the greatest sequels of all time. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Anthony Daniels and Carrie Fisher are all incredible. James Earl Jones is even better as a more threatening and ruthless Darth Vader and Frank Oz is excellent as Yoda. Billy Dee Williams is a welcome addition in a effortlessly charismatic performance. John Williams' musical score is perfect once again. It's expertly paced and Irvin Kershner's direction is incredible. The action sequences are extremely thrilling and it has the best lightsaber fight in the franchise so far, in my opinion.

The fact that George Lucas did this movie on his own with his own money should tell you everything you need to know about how amazingly tenacious he is, not only that, he brought the characters to life..making them memorable, believable and most importantly relatable. Yes it's an old movie, yes it feels out dated...but trust me, if you look really past that and focus on its level of storytelling and the amazing writing of the story, you will understand why this movie has a rating of 8.7...most movies today and even in the last decade haven't even gotten close to that.

","generationofswine","14 November 2017","So, I was almost 1 when this movie dropped and, well, it started the opening night tradition.OK, well, how to do this? I guess we will start with the hate. I like to address the hate in movies, especially ones that are well regarded and loved.Now, I'll excuse it for the people that just don't like Star Wars. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.But then there are the people that really hate Empire because of...reasons. And those reasons are Revenge of the Sith.I'm sorry, panning Empire because of loyalty to the prequels--misplaced as it is--doesn't make I-III any better. It just makes you petty.Now, why its loved and, I'll admit, I am one of those fanboys that really do love this movie.For starters, Empire went dark. It was the really the episode that the good guys lost and, that made it unique among, well, among just about every movie not made in the 1970s. I guess that is what made the 70s such a wonderful time for movies.We could use a little more of that. We could use a lot more of that. We use a lot more gritty in cinema. And, we could use a lot more ""lived in"" Everything looks too clean.Empire had that.And then it had that big, legendary, reveal that made all those kisses between Luke and Leia utterly wrong once the second big reveal hit in 1983...which explained that look Han gave Leia when she told him in the next installment.Moving on...We have the Battle of Hoth, which, yeah, nerd awesomeness with kind of a WWI trench warfare v tanks feel and a WWII Evacuation of Dunkirk feel with the rebels on the run and the Empire forcing its way across the galaxy with brute strength.And that prolonged time on the Falcon, well, that was just brilliant for character development and, incest blocking.So, really, honestly, there was way too much to love not to put Empire on the throne.","

Only with the Jedi master's help will Luke survive when the dark side of the Force beckons him into the ultimate duel with Darth Vader (David Prowse).This has to be my favourite Star Wars movie out of them all! This movie does everything way better than the first with great character Development will all characters and the introduction of 2 new characters, a smuggler from Hans past and a badass bounty hunter. The most has great special effects and a great musical score by John Williams again! The sets are so good to look at and the characters are so much more likeable in this movie!The movie also becomes way more darker than the last one.Mark Hamill does a way better job playing Luke even becoming more likeable. Carrie Fisher is still the likeable princess from the first one. Harrison Ford is still as likeable from the first one and him and Leia relationship is way more drawn out. Chewbacca is hilarious in this movie. Billy Dee Williams is a welcomed addition to this movie! James Earl Jones is menacing Vader!Overall this is the best Star Wars movie to date!","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","tedg","15 February 2007","The SonI am convinced that movies are about other movies more than life. The original ""Star Wars"" was a success in my opinion because it had three things:  a collection of images from other films, distinctly referencing them. Some were film- schoolish like the Kurosawa quotes. But most were like what Kurosawa himself referenced: already deeply embedded visual touchstones, not having lost their power in becoming clichés. These were collected in one large form, the Flash Gordan form let's call it, which all of us slightly knew. It could be recalled with enough familiarity to register but not enough to set expectations, so Lucas could fill the bucket with whatever he found and liked. a notion of a complete, understandable cosmology. Its the noir notion that laws of the universe exist and cannot be seen, and if they could they wouldn't be comprehensible. This notion is deep in film, so deep that when a movie comes along that posits a cosmology that is whole, and revealable, it shocks. What that movie did was give us enough of a glimpse into this to believe that we could understand the world, at least THIS world of the ""galaxy far away."" Remember when that original came out? The images were impressible, but what people talked about wasn't what they saw, but about how the world worked. It settled first in an ersatz religion among geeky kids and now has been swallowed by the ""simple"" US religions, and its presidential representative. the notion of a quest. Its an old form, but cast in the above noted situation, it takes new power. The traditional form, the Goethe-Lytton form was there to remind and reveal mysteries. Here it is clearer, to explain. There was a lowbrow professor at the time of a women's college that a TeeVee interviewer made popular. It was sort of a metaquest. This simple man said that we could actually understand the nature of trying to understand nature. It was a lucky break for Lucas, because it meshed with this shocking notion of a grand cosmology that we know our hero (check out the name: ""sky walker"") will grasp, master and show us.That was the first film. A huge success, just huge. It did change many things, but from my perspective the key thing was how it reset that great American invention of noir, as important as jazz, and liberty which form a sort of trilogy of contradictory, three-way tension.Okay. Now the second big Ted idea, the necessity for the equal size of steps in abstraction when you have two steps. It seems this is hardwired in the brain, a sort of human quantum mechanics. If you look back along the abstraction, say a cartoon in a cartoon, the distance between the two will be precisely the same as the surrounding cartoon.So, when they made the second Star Wars movie, they could reference the previous one in the way that it referenced its cinematic background. It had a writer in Kasden who knew how to do this. And it had a director in Lucas' film school teacher who did also. Neither had a huge hit other than this because it was such a cool setup, having such a thing to build on.You'll read lots about trying to humanize, and how faces were used. But all that is simply in the service of abstracting closer to us from the original, in equal portion. This is the son. Why did the franchise fail after this? Because there was no step left to abstract to and maintain the brand.(This comment is a replacement of one deleted for unknown reasons. This was requested by a reader.)Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","ccthemovieman-1","10 June 2006","Although called ""Episode V,"" this was second movie in the Star Wars 6-part installment and I've always thought one of the better entries in the series.If you watch the first Star Wars and then this one, you'll immediately see a vast improvement in the special-effects department. There is a much more polished look to this one, and improved sound In fact, the DVD transfer is outstanding considering the age of this film.While the first Star Wars was a bit subdued, this one picks up the action right from the start, although lulls are really appreciated because the first 40 minutes are pretty hectic. The most notable of those scenes are the gigantic robots which were awesome when this film first came out, and are still pretty good. The movie calms down after that opening land war but retains the viewer's interest with other things.The second half of the movie features two stories going on at once: the battle in space with most of the cast involved, and ""Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in a swampland involved in his training sessions with the Master Yoda.Some of the movie's dialog is still corny, especially between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) with their love-hate relationship, but it's not overdone. What is overdone is constant bleating noises emanating from ""Chewbacca,"" the wookie. That sheep-in-heat noise can get annoying after awhile. The ""Rambo"" action continues as it did in the first film, with the villains firing everything at our heroes and never hitting them. Ludicrous, but part of the deal. Those things you just put up with as the film, overall, delivers another interesting adventure, far more than the first Star Wars and leading up to the next one, which was even better.","

","Z21708","23 December 2018","There's only two Star Wars films that I actually really love: A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. That's not to say that I like some of the other films in the franchise, but the two I just listed are my alltime favorites.The Empire Strikes Back is a very in-depth film. While it's predecessor was simply just a lot of fun, this film is something special.Luke is an extremely flawed character. He rushes into things eithout thinking things through, he is very whiny, etc. But all at once, that's what makes him such a great character. Characters are supposed to be flawed, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't get development to make them less flawed. People complained about Luke being s whiny character, but that's part of the development process. Characters start off bratty and childish, but eventually get better with each film.The story of this film is amazing. From the pacing and dark tone to the characters and writing, this film has a lot going for it. The first film also had a good story, but the characters didn't have as much development. Not to mention that unlike A New Hope, Empire has a much darker tone to it. After the Rebels lose the Battle of Hoth, there's really this feeling of uncertainty as to what will happen to our heroes next. And Darth Vader is, in my opinion, one of the most iconic and badass villains in movie history. And the scene where Luke rushes to Cloud City before he could complete his training to help his friends after they're captured by the Empire really shows just how flawed of a character he is.Empire is a special movie. It, along with the rest of the Original Trilogy, changed cinema forever. This movie was made with legitimate care and love for the first film.Its a great film, and if you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend you check it out.","

","ronakkotian","10 December 2019","I remember watching The Empire Strikes Back when I was young and just completely loving it. Even today it remains as my favourite film in the franchise.Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back follows Luke Skywalker training more and more to become a Jedi whilst Han Solo and Princess Leia are pursued by Darth Vader.After A New Hope, everyone was so excited to see the next Star Wars film. It became one of the most anticipated films of the early 80s and once it finally came out, people just fell in love with it. This is the best Star Wars film to date and here's why.First of all the camerawork in this movie is absolutely excellent. RIP Irvin Kershner, you did a great job. The special effects definitely evolved since Episode IV as they look really good. It's astounding to think that this movie came out in 1980 because how beautiful the set design and effects were. Whilst A New Hope didn't have many fight sequences, this one has plenty and the action scenes are extremely entertaining to watch that keep the adrenaline flowing.Apart from all the positives mentioned, the area where this film shines is its characters. The acting by everyone was superb once again. Writers Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan wrote a beautiful script as we learn more about each of our beloved characters. The chemistry between Leia and Solo is fantastic and quite funny at times. We learn a lot about Luke's past and his relation to Vader which makes up for a great conflict between the two. If you thought Darth Vader was evil in the previous film, wait till you see how menacing he becomes in The Empire Strikes Back. This film also gave us YODA which was an absolute treat.The Empire Strikes Back is my favourite Star Wars film and I don't think any other film can reach its level. The film is well paced alongside some incredible action sequences that keep the intensity going. Our heroes are given a lot of depth which makes us root for them and care about them throughout and the villains have never been so menacing. The Empire Strikes Back is a classic and will remain a classic for a very long time.","

","acedj","1 November 2019","Like the Wrath of Khan, Empire improves upon the first movie in the series. In fact, once all three were out, this remained the best of them. Often times the second movie of a trilogy feels more like a step that was needed to reach the conclusion rather than an adventure of its own. Empire succeeded where so many others failed, even in the modern trilogies. The characters are further developed, the special effects are ground breaking and the universe in which this is based is rich.","

","nobbytatoes","11 November 2005","The rebels have had their brief victory over the Imperial Forces; destroying the Death Star. But the rebels are on the run, hiding on the remote planet Hoth. Though hidden for now, it doesn't last long. The Empire have found the rebels base and are going to wipe them out. When the rebels escape, Luke goes to find Yoda, to begin his training to become a Jedi. Han, Chewbacca, Leia and C3PO are having more trouble. They are being run down by the Imperial Force fleet; trouble is the Millennium Falcon is falling apart, making their escape all the harder. Finally escaping they head to the cloud city to take refuge with Han's old friend, Lando. But Lando is stuck in a bind. He is being used as a pawn by Darth Vader, to set a trap for Luke.This can easily be said to be one of only a few sequels that has surpassed the original. The Empire Strikes Back is darker, deeper plotting, much better dialog and incorporates more action without relying upon it. T.E.S.B. expand the story even further, creating some startling revelations. I still remember the first time i heard Vader's mind boggling truth to Luke. This also perfectly sets up for the third sequel, ending on such a note of anticipation.The acting is also better. Here all the actor have fitted comfortably into their characters. As the dialog is better, they seem a lot more comfortable; Lucas's writing in the first Star Wars at times seemed really basic and childish, but its more intellectual here.The special effects are just great. They make the action sequences so much better. The fight between the rebels and the Imperial Walkers is so amazing. The fight between Luke and Vader is so intense and emotionally charged; it stays with you that fight.A step forward in the Star Wars movies. One of the best sequels to any movie.","

The lines quoted by Yoda throughout his sequenes are some of the best known movie quotes of all time as well. John Williams continues to deliver with his score and character themes too.

","ethanwissmann","28 May 2022","The Empire Strikes Back brings the viewer further into the galaxy of Star Wars. Following the events of Episode IV: A New Hope, this darker chapter brings newer characters and adventures to the table. We learn more about who we have already come to love in the previous installment and we are able to enjoy a much more well-rounded and fleshed out idea of what Lucas' galaxy far far away should look and feel like. Harrison Ford's portrayal of Han Solo steals the show alongside his companion Chewbacca, played by the late Peter Mayhew. Mark Hamill really ups his game with Luke, making him into a less adolescent and sheltered farm kid, he's learning more about his past and the life he never knew. Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa is the perfect mixture of sass and whit as she shows us that not all space royalty is uppity and useless. Billy Dee Williams knocks it out of the park with his performance as the suave and charismatic Lando Calrissian. With the success of A New Hope, this movie boasts and impressive budget increase. This is shown in the care and detail taken into consideration when seeing all of the creatures and vehicles shown throughout the film. Simply put, this movie CARES. The people involved put forth their best work to bring what the world needed in a constant rotation of mundane and bad sci-fi action flicks coming out around the same time. The Empire Strikes Back is a perfect Star Wars movie in an otherwise very flawed saga. I recommend it for anyone that wants to go on a wild and fun ride through the stars!","

Without any doubt, those three first movies of the ST franchise are still and maybe for all eternity gems and milestones to the sci-fi genre, but almost everything else that was produced and published after Return of the Jedi is in comparison bad, really bad, with a very few exceptions (Rogue One was good). But maybe the saying even a blind hen sometimes finds a grain of corn just fits too well to Mr. Lucas. Anyway, he gave us these three epic movies, and for these treasures I am grateful in all eternity, and the rest I can just ignore. Amen.","

","filipemanuelneto","29 May 2016","This film is the continuation of the story of the first. The war between the rebels and the Empire continues, while Darth Vader Luke demand throughout the galaxy. Directed by Irvin Kershner and written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan, this film has the participation of the same actors from the first film.The film inherits most of the qualities of his predecessor. It has a carefully chosen cast and consistent performances, with some emphasis on the work of Harrison Ford, actor who was already highlighted in the first film and now consolidates his success. Action scenes are excellent, thought of meticulous way and the fight scenes with lightsaber remind us some great duels of piracy and swashbuckling films. The special visual and sound effects are the best that existed at the time and fulfill their role with great merit. The only difference between this film and the latest films of the saga is, in fact, this technical issue, given the huge advance that, in a few decades, the techniques and special effects achieved. The soundtrack was again in charge of John Williams, which continues the excellent work started in the first film of the saga. In fact, the first main theme of the chords of the saga became one of the songs that instinctively comes to mind of people when they think of film music, the same way as the ""March of Darth Vader"" has become one of most songs instinctively associated with the image of any movie villain. The point of greatest merit of this movie is the script. It is a deeper script, more psychological and intense than the script of the first film, and this contributed decisively to the success of it, and the franchise itself. Oscar winner for Best Sound, is one of the most popular films of the saga in the present day.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","hall895","27 May 2005","One of the rare sequels which manages to surpass the original, The Empire Strikes Back is an all-time classic. A much more personal tale, this film is really all about the journey of young Luke Skywalker. A New Hope followed Skywalker as he became involved in the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Here the rebellion is put on the back burner. This is less the story of a grand rebellion and more the story of one young man's growth as he continues to fulfill his destiny.We pick up with the rebels in hiding on a secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth. All the familiar figures from last time around are here, including Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. And Luke Skywalker is here as well and it is Skywalker whom Darth Vader seems most interested in finding. Last time out Vader and the Empire were simply interested in wiping out the mostly anonymous rebels. Now, Vader has taken a personal interest in young Skywalker. The movie kicks into high gear as the Empire locates the rebel base and a great battle ensues. The rebels are forced to flee their base and here our heroes go off in different directions.Guided by the spirit of former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness in what is basically a cameo role) Luke Skywalker heads for the distant swampy planet of Dagobah where he is to be trained by the old Jedi master Yoda. Soon to be one of the most beloved characters in the series, Yoda is a 900-year old, two feet tall, green alien creature. The performances of puppeteer Frank Oz as Yoda and Mark Hamill as Skywalker are crucial here. Were the performances lacking audiences might have found it hard to believe these scenes where the young Jedi trainee converses and interacts with the rather odd little creature. But Hamill and Oz pull it off well. On Dagobah Luke (and the audience) learn much about the Force and the ways of the Jedi. In the original film the only Jedi we saw, Obi-Wan Kenobi was a rather mysterious figure. Now some light is shed on exactly who the Jedi are and what is required to become one.While Luke trains on Dagobah, Han Solo and Princess Leia are sidetracked on their journey to meet up with the rest of the rebels. Harrison Ford is terrific again playing Solo as he has the ultra-confident wiseguy role down pat. Carrie Fisher is again strong in the role of Leia, who drops some of the pretense of the last film and begins to give in to her rather obvious feelings for the swashbuckling Solo. Eventually Han and Leia make their way to Cloud City where we are introduced to another new character in the saga, Han's old friend Lando Calrissian. Han and Leia don't quite trust Lando and it soon becomes apparent that things in Cloud City are not quite what they seem. Sensing his friends are in danger Luke Skywalker leaves Dagobah to attempt to rescue them.Skywalker arrives in Cloud City to meet his destiny. Han, Leia and the rest of the characters fade into the background as the climax, much as the entire film, will be all about Luke Skywalker. Where the original Star Wars ended with an epic space battle, here everything leads up to a thrilling one-on-one showdown capped by one of the most jaw-dropping revelations ever seen in film.Some will say the ending of The Empire Strikes Back leaves the audience hanging. It is true there is not a clearly defined traditional ending as in the original film. But the ending here is powerful in its own way. It leaves you in great suspense, eagerly awaiting the inevitable conclusion to the saga. The film is not truly self-contained, it requires the knowledge of what has come before and the expectation of what will come after. It is by not going for the easy Hollywood ending that The Empire Strikes Back truly triumphs.Taken on its own merits The Empire Strikes Back can be said to even surpass the original Star Wars. The acting performances are again first-rate. Yoda is a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable new character. In playing Lando Calrissian, Billy Dee Williams gives us someone well worth rooting for. Or against, we're not quite sure. The John Williams score, including the famed spine-chilling Imperial March, is magnificent. The visuals are dazzling, as would be expected. And most importantly we have a truly great story. The Empire Strikes Back, much more so than A New Hope, is Luke Skywalker's movie. It is fascinating to watch his journey as he moves towards fulfilling his ultimate destiny.","

","Michael_Elliott","19 December 2015","The Empire Strikes Back (1980) **** (out of 4)The second film of the original trilogy has the Empire forcing their vengeance as Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) begins his Jedi training with Yoda while Hans Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca and the gang try to get to Darth Vadar.George Lucas directed the original STAR WARS in 1977, which was a tremendous hit with both fans and critics. He basically took a ""B"" movie idea, something you'd see at a Saturday matinée and made it into a high-quality picture. This sequel had Lucas turning the directing duties over to Irvin Kershner and the end result certainly raises it to an ""A"" movie and one that many fans believe is the greatest of the series. I'm not going to lie, I somewhat enjoy the original a tad bit more but that's not to say this is a bad movie. Far from that.What's rather amazing is the fact that the producers, director and screenwriters simply could have given us the same film again but instead they decided to make it much bigger, more darker and I'd argue they really wanted to blow the original out of the water. The film once again benefits from some terrific special effects, a rousing score from John Williams and there's no question that visually the film is a lot more impressive than the original.You've also got the cast back together with both Hamill and Fisher once again delivering the goods but also Billy Dee Williams and Alec Guinness in a bit part. Once again it's Harrison Ford who easily steals the film with his comic timing and just that hero persona that shines through. Plus, it's just magic seeing him and Chewbacca work together.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is considered one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made and it's hard to argue with that.","

","classicsoncall","8 June 2007","The summary line is one of my favorite movie quotes of all time because it embodies a philosophy and a discipline. Whenever I hear someone say 'I'll try', I already know it's a cop out with no intention of getting involved with the task in question. Had George Lucas 'tried' to make the movie, it would never have gotten done. I guess that's why Yoda is my favorite Star Wars character. Yeah OK, he's a puppet, but the character of Yoda is like the Spock of the SW universe, a stabilizing force (Force?) who helps Luke remain grounded and in control of his emotions.I recall some disappointment the first time I saw this film during it's original theatrical release relative to the Han Solo cliffhanger, somehow I felt it took away from the structure I was looking for in the chapter following the original ""Star Wars"". Viewing it today I don't feel the same way. It dealt a momentary reprieve to the Han/Leia romance and allowed for analysis of the Darth/Luke relationship. Vader's attempt to shield his son from the Emperor by promising a turn to the Dark Side was ingeniously turned on it's head with Vader suggesting young Skywalker use his power to defeat the Emperor. The scene was cleverly done and Luke's response hinted at things to come in ""Return Of The Jedi"".My most recent viewing of this episode was only the third time since the original theatrical release, and I find that it hasn't lost any of it's impact, maintaining a vitality and excitement that time hasn't diminished. Watching the remastered DVD version, particularly with the sub titles, offers an entirely new perspective when you can pause and rewind to understand better what certain characters said. Perhaps that's why I found it a lot easier to keep track of the fine points of the story, place names like Hoth, Yavin and Bespin, and secondary characters like Governor Tarkin. All those subtle points add a more defined structure to the story, and helps one appreciate much more the intricacy of the universe created by George Lucas.","

","PCC0921","13 June 2022","Before the release of Star Wars (1977], in the theaters, it still had to go through the same steps as any other movie. It too was considered a one shot deal, just like any other movie. It too, like every other film, had to pass the big test at the box office first, before anything else could happen. As everyone knows, this George Lucas directed film, was a huge box office smash, becoming the highest grossing movie of all time. It still held the record in 1980, thus giving the green-light for Lucas to develop a trilogy of films. What makes Empire Strikes Back (1980), so good, is the fact that, the film is one of those bridge-films. It bridges the gap from the first film to the third film. Some number two films in a trilogy, are susceptible to taxing pacing, caused by the need to be a set-up for the big finale in the third film. If done correctly, the film can be a successful bridge-film, while still completing its goal of being an exciting entry in the trilogy. This film accomplishes the goal of being an exciting adventure, full of maturing characters and it comes with a more darker side to it. It also successfully bridges the gap to the third film, Return of the Jedi (1983). It creates major implications for the main cast of characters. It is a cliff-hanger of a story.George Lucas stepped aside as the director for this film, for director Irvin Kershner. Kershner creates a slick, exciting, action-packed adventure, full of dazzle, flare and artistry. It has one of the most incredible soundtracks ever, thanks to legendary composer John Williams. It is pure pleasure watching this film. It is the stuff of legends now. It is still hailed as being the best Star Wars movie ever. The film starts with the main cast together, but splits them up into two stories, that carries the film to the end, eventually bringing them together again, but with a price. The first sub-plot involves Luke (Mark Hamill), meeting the Muppet-like, Jedi master, Yoda (Frank Oz), who begins training Luke to be a Jedi. The other sub-plot involves Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), being chased by Darth Vader (Peter Mayhew/James Earl Jones) and enlisting the aid of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), the leader of Cloud City. The stage is set for one of the biggest cliff-hangers in film history.9.3 (A Mygrade) = 9 IMDB.","

Again as I said in my review for a New Hope, film criticism from me is practically irrelevant since I love the original 3 movies. The Empire Strikes Back is still one of the most shocking film experiences of my life, mainly in how it ended, in which the good guys lost, Darth Vader was Luke's father and it ended on such a somber note. It also led to extreme debate as to where they would go from here and many kids at the lunch table wondered how this twist came to be. I still stand by A New Hope being my personal favorite, but this is a better overall film, the snow walkers in particular are still breathtaking and Cloud City while not as spectacular in 1980, still holds up really well.

","deepfrieddodo","24 April 2023","Arguably the best film from the original trilogy (and entire Star Wars saga), The Empire Strikes Back strikes a more mature tone than it's predecessor; still fantastical and exploring a labyrinth of imagination that you could get lost in, but delving deeper into the mysticism of the force and division between good and evil.Some of the most famous quotes and scenes in cinema history are found within these two hours, influential and replicated or parodied countless times. It's difficult to find someone not aware of the film's 'twist', even if they haven't seen the film, and that cultural impact shows what a behemoth this film is. The storytelling takes an almighty step forward with these plot points, keeping the story engrossing and well paced.Empire sees the introduction of some of the most recognisable characters in media; fan favourites who's mannerisms and qualities endure beyond the film. Without losing any of the core characters from A New Hope, these new characters are integrated well, having meaningful contributions to the story and wider context, without overwhelming screentime.Relationships develop tenfold, creating more chemistry between all the characters, new and old. Whilst more apparent arcs of friendship, romance, and betrayal flourish, smaller interactions between less noticeable relationships show the evolution off screen - such as Chewbacca and C3PO. Leia in particular is given the opportunity to stamp her personality in the film, even more so than previously - an excellent character leading the way instead of falling into the royal category of damsel in distress.Once again, the settings as magnificent, none more so than the original locations in the likes of Hoth and Dagobah. Cloud CIty benefits from Lucas' later edits, but these built sets create such an atmosphere. These are supported by the costuming, props and puppetry, which are as iconic as the heroes utilising them.The soundtrack is still excellent and transitions the story between scenes so well. Overall, the whole film is a little more seamless, and it is the perfect film building upon an unbeatable foundation.","

","neil-476","14 February 2011","I never really cared for the sequences with the Falcon parked on the asteroid (and all the faffing about with the faulty hyperspace drive stopped being funny fairly early on), nor with much of the Dagobah stuff.In fact, although I love all of the Star Wars films, this is probably my least favourite of the original trilogy. But I like the fact that it starts with the established characters even more established - the relationships from the first movie are now solidly in place (although Han and Luke jockeying for position over Leia becomes slightly uneasy in view of what is now the pre-knowledge that they are siblings).The Hoth sequence is great (and it has my late friend Michael in it), and the carbonite chamber and fight between Luke and Vader are fabulous, notwithstanding the bunny teeth which Luke develops when Darth Vader delivers the message which, of course, will no longer be such a knockout punch to audiences who have seen episodes 1 to 4 before this one.","

","cosmorados","26 January 2008","And I've seen some great films. However, within this one it's the culmination of both fortuitous events and the craft and skill of everyone involved that makes this the best film of all time.If you start with the script, because many people leave this detail out, you realise how well crafted the dialogue is. This is no accident and arguably the key to this success was the work by Leigh Brackett, the woman that was also partly responsible for the script to the Bogey classic ""The Big Sleep"". I've often said that it you place Han and Leia's script in empire and compare the sparkling repartee between them and Marlow and Rutledge you could almost switch them between films (Those are harsh words to throw at a man, especially when he's walking out of your bedroom and sorry sweetheart, I haven't time for anything else, in particular).Then of course the luck factor kicks in. Bad luck at first with Mark Hamill's terrible bike accident which had to be explained with the wampa attack, which in turn leads to the scene where we see how Luke's powers are first coming along. Then arguably the best piece of lateral thinking. The obvious jedi master would be 6 feet tall and virtually indestructible, and rather than do that, they make Yoda anything but, they went the other way and created one of cinema's best realised fake characters. In Empire, Yoda is masterfully done and every scene with him is like a moment with a treasured Grandparent whose wisdom is strange but unquestionable. This is Yoda's film and is fantastic for it.The John williams score in this one is breathtaking, key moments, include the lifting of the X-wing and the confrontation between Lando and vader, so subtle, but so perfect.Finally the effects, the light sabre duel is arguably the best one ever put on film, as Luke's quick but not perfect yet, going up against a Jedi Warrior whose powers are second to only 2 others in the galaxy. Awesome, and as for the revelation, I thought he was lying when I was 10 years old, it is almost too unbelievable, but believable it is.First three aren't a patch and this one is George's masterpiece.10/10 Mikey B","

","WalterFrith","23 January 2005","George Lucas' 'Star Wars' trilogy is the greatest fantasy story in all of film history. Yes, even better than the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. 'Lord of the Rings' is fine work but the characters aren't as well developed as in 'Star Wars' and they are too long. Also, each 'Star Wars' film stands out better than each 'Lord of the Rings' film. Three chapters in 'Lord of the Rings' is one big movie while 'Star Wars' is a space western, 'The Empire Strikes Back' is a dark, attractive and Gothic work of art and 'Return of the Jedi' is like a Disney film. Each has their own personality. As far as trilogies go altogether, 'The Godfather' films will always be the greatest in movie history'.I love 'The Empire Strikes Back' but I can't go along with the assertion that it is better than 'Star Wars'. I was one of those people that saw 'Star Wars' every weekend for a year when I was 11 and 12 years when a child's admission was only 50 cents to a dollar. There was such a magnificent freshness to 'Star Wars' that audiences couldn't get enough and when adjusted for inflation, 'Star Wars' is the second biggest box office film is history, second only to 1939's 'Gone with the Wind'. Meaning that these two films sold the most tickets in motion picture history.'Star Wars' even created the entire concept of the modern day blockbuster and influenced hundreds of films after it, is the biggest movie in the history of popular culture and created a new religion. A recent poll in Britain asked people to identify their religion and a substantial portion of them wrote in ""Jedi Knight"".'The Empire Strikes Back' does advance the story line forward greatly, has a convincing and blossoming love story between Han Solo and Pricess Leia and gives us the showdown we want. It also introduces us to the legendary Yoda and a new key player in Lando Calrissian and has some breath taking special effects. But 'The Empire Strikes Back' owes its success to 'Star Wars' but has to be given credit for the fact that it teaches people, especially the young, that the good guys don't always win and that the fight for what's right sometimes seems impossible.","

","Robert_duder","16 February 2009","After the success of Star Wars I think I might have expected a slip if they took it to a sequel but apparently George Lucas' love for this world trumped film making curses for bad sequels. The Empire Strikes Back brings back the incredible original heroes, gives them even more depth and story and still finds time to bring in new timeless characters that become legends in their own right. Even with a new director at the helm, Irvin Kershner, the story and the world that made the first Star Wars so incredible is in tact and even better. The only problem really with the first Star Wars is it felt like only the beginning. Like there were layers of detail that we didn't get and The Empire Strikes Back burst into those layers and put us deep into the world and the story never to turn back. On top of that the film delivers the first and most infamous twist in film history...family connections so to speak. I won't give it away if you have existed under a rock for the last three decades. The fights are epic, the new characters are amazing, and even Hamill as Skywalker starts to really shine and get some real depth to his character.I already reviewed the cast of the original film but their characters really do change a lot for the better in the sequel. Mark Hamill's performance matures and really comes full circle just like his character in the film. His naivety and boyish charm changes for the better as he trains to become a Jedi and an adult. Harrison Ford's Han Solo is probably the character that changes the least and probably just a case of ""don't mess with a good thing."" Solo is still a kick butt hero and his story is a focal point of the sequel. Carrie Fisher slips back into her role as the feisty Princess flawlessly. This time the banter and romantic tension between Fisher and Ford heats up and really gives the story a timeless romance. Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Peter Mayhew return in full form as C3P0, R2D2 and Chewbacca and they are better than ever. David Prowse with James Earl Jones providing the voice continues to make Darth Vader the most evil, intensely bad villain in the history of films. Vader's character really turns up the heat and gives a terrifying turn as the leader of the Empire. Billy Dee Williams is a newcomer to the cast and a welcome addition. He plays gambler, scoundrel Lando Calrissian. He doesn't get a lot of background or depth to his character and yet he is a great addition to the cast. And saving the best for last...the master of the Star Wars Universe. Frank Oz brings Master Yoda to life. The entire sequence with Luke and Yoda meeting for the first time and training is brilliant. Yoda is a timeless character, a pop culture phenomenon and yet his part in this is touching, funny, and brilliant. Pretty good for a puppet.The Empire Strikes Back is just simply non stop. The film picks up where the first left off and takes the viewer on a thrill ride that just never stops. This is ultimately all about the evil Empire and Vader getting his revenge and essentially succeeding. Starting from the opening moment of the film on the brilliantly crafted ice world of Hoth, and continuing on to a show down between Skywalker and Vader himself and the revealing of the infamous secret this film is just brilliant. The direction, the creation, the writing, the characters and the special effects are jaw droppingly amazing. There is simply no way you can watch just one Star Wars movie because the story is so important but after watching the first one and thinking...wow this is pretty incredible, The Empire Strikes Back will floor you!! One of the greatest sequels of all time. 10/10","

The plot twist is perfect and has gone down in cinema history. This film was not directed by George Lucas, which makes it much better.

","DanB-4","14 April 2006","It took many years and many viewings before I could say that I liked this film better than A New Hope. But careful examination tells all - by every conceivable measure this is a better picture. The characters are more fully developed, Vader is even more evil, the score gives us the chilling Vader theme and the story is more interesting. Now that the six films are complete, The Empire Strikes Back is even more compelling and interesting than it was before we knew its Big Secret.All great heroes are flawed, and Luke Skywalker is no exception. Empire reveals to us in full that the inner battle he will have to fight is worse than any enemy he will face. As we meet for the first time Yoda, the wise Jedi master (we find out in Sith why he is on this jungle planet), we learn what a Jedi is, what his responsibility is and just how difficult that life will be. Luke, however, wants immediate gratification - he wants to help and wants revenge.The film cuts back and forth between Han Solo and Leia's pursuit by Vader and Luke's training and ultimately leads to the greatest scene of the six films, the epic light saber battle between Luke and Vader. And, if you are one of the 12 people on the planet who do not know the outcome, the less said the better.Empire rightly holds a place in the IMDb top 10, combining Action-Adventure, space opera and even the best elements of a super-hero film, into an infinitely watchable, entertaining movie. **** out of ****.","

","drqshadow-reviews","5 December 2012","Top of the line for a majority of Star Wars geeks, and for good reason. It's the ideal melting pot of George Lucas's vast, quirky imagination, his influences' knack for dark, large-scale epics, and his key contributors' determined efforts to retain a central humanism amidst all the creatures, effects and operatic indulgences. A wildly ambitious picture, it's genuinely amazing just how much territory is covered over the course of two hours. Lucas and company manage to leap from the Hoth battle to Yoda on Dagobah, the asteroid field to Lando and Cloud City, before finally climaxing with the classic Luke / Vader showdown and revelation. That's an awful lot of set pieces, not to mention some seriously powerful plot points, but smooth talking and a few outstanding performances keep the film from feeling over-stuffed or under-explored. The cast, too, grows on an individual basis almost universally, with Luke wrapping himself in the wisdom of the Jedi, Han and Leia developing genuine chemistry and Darth Vader, in a surprise twist that should never have been so effective, actually showing some signs of humanity. Although it can be hammy from time to time, those moments are balanced expertly by a wonderful series of mountains and valleys, to the point that they stop being seen as negatives and instead contribute to the picture's eccentricity. A legendary effort that's just as monumental, entrancing and electric thirty years later, it's damn near perfect.","

","MissSimonetta","7 August 2014","Why is The Empire Strikes Back (1980) such a beloved movie? Star Wars (1977) is more fun, but Empire marks the point where the story gained more emotional depth and the matinée serial black-and-white morality of the original becomes less defined.Howard Hawks once said a great movie has a few great scenes and no bad ones. If that is the case, then Empire is without doubt a great film, as one cannot find a bad scene in the bunch. As for great scenes, just take your pick: the battle on Hoth, Luke's training in Dagobah, the X-wing rising from the swampy muck, Lando's reluctant betrayal, Han and Leia's poignant farewell in the carbon chamber.Undoubtedly, the most iconic moment in this film is the climactic confrontation between Luke and Darth Vader, when our hero discovers his much-idealized father is a fallen Jedi who has lost much of his conscience and humanity. Though Luke's reaction to this reveal is often mocked and even I cannot help but chuckle sometimes, I think it's entirely appropriate. Hamill's big ""noooo"" is not forced or phony; the way his face contorts and his voice cracks makes it feel raw and heartbreaking.This is one of few films that gets better every time you watch it. It also makes me keenly aware how the series declined in quality afterward (Return of the Jedi is okay, but it feels a bit too derivative of the first and a bit too juvenile for an epic conclusion). Out of all the SW films, this one is the closest to perfection.","

","ryan_kuhn","14 February 2005","Generally regarded as the best of the 5 Star Wars movies(so far, the sixth and final one comes out in May 2005), The Empire Strikes Back is everything Star Wars wasn't. Back in 1977, George Lucas brought us the first story from a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away, Star Wars (Now known as ""A New Hope""), and it was a bright, cheerful Saturday afternoon serial with some great special effects. Three years later, George Lucas' story about Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo took a decidedly darker tone in The Empire Strikes Back. None of the good guys win in this second chapter of the 3 film saga that makes up the Original Star Wars Trilogy, the film acts as a dark bridge from the light, fun action of A New Hope to the concluding Return of the Jedi. Even the last scene of this film reeks of ""To Be Continued,"" without actually saying it. The rebel forces, after blowing up the Death Star, are forced to hide out on a the ice planet Hoth. Darth Vader tracks them down, and our heroes are forced to flee. Han and Leia go one way, Luke has to find the Jedi Master Yoda on his secluded swamp planet (voice of Frank Oz). Yoda may be the most lifelike character in ""Empire,"" and that's a pretty good compliment to a Muppet. We see Luke fail to master his Jedi powers, and we see him leave in haste to try to save Han and Leia who walk into a trap while visiting Han's old card playing friend, Lando Carisian (Billy Dee Williams). How Luke tries to save his friends is unimportant, as the single most shocking movie revelation comes during the final duel of the movie between Luke and Darth Vader. Unsuspecting movie goers have been blindsided by this scene for decades now. The tone, set by director Irvin Kershner, is darker and more serious, lends an adult feel to what is basically a kid's movie. The special effects are again top-notch, especially in the beautiful Cloud City and the fantastic looking asteroid field chase. Who knew in 1980 George Lucas had reached the pinnacle of his Star Wars franchise with a movie starring a green little troll voiced by the same guy who voices Miss Piggy?","

","arthurclay","8 June 2005","And damn if it didn't deliver the goods and a helluvalot more. It is so dark in theme it almost enters horror flick territory and that is brilliance in and of itself to go from one extreme to the other so fluidly and poetically. It worked in a way that The Temple of Doom just didn't with moviegoers. I suppose that was due in part to the cool suspenseful plot developments, particularly Yoda, Han and Leia's budding romance, but largely due to the Earth-shattering ""the world is not flat it's round"" surprise ending. I would bet when George Lucas wrote that scene down on paper he must have been either laughing maniacally and saying ""Nobody could ever have seen that coming in two billion light years!"" or crying with joy all the while with the one idea that ""This will be so golden that it will be remembered til the end of time and even after that."" As Hamill said so eloquently, ""In the Empire Strikes Back, everyone has problems. Luke has problems, Leia has problems, they turned Han into a coffee table!"" I must also include Silent Bob's quote ""She says 'I love you.' and like a pimp he says 'I know'."" It was the equivalent of dropping burning napalm on the audience. They must have been more stunned than people leaving the theaters after seeing the Exorcist for the first time. It was pure 100% movie magic and worthy of the original in every aspect.","

","Spondonman","1 June 2014","Back in 1977 I really enjoyed the first film in the franchise, but the hype was so enormous when this came out I decided to avoid it for a bit. I finally caught up with it in 1997 by which time Time had sadly caught up with it too and wreaked its usual damage. Then it was a case of Roll Over Harryhausen, tell Jim Henson the news.Story has imaginative intergalactic politics and battles amidst a plethora of gormless soap and stereotypes. To a kid it would be marvellous stuff to watch and as an adult to revel in through rose-tinted glasses, but coming at it as an adult I see it through the Empire's, sorry, Emperor's New Clothes and in the Altogether. It's relentlessly inventive but not in my top 1000 films of all time. Favourite bits: Luke yakking to Kermit about the Force; the flying city where expense or common sense is no object; the love affair between the Princess and the Scoundrel; the remarkably obvious pay-off, hyped at the time as something groundbreaking.The first cut is nearly always the deepest - long live the brash first film, this sequel is entertaining and nonsensical, an eminent time-passer. The first was a monument to Luck, the second a monument to Hype; I love fantasy movies of all eras and genres but mainly those not surrounded by heaps of hype swallowed by millions of people, it's a real barrier to my complete enjoyment of anything. This is a watchable movie but only a must-watch movie to see for what digital cgi cartoonery has done to the movies, and to us. Modern cgi is usually cold and soulless but usually not jerky and laughable, cgi has spoilt us all and there's no going back. However, now to watch Jason & The Argonauts and curse Roger Rabbit.","

","Marx_Bros_Fan86","21 February 2007","Since its release The Empire Strikes Back has gained a lot of popularity, and it is now widely considered to be the best of the series. Initially many people were disappointed with its cliffhanger ending. I know I wouldn't want to wait three years for the answer to the ""big question"" that was surely on everyone's minds! Anyway, I think Empire has become widely respected for its maturity in comparison to the other Star Wars movies. It's much more dramatic than A New Hope, and it doesn't have the cutesy aspects of Return of the Jedi. Until Revenge of the Sith, Empire was the darkest Star Wars movie. Empire clearly beats it in the execution department though. All of the characters are put into the worst situations imaginable and have to fight their way out.I think Empire's greatest strength is the character development of Luke, Han, and Leia. Luke faces his greatest fear (confronting Vader) and a romance blooms between Han and Leia. While the script and the performances are not Oscar worthy I do think this Star Wars movie has the best performances in the series. I believe this is largely due to Irvin Kirshner taking over the director's helm for Lucas. Lucas is notorious for not being very good with actors; his trademark instructions are ""do it faster and more intense."" Kirshner and Producer Gary Kurtz made sure a lot of care went into the character moments. Personally I don't think Lucas would have done that. Another aspect I like is the fact that the character development is very well balanced, so it doesn't feel like any of the principle characters are just tag-alongs, like in ROTJ. Darth Vader becomes the ultimate bad ass here in his hunt for Luke. My favorite Vader line: ""The Force is with you young Skywalker... but you are not a Jedi yet."" The lightsaber duel is my favorite of the series as well. There was something evil about the Carbon Freezing Chamber, perhaps it was that red glow.Empire brought us to some of the best locations in the series, such as the swamp planet Dagobah, the ice planet Hoth, and Cloud City. This happens to be the only Star Wars movie that doesn't have Tattooine. The snow speeder battle contains some excellent stop motion animation which holds up very well today. It certainly was unusual to put the major dogfight scene in the beginning of the movie rather than at the end, but I don't think many people complained.We are also introduced to new characters like Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch), and Yoda. Frank Oz's performance is nothing short of amazing. He deserves a great deal of credit for turning a rubber puppet into a living, breathing person. Like Lucas said, if that puppet hadn't worked the whole movie would have been lost. One valid criticism of Empire is that the action really just stops once Luke lands on Dagobah. I can't say I was ever bored by Empire's middle act. I found Luke's Jedi training and Han and Leia's moments to be thoroughly entertaining. However, I can perfectly understand why a casual moviegoer would be bored by this act. Either way, EBS is still a must see for any film buff.","

","film-critic","18 March 2008","Hoth. Yoda. Cloud City. That moment when you realize family really does matter  priceless.Individually these words represent small facets of pop culture, making whatever the question is in Trivial Pursuit obviously ""Star Wars"", but when you put them together, in this order, the words ""Empire Strikes Back"" will inevitably fall from your mouth. The second chapter (or fifth, however you count them) in Lucas' grandiose space opera involves a frozen planet, a little green man, the force, family, and eventually a good old fashioned hand losing. (Should I have put Billy Dee Williams somewhere in there?) A personal favorite among the original three, I grapple with words because what can be said about this film that hasn't already been said dozens, even hundreds of times. This is a staple to my youth, a film series that I have seen over and over in no particular order. For this viewing, I went with the classic Laserdisc edition which reminded me that no amount of special effect could change the heart of the story. What can be said? What should be said? In Skywalker's famous words to Yoda, ""I can give it a try""  we all know, by heart, what will follow next.""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the strongest chapter in the original trilogy for three reasons. The first is that we have three subsequent chapters, each dealing with a different world, in a different galaxy far, far away. Lucas, in my eyes, has expanded his opera into more than just a desert planet, or a wooded terrain, or on a star that causes death; he grew and blossomed with this film. As audience members, we believe in each of the settings, we understand how cold it is on Hoth, we can feel the moisture on Degoba planet, and our fear of heights is prevalent in Cloud City. Lucas defines, travels, and leaves out no detail as he escapes with us through this expanding universe. Moving onto a second note, this is a darker chapter. Without repeating what so many others have said before, Lucas challenges us to escape from scene after scene of battle (albeit he does put a small dusting in) and listen to the words that his characters are telling us. He places small Easter eggs throughout that still gives us goose bumps as we watch (and understand), he hints towards the final chapter, but without really giving us the entire sandwich, just a sample. This smattering of the unknown, the final scenes where Vader reveals his journal's secret to Luke, the iconic nature of the slicing of the hand, all of this matches against any battle scene any science fiction director could create. Lucas has always been criticized for his lack of character development in his six-part series, and with Jar-Jar I can understand, but he had hit his stride with what he wanted from his leads. I could see the spark between Leia and Han, the love between Chewie and C3PO, and Yoda's Oz like abilities when he explains to Luke that the force lives in nature. Lucas is telling us, giving us the chance to see that the final battle will be a line up between Nature and Machine  get ready Ewoks. Finally, this film is the strongest because it is a victorious battle for the dark side of the force. Very rarely do movie audiences walk out of a theater and feel as if hope has been crushed on the curb. Each time I view this film, I get this child-like sensation that maybe, just maybe, Vader and the Emperor will crush this little Rebel Alliance in the final chapter and reign supreme forever. ""Empire Strikes Back"" gives you that sense of possible dark side victory, with the call of the bounty hunters, the frozen carbonate, and the loss of Skywalker's ambidextrous abilities. Think of it this way, was the Dark Side really that evil, or did they just wear black and pursue those that were unwilling to follow the law? Goth British police officers?In all honesty, ""Empire Strikes Back"" could be re-watched at this moment. There are less big fight sequences than in ""Return of the Jedi"", and there are less moments of confusion and droid humor, ""Empire"" stands on its own because it remains an elusive, dark chapter. Our leads, those that we have given our hopes, hearts, and dreams to, have all been fooled, tricked, or captured, and it feels confined (like it is only the Millennium Falcon vs. an entire armada of Star Destroyers) in this middle chapter. You leave the theater wondering about that infamous ""Who shot J.R.?"" moment, and a desire to see the Force be victorious. To me, this middle chapter gave the Dark Side of the Force an equal opportunity to make a case for itself; ""Star Wars"" is an equal opportunity employer.Obviously, I loved this film. It has been a staple, like so many others, in my youth for years and further into my adulthood. I love these characters, these worlds, the unknown, and especially Lucas' vision. Despite the criticism of the ""new"" chapters, we will always have the original to go back to in any shape or form. Without sounding repetitive, watch this series. Introduce your children to this world(s), and allow them to grow up with the largest space opera created. Spark their imagination, and you will not be disappointed.Grade: ***** out of *****","

","Yodagirl-2","13 August 1999","While the Titanic made all the rich people (with the exception of Molly Brown and Rose) automatically uncaring, snobby, and thoughtless just because they were rich and needed a couple of villains for the story, The Empire Strikes Back did not portray ""the villain"" in a completely evil light. Sympathy is induced when we see the back of Darth Vader's scarred and pasty head.  When he tells Luke of their blood relationship, some feeling is allowed to creep in, telling us that he is not just some maniacal killing machine, but a human, fallen from grace, yet able to retain some sense of love, however twisted it may be.","

","bradykitchen-33648","8 May 2022","After the Empire takes control of the rebel base on Hoth, our core group is divided. Luke Skywalker sets off to continue his Jedi training, while Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3PO are running from the Empire.This is in my opinion the best Star Wars film ever, and one of the best films ever. They take what I consider to be a 10/10 movie in ""A New Hope"" and take it a step further with great character development, intense action, and improved visuals.First and Foremost across the board great acting. Everyone is on top of their game and gives their best possible performance.We get to see Luke begin his training with Yoda. Yoda is easily one of my favourite Star Wars characters and I love every scene he is in. When Luke finds out that Han and Leia are in trouble he makes the hard decision to save them and face Vader without having finished his training. This of course leads to the iconic reveal that Darth Vader is Luke's father. That moment is one of the greatest moments in cinematic history, everyone watching Star Wars for the first time is surprised by that reveal.Han, Leia, Chewbacca and C-3PO provide us with some sweet action sequences when they are being chased by the empire. They also lead us to the introduction of Lando Calrissian, who is an old friend of Hans.The score by John Williams is just as iconic as before and the new and improved visuals make for an even more immersive experience.This is one of the greatest movies ever made and the fact that they were able to take what was already a phenomenal film and make it better is insanely impressive.10/10.","

","lee_eisenberg","4 October 2005","I don't know whether or not ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was better than ""Star Wars"" or not, but it's pretty much equally good. Since everyone knows the plot, I figure that I'll just talk about a few aspects. It's weird to think that Yoda was only introduced here; he's been such a central character in the series that it's easy to forget that he didn't star in Episode 4! In some ways, watching ""TESB"", you get the feeling that the people behind the scenes realized how lucky the series was making them, and so they decided to go all out. And they do just that. They played it to good effect here (I personally thought that ""Return of the Jedi"" overdid it a little). But anyway, the Force is with this movie from start to finish!","

","emeraldreprobates","3 September 2015","The second installment of the original Star Wars trilogy benefits from coming from a time when there were very few films that could be called that. If it was made and released now it would be lost in a sea of big budget battles of good and evil aimed at making big money for a week or two and then disappearing.Thankfully it's from a time when it became one of the biggest films of the year or even the decade and it went on to inspire what the film industry is today. Without Star Wars and its army of nerds leading the way, there is no Marvel attempt to take over films and no comic-con and you would be looking at a very different world.This film has great moment and legendary quotes or misquotes and of course it has its flaws but what blockbuster doesn't and in the end it is a Star Wars film so it's worth watching.Featured on Episode 69 of The Emerald Reprobates Podcast.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","zkonedog","11 March 2017","In terms of action and adventure, ""Empire Strikes Back"" is a rousing success. There are enough space flights, phaser blasts, and lightsaber wielding to satisfy the visual effects junkies. The only thing missing, however, is that ""sense of something epic"" inherent in its original predecessor.In ""Episode V"", as it has come to be known, the rebels are still being pursued by the Empire, this time on the ice planet Hot. The first half of the film focuses on those battles, primarily featuring Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). A new character in Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) is also introduced, though his loyalties are very much in question. The second half deals more with Luke Skywalker's (Mark Hamill) beginning steps to becoming a Jedi. After the death (in Part IV) of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke goes to continue his training with Yoda, an enigmatic little green character seemingly older than time itself. The film's climax brings forth the long-awaited meeting of Luke and Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones), as well as a startling (if now clichéd) revelation that sets the stage for the final chapter.Though a good movie in its own right, I always felt as if this one lagged behind the original in certain key areas. A recent watching confirmed this. I think the ""trouble"" stems from the fact that ""Empire"" is much more of an action film than a drama. Whereas ""New Hope"" was so incredibly genre-diverse, ""Empire"" takes that same cast of characters and instead relies a bit too much on laser blasts and space maneuvers. It doesn't help that certain scenes (inside the ""asteroid""; Lando's scenes) just feel a little draggy...like filler.Overall, though, this is still a very watchable film that keeps the main storyline pushing forward. For special effects or action/adventure buffs, this one will stand out. For others, it may fall just a tick behind the original.","

","gigan-92","26 June 2009","This is the cream of the crop for not just the original trilogy, but the entire saga. To me, this film even surpasses the original. Everything is finally perfect, for just this one time. The tone is generally dark and somber, something Episode VI tried to live up to. But thanks to things called Ewoks it didn't quite keep the tone steady. The comic relief is given at the right moment and isn't over done.Rather, this film puts all the characters through their own turmoil and emotional battles. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher's love story is more drawn out and ends in a somewhat tragic way you could say. Luke, still played by good ole Mark Hamil, is finally on the road to becoming a Jedi Knight but his crusade against the Empire hits a stop as we find out one little detail left out in the previous one: ""Luke, I am your father.""""Nooooooo!!!! No!!!!!!"" Yes, Hamil could've done a little better here, but it doesn't take away from the moment as the horrible truth comes out. Lucas really outdoes himself here. Now the audiences can't wait for the third, and at the time, final installment. The action here is also well delivered, this film introducing much more environments than the last. The SFX are better than ever, especially on Hoth with the AT-TT Walkers and asteroid scene. The lightsaber duel at the climax is much improved from the rather stiff one in the original and we really see the extent of Vader's power. The music is, as always, superb, one of John William's best ever. Episode V is no less than epic.","

","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","1 April 2007","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning After George Lucas's Star Wars had wowed the world in 1977, the same world eagerly waited the big sequel that followed three years later, that was loved just as much, in some cases slightly more so, than the first film. It no doubt took twice as much effort to make, and drew in a huger box office crowd, and in doing so The Empire Strikes Back established itself as the film that rivalled the film it followed on from.All the main characters from the first film are back, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness) and lovable non humans Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO, along with new addition Lando (a charismatic turn by Billy Dee Williams) a rogue pal of Han's who's now the head of his own establishment, as well of course as Yoda, the tiny green martian with wisdom who guides Luke on his way. The story's a bit too lost in names of special planets, spaceships and character names that only the most ardent sci-fi nerd is going to follow intently, but once again, the sheer spectacle and grandeur of Lucas's work over-shadows everything, a remarkable vision that still hasn't dated or staled over 25 years on.So sit back, relax and prepare to witness the sheer scale of escapist entertainment. *****","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","PeterPPK","26 October 2009","The first Star Wars movie, is a Sci-fi and cinematic masterpiece. But where Star Wars capitalized, Empire Strikes Back took it to the next level.Here's what I think of the movie: Story - I'm pretty sure we all know the story of Star Wars. A Galactic Empire is empowering the galaxy, and a Rebel Alliance tries to stop it. Today, it's sort of a cliché plot but back then, it was imagination skyrocketing into the heavens. Now, thats the plot of Star Wars. The story spans from a battle on the frigid planet of Hoth, to a space dogfight in an asteroid field, to Cloud City where the greatest plot twist in the history of cinema, is reveled. The film ends on a cliffhanger which leads to Return of the Jedi. I'm not going to spoil it, but I don't think I would need to because I'm willing to bet that about 99.99% of people have already seen this movie anyway(to that .01%, where the hell have you been?).-Rating 10/10 Characters - The characters from the original movie are back, including Luke, Han, Leia, C3P0 and R2D2, and of course, Darth Vader. But the films also introduces some new characters as well, including Lando, The Emperor, Boba Fett, and Yoda. The Emperor doesn't really play a big part in the movie(I think he only has like, 10 lines) and Boba's name is never really mentioned. However, Yoda plays a big part by teaching Luke the ways of the force, and Lando, who is Han's old pal, plays a big part by betraying our heroes and giving them to Vader. Of course, he's still a good guy, he had to hand them over. Overall, I'd say the characters are still great.Rating 10/10 Visuals - This was back when Star Wars movies didn't rape the fabric of CGI. So what you see in the movie were real things. The Walkers, asteroids, X-Wings, Tie Fighters, everything. The original Star Wars set the standards for Special Effects with the light sabers, Death Stars blowing up and everything. Empire Strikes Back isn't any different. The Effects are still awesome and look great.-Rating 10/10Music - The Star Wars theme is (of course) still here and it's one of the most recognized themes in cinema. You only need to hear a second of the Star Wars theme, and you'll know what it is. Like any other Star Wars film, the music is composed by John Williams, so everything is played by an orchestra. Even though it's great the here the Star Wars theme in all it's nostalgic glory, the music thats played is still just as great.-Rating 10/10 Overall - Empire Strikes back is my favorite Star Wars film and is one of my favorite movies. If I had to make a Top 10 list of my favorite movies, about 15 movies would be tied for the #1 spot, and this would be one of them. Everything about it is just perfect.Final rating : 10/10 -PeterPPK","

The story is great, and the character development is far more dark and gruesome than in the first film.

","Tweekums","7 October 2008","Like most children who loved Star wars when it was first released I looked forward to the next big screen instalment of the saga. I was not disappointed. The action started almost immediately and keeps up throughout the film till the climactic light sabre battle. We are also introduced to the new interesting characters Yoda, Lando and the Emperor himself.As the film begins the rebels are on the run, hiding on the barren ice planet of Hoth and the empire is dispatching droids to search the galaxy for them. One lands not far from Luke and he sets off to investigate but before he can get far he is attacked by a yeti-like creature which drags him off to an ice cave. Luke manages to escape but it is too late for him to get back to the base and it looks like he might freeze to death. Luckily for him Han is out searching for him and eventually finds him just after he has a vision of his old friend Obi-Wan Kenobi who tells him to seek a Jedi master called Yoda on the planet Dagobah. Once back at the base the soon learn that the Empire has discovered where they are and start to evacuate. While this is occurring they must hold off an attack by imperial walkers which are attempting to destroy the shield protecting the base. Eventually the base falls but not before our heroes can escape.At this point the action splits, Luke and R2 fly to Dagobah and Han, Chewie, Princess Leah and C3PO flee in the Millennium Falcon. When Luke arrives on Dagobah he discovers the planet is one huge swamp into which his X-wing sinks. He and R2 soon find a strange creature who says that he can take them to Yoda, of course it turns out that he is Yoda, after some persuasion he begins to train Luke. Meanwhile back on the Falcon things aren't going according to plan; when ambushed by imperial star destroyers they discover that the hyper-drive isn't working so must hide in a dangerous asteroid field. Flying into cave on one of the larger asteroids the attacked by strange creatures that feed on the ships power cables, when they go outside to remove them they discover that the cave itself isn't what they thought it to be so must flee once more into the path of the imperial forces. Being a crafty pilot Han manages to escape from them but is pursued by the bounty hunter Boba Fett.Needing repairs they head to Cloud City in the nearby Bespin system. Here they are met by Han's old friend Lando Calrissian who offers to help them. Unfortunately for them Darth Vader got there sooner and made a deal with Lando. Meanwhile Luke has a vision that his friends are in danger and ends his training early to go and help, despite Yoda's warning that he is at risk from the dark side of the force and could make things worse. When he gets there he confronts Vader who tells him something that goes against everything he thought to be true... in the very unlikely event that you don't know already I'll avoid spoiling it.Like the original film this is full of excellent special effects but isn't swamped with excessive CGI like the more recent prequels. The acting and direction are both pretty good. Being the middle act of the original trilogy it is much darker in tone than the first film and the ending can hardly be called happy. I'd certainly recommend this film to anybody regardless of their age, it is one of the few sequels to improve on the first film of its series.","

Rick McCollum should be tracked down and given a good kick in the pants.In your epic battles of good and evil, ""Empire Strikes Back"" pretty much takes the cake. We have everything here -- characters with depth, tragedy, romance, adventure... aliens that are believable. It has become cliché to compare ""Star Wars"" to ""Lord of the Rings"", and that's not entirely unfair... but, really, ""Star Wars"" is better and ""Empire Strikes Back"" is the best.As Dante Hicks says in ""Clerks"", this film is the best because it imitates life, ""a series of down endings"". Sometimes life is better than that, but it's often not. And whereas most movies want happiness, this one put Luke and Han in a bunch of bad situations with no hope of escaping unscathed.

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","luke-a-mcgowan","27 September 2015","In many ways, The Empire Strikes Back is the perfect sequel. But before I begin, let me get one thing out of the way. This is NOT the best Star Wars film of all time. That honour lies with the original, which it always will. There's a multitude of great scenes here, but I can and will argue that every one of them is derived from the original.In case the original Star Wars lulled you into a false sense of security - the Death Star is destroyed, Tarkin is dead and Vader is lost in space - Empire Strikes Back (the name says it all) opens with the iconic Battle of Hoth, where the rebels are once again on the run from an Empire with superior numbers and firepower. Everything about this battle sets the mood of Empire - most of which is spent on the run. If your heart isn't beating faster than usual when Vader is walking up to the Millennium Falcon, then you're straight up lying.There's no point wasting space talking about the performances in Empire Strikes Back, because Hamill, Fisher, Ford, Daniel and the actors behind Vader are just as good in this film as they were in the original. Ford and Fisher's on screen chemistry is what every movie couple aspires to be - it is not only believable but obvious that the Princess falls for the scoundrel Solo. Frank Oz joins the cast as the delightful Yoda, and his performance is perfect both in Yoda's wisest and most comedic moments. See also Billy Dee Williams, who became one of the franchise's most beloved characters in such a small amount of time. Williams' easy smile and commanding delivery shows us very clearly why he was in the conversation for the role of Han Solo.The reason that Empire Strikes Back is the perfect sequel is that it delves deeper into the parts we wanted to know more about. Yoda warns us that Luke is not right to be a Jedi, and then we watch Luke make the very mistakes Yoda was warning him about. Vader is built into an incredible villain in this movie - he knows Luke is his son and he still maims him. One of the things I loved in this movie was the similarity of Vader's approach to Admiral Ozell and Captain Needa's failures. Ozell is a buffoon and Needa an honest and upfront man willing to accept responsibility, and they both meet the same fate. Its a small thing, but it says so much about Vader's lack of empathy.Kershner is a very skilled director, probably the best in the franchise. Some of my favourite directed scenes include the devastating duel between Luke and Vader, where it is immediately obvious that Luke is out of his depth, and the incredible scene in which Vader's human head is revealed to the audience. A facial expression or change in body language is enough to speak volumes to the audience.I'm not in love with Empire Strikes Back. I find Hoth's Yeti, the giant asteroid worm, and the community's bizarre obsession with Boba Fett to be rather annoying. I also found Hoth, Dagobah and Bespin to be relatively flat and uninspired worlds by Star Wars standards. But they are all such tiny things in what is obviously an incredible film - the film that gave me my name.''Luke, I am your father.''","

The sword fights were much more impressive than in first part. The starship battles were also very impressive and pretty realistic.

First of all, the acting in this film is amazing, People who watched the film didn't know that actually most of Harrison Ford's lines were improvised, which is awesome. Carrie Fisher as Leia was great, especially when she talks to Ford, Frank Oz as Yoda is great, way better than CGI Yoda from the prequels. Luke as the hero was great, but I like how they show Luke as the hero, but he still loses, which brings me to Darth Vader. He is by far one of the best villains of all movie history, he is menacing, mysterious, then when he tells Luke, ""I am your father"", that completely changes how we first watched A New Hope. Effects are good for that time, also two others characters that I need to mention are Boba Fett and Lando Calrissian, these two characters really showed me that this is such a great movie franchise, Lando with huge charisma, and Boba being silent badass, so out of ten I would give this incredible movie a 10/10.

","johnnyboyz","7 January 2009","Good lord, what spell does George Lucas have everyone under? This is one of the highest ranked films on the website; it's regarded as one of the greatest sequels of all time; it's on most lists entitled the 'greatest motions pictures' of the respective genre; it's a film nearly everyone likes - and yet it failed, for me, to do any of these things justice upon recently seeing it for the first time. Perhaps you had to be there; to see it on opening night at a time when there was no such thing as the Internet on which you could download and/or watch special teasers or trailers; at a time when the studio were not able to give you the first five minutes as an appetiser to get you to see it; at a time when the only manner in which you could discuss the up and coming franchise episodes were face-to-face and not on message boards. Although it's too bad it isn't more like that nowadays.Maybe it's futile criticising it now, but at the end of the day, it's still just a film. Perhaps you really did have to be there on opening night with no knowledge of what awaited you, preparing yourself to be propelled into a world of monsters, space travel and aliens as you left your brain at the door. But I do think most people rate the film based on childhood experiences more than the film itself  they don't ask themselves the question 'How good was the film?', they ask themselves 'How happy was I as a kid when I first saw this?'.For the record, I liked the previous episode. I thought it was good fun and relatively light-hearted with a sense of vision going for it throughout. You really believed Lucas had an idea and desperately wanted to follow through on his vision. This twinned with the scope of ideas to do with space travel and the structuring of space stations, look of attire and general mise-en-scene enforces the evidence Lucas loved an idea to the point it was an obsession, an obsession he let everyone else into and love in equal measure.Alas, Episode V entitled 'The Empire Strikes Back' from 1980 is actually quite silly and removes any feeling or excitement the prior episode may have instilled into one. Its overall idea is that the young and upcoming hero in Luke Skywalker (Hamill) is to go off and train to take his skills to the next level and become a Jedi whilst friends Han Solo (Ford) and co. are chased down by the evil forces led by Darth Vader (Prowse/Jones).'Fine' you think, this may well be more interesting now that the introductions and general establishment of good versus evil has been dealt with; there also seems to be a self discovery journey going on. But if anything, the film is less interesting than the first one, particularly after about an hour after which it transcends into a bunch of slightly interesting scenes set on space ships and odd jungle infested planets. Once all that has happened, Vader gets some hired guns to find the rebels and more stuff happens that just has you passively sit there and watch it all unfold.Maybe it's that I cannot just let myself go, but I had no problem with the 1st and 4th episodes in terms of narrative, which were actually quite interesting as this broad and quite epic setting was used to transfer good and evil across a galaxy. In this one, there doesn't feel like anything at stake. The film's protagonist Luke is safe and sound on a jungle planet with Yoda, being taught what he needs to know, so he's fine, whereas Solo and co. are hopping around trying to dodge the forces of evil and the problem is you never feel any connection to them. Why should you feel any towards an annoying, big, hairy creature; daft comic relief robots and an underdeveloped, expressionless and somewhat empty headed woman who goes by the name Leia (Fisher).But these things are the bigger picture. The film has all number of frustrations going on at spaced intervals. Of course, Solo and co. never get hit by any of the laser beams and they can hide in that meteor storm nice and easily but again, criticising it seems futile. One thing I noticed on several occasions was that everyone in the Millennium Falcon kept talking over each other, which also annoyed me and the heavy handed catalyst which pushes Luke off into his training with Yoda is a near death experience on ice planet Hoth, during which he nearly freezes to death amongst being eaten.Towards the end of the film, Luke will be having a showdown with Vader after which a famous line is uttered. All well and good but Luke doesn't go down into the bowels to fight Vader because it's the realistic choice, he goes down there because we want him to  we want him to fight and the story demands he put his new Jedi skills into practice so that all can see how much he's really learnt. This is after the film goes needlessly 'dark' for one scene involving the freezing/supposed death of a main character and no, the film is 'dark' for that one scene; not from the start and throughout, it's still that laser dodging, fast talking, monster eliminating 'fun' the prior film was. All in all, The Empire Strikes Back is underwhelming and viewing it now makes it seems quite silly more than anything. Perhaps proof 'event cinema' can and never will withstand the true test of time.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","Hey_Sweden","1 July 2013","Story author and executive producer George Lucas truly managed to outdo himself when it came to making a sequel to his landmark 1977 ""Star Wars"" film. It combines an appreciably high level of character development with some genuinely exciting and riveting scenes, and introduced the well loved character of diminutive Jedi master Yoda into the formula. Villainous Darth Vader is brought to the forefront rather than being a lackey to somebody else. The relationship between cocky spaceship pilot Han Solo and serious minded rebel leader Princess Leia evolves to where romance can finally take place. And Luke Skywalker becomes more than just the naive and idealistic farm boy, letting his emotions get the better of him.With the directing chores being handed over to Irvin Kershner (""A Fine Madness"", ""Up the Sandbox"", ""Eyes of Laura Mars""), ""The Empire Strikes Back"" marks a maturation in terms of story quality, as well as a willingness to go to some dark places. After all, as it begins, it sees its hero in serious jeopardy. It's never treated as a given that Good will prevail. The screenplay is credited to Leigh Brackett (""The Big Sleep"", ""Rio Bravo"", ""El Dorado"") and Lawrence Kasdan (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Body Heat"", ""The Big Chill""), and stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher make the most of the material. The endearing Yoda is one of those examples of a puppet who truly does become a character rather than just a gimmick. The film is a little short on cool aliens, but it does feature a Yeti-like monster called a Wampa, and an enormous slug used in a funny ""worm in the apple"" sort of gag. The spectacle is fantastic, but it never overwhelms the story. The early battle scene on the ice fields of the planet Hoth is incredibly well executed, and the final lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader (who of course has a revelation in store for the youngster) offers one thrill after another.The special effects are as impressive as ever, and it would be difficult to hear that memorable John Williams score and not get into the spirit of the thing. You truly care about the characters and want to see what will happen with them. And it delivers an ending that perfectly captures a sense of uncertainty and a degree of despair, setting up the problems to be solved in the next film.This is definitely a milestone blockbuster that holds up well 33 years later.10 out of 10.","

","juzzy_anderson","5 August 2006","I am A Star Wars fan, always have been. The difference was the direction in this film there were standards set. The Imperial Theme is one of the most well known themes and has been repeatedly parodied although it has kept respectable as time wears on. Darth Vader is given more than barking orders in ""A new Hope"" Boba Fett the most feared and universally loved Bounty Hunter even though he had only one line in the first three series makes his debut but actions speak louder than words. David Prowses body Language as the dark lord mixed with James Earl Jones voice is iconic. The budding romance between Han and Leia was a surprise when I first saw this. I thought for sure Luke would get it on with her, but Lucas had other plans which I was really happy about.The suspense is really built and when I was seven years old watching this film I hung on every word. I still do. The real difference is the direction and the attention to detail. The asteroid scene was new. John Williams thematics set the cornerstone of the film and a relentless chase through the stars for Luke Skywalker by a driven Dark lord is answered at the climax. The screenplay is more mature than the original and any of the others following. It is what is left unsaid that carries this film and makes it highly re-watchable.I'm going to give this film a nine it still excites me and is the real beginning of the story and for all it's worth I appreciate the prelude to it as well. This film delivers the emotional punch that has captured fans for decades and cemented a niche in the industry. Enjoy","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","Ggconte","7 July 2022","It's not easy making a sequel to a hit movie, especially when Episode 5 was being made as sequels were not as common. So, it goes without saying that no one knew what to expect.Written by George Lucas and directed by Irvin Kershner, Episode 5 takes place not too long after it's predecessor. The Rebellion is still fighting the Empire as they just barely manage to escape from another battle as Luke is sent to be trained by one of Obi-Wans former teachers, Yoda. Han, Leia and Chewbacca are on the run from the Empire and are forced to seek help from an old friend of Hans, Lando, as their ship is damaged.Meanwhile, Darth Vader is not only hunting for them but Luke as well. We see him go to great lengths to find them and eventually threatens Lando to turn them in.All the while, Luke finally finds Yoda and proceeds with his Jedi training. However, he senses the danger everyone is in and leaves Yoda to save them. During this time, Han is frozen and taken away and Lando helps Leia and Chewbacca escape. Luke arrives and duels with Darth Vader, not only losing the battle but discovering that Vader is indeed Anakin Skywalker, his father.The combination of Kershner and Lucas is one that I'm sure fans (myself included) wanted more often. This is not only the easiest Star Wars to follow but also the most down to earth. Kershner helps ground Lucas' broad imagination, making not only the settings more realistic but the characters more relatable.The story is expertly paced, leaving little to no filler within the film. Every moment matters, and none is wasted on needless visuals, something Lucas is notorious for.The characters are given unbelievable depth, with Darth Vader probably being the most intriguing. Even when not factoring in the prequels and recent season finale of Kenobi, Vader's presence and power is on another level when compared to Episode 4 and learning of his connection to Luke makes him even more interesting.I also love the love triangle between Luke, Han and Leia. Yes I know what the third film will reveal but it not only helps establish the dilemma between the three but it also makes their relationship appear stronger, especially with Han and Luke, as they still will do anything to help one another.The action is splendid. The effects still look tremendous and like I said before, they aren't just there to look cool, they help tell the story.The acting in this film is why I really wish Kershner was kept on for later films, including Episodes 2 and 3. He not only allows a lot more improvisation and leeway with the scripting but makes sure that each actor delivers their all with each take.So overall, this is the perfect Star Wars movie. My wife, who absolutely hates Star Wars, watched this movie for the first time all the way through and loved it. Definitely in the top five for films that should be watched by everybody.","

","judemcrobbie","1 February 2021","The cultural and technological significance of The Empire Strikes Back speaks for itself. It revolutionised CGI and practical effects to a whole new level.
The characters are so good, no wonder why they're so iconic. Everything points to the director having an idea of the characters created: Yoda's monologue about the force is so beautiful, it embodies the love Yoda has for it. And Han Solo's ""I know"" is so to character, keeping that arrogant and boastful persona as he would.
The use of the force is the epitome of subtlety as it creates this beautiful living organism.
It's a cinematic masterpiece: where the CGI might not hold up today, the cinematography certainly does, clearly inspiring movies to come.
Obviously it's one of the greatest action movies, let alone movies in total.
For some reason I prefer A New Hope","

","snoozejonc","23 July 2020","The story of the rebellion against the Galactic Empire continues with Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie, R2 and 3PO on another blistering ride.The best praise I can give The Empire Strikes Back is that it was the first Star Wars movie to hold my 3 year old daughter's attention for the entire duration, and it's easy to see why as virtually every scene is a new and interesting story.Several great characters are introduced such as Yoda, Lando, Boba Fett, and the Emperor, who add further interest to the overarching story, while the original movies favourites of Han, Chewie, Leia, Luke, Darth Vader, and the droids continue to entertain.There are countless cinematic moments such as the Hoth planet scenes, the epic chemistry between Han and Leia, and virtually everything that happens on Degaba and in the Cloud City. The classic scene with Luke and Vader is so atmospheric and dramatic you will be hard pressed not to find yourself role-playing it with your own children one day.John Williams is the true star of the show as his music fits the emotion of every scene perfectly. I still catch my daughter humming the Imperial March to herself from time to time.Visually it is one of the greatest movies of all time, with groundbreaking (for the time) effects, excellent cinematography, editing, action sequences, puppetry, sets, costumes and battles. Likewise the sound effects are wonderful.The performances include memorable turns from James Earl Jones, Frank Oz, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Anthony Daniels.Some consider it to be superior to the original Star Wars (A New Hope) and they may well have a point. It is darker, more intriguing, delivers an excellent twist, and ends on the edge of a cliff. However, the spectacle didn't awe me on the same level as the original. This is not fault of the sequel, as it simply came second, and much like a junkie chasing their first high I never quite achieved the same feeling.(This review is for the original theatrical release and not the special edition)","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","ElMaruecan82","4 October 2016","""The Empire Strikes Back"" does its best to visually surpass the original ""Star Wars"" and the special effects or the creatures' designs are as convincing as the pioneering space epic, there's also a richness of landscapes, taking you from the snowy summits of a cold planet to the tropical jungle, but beyond the escapism, it's the excitement to see again that iconic gallery of characters, Han Solo, Leia, C3PO, R2-D2, Luke, Chewbacca (whose mourning and moaning sounds took a whole other resonance) and a few newcomers. In ""The Empire Strikes Back"", the key word is ""Back"". Now, take the most hardcore ""Star Wars"" fan -I think there's a name for them, and I guess I would know if I were one- and take someone who doesn't care much about the series, now, ask the pair to list four or five classic ""Star Wars"" moments, I bet a good half of the scenes will belong to the glorious episode V ""The Empire Strikes Back"", directed by Irvin Keshner (and George Lucas as the Executive Producer). By the way, do you know the joke, why did Lucas start ""Star Wars"" with the 4th, 5th and 6th episodes and then made the first three? Because Master Yoda directed them (punch line drum sound). Well, that's just to show you I didn't use the word 'sequel', and this is not because I don't want to offend sensitivities, but because I don't take the film as a sequel but as the real journey into the soul of ""Star Wars"", the dark side, literally.It is in this film that the relationship between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) transcends the limits of the simple crush, the interactions between them are really catching and you can tell that Harrison Ford challenges his character, and has fun teasing the little Princess who's not insensitive to his charm. A film where actors have fun playing their characters can't turn bad, and it is a credit to the directing for having made the romance efficient with no more than three or four scenes. And they all culminate with one of the most touching declarations of love, touching because of its laconic but sincere answer you know. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is also the film that pursues the coming-of-age of Luke Skywalker and features his initiation by Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz). Obi-Wan was a great character but Yoda has everything, the speech mannerism, the mimics and this little quality that makes him like the perfect crossover between Mr. Myagi and ""E.T."" except that he came the first. Yoda is the heart of the story, and when he warns Luke about the dark side of the Force, he knows exactly where he's heading to, and I guess ever since ""Star Wars"" ended, the audience knew what the next film had to deliver. Which leads to the one true reason-to-be of the film, the climactic light-saber battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker right after having plunged us into the evil Empire Lord's psyche and revealed the Shakespearian truth about his identity. Now, is it really a spoiler to spoil it or is it a of prescription case? In a Simpson episode from the third season, which means 1992, a gag consisted on Homer leaving the theater and spoiling the ending to all the lining up moviegoers. So after one decade, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was already part of cinema's history. I guess you can't call yourself a movie lover but if you don't know Vito Corleone, Scarlett O'Hara or the father of Luke Skywalker, well it kind of shades off to ignorance. Indeed, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is like the second tome of Homer's Odyssey, it is an inevitable and valuable portion of Cinema's history regarding perhaps the one true myth that solely belongs to the silver screen. And it is for this achievement that it's impossible not to recognize the cinematic value of ""The Empire Strikes Back"". Say what you want about the creatures, the special effects, the little gimmick or childish moments, but when the film starts and you have in order, the 'Fox' logo, the 'long time go' title card-and then the first pumping sound of the triumphant fanfare, something melts inside you and you're like a child who just sat on the roller- coaster. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was the most anticipated movie, the follow-up to the all time most popular film and it managed to become more popular by injecting novelty within the relationships and add new characters such as Yoda or Lando (Billy Dee Williams). It even managed to equal the original by having its own score: ""The Imperial March"", as if it had to have its own existence independently from the first, and it's fitting that the score is about the villain as Darth Vader seems more majestic and frightening in this opus, actually he was nominated #3 in the AFI's Top 50 villains but it was the Darth Vader from ""Empire"", the one with the Imperial March. Even Vader raises its iconic status with his (temporary) victory over the rebels. Because that's also what characterizes the film, the bad guys have the upper hand. It concludes with a frozen Han Solo, an amputated Luke with the painful knowledge about his origins, a disintegrated C3PO and so on a cliffhanger so obvious it doesn't even need the obligatory ""to be continued"", we know the fight between evil and good isn't over. I guess at that moment, ""The Return of the Jedi"" immediately became the most anticipated cinematic project.","

","arthur_tafero","9 January 2023","The first three installments of the Star Wars series of films are easily the best three of the entire series; and this film, The Empire Strikes Back, is the best of the top three. If for no other reason, the development and dramatic impact of the Darth Vader character within this film sets it apart from all the others. When Vader utters those famous five words in a battle scene, we remember them for the rest of our lives. The intensity of this film is greater than the first or third one (and far more than the latter entries). Not one, but a trio of characters, are fleshed out in this film more than in any other Star Wars entry. Obiwan, Luke, and Vader all have great character development. The music is outstanding, the cinematography is outrageously good, and the script is more sophisticated than the first entry. Don't miss the best of the Stars Wars films.What idiots thought that Pulp Fiction or Fight Club were better films than this one?

And if they are there, they're generally less noticeable)Bigger and more ambitious action scenesPacing is just flawlessDialogue is sharper; the banter between characters is much betterIt's better shot from a visual standpoint, too. The first Star Wars had plenty of iconic images for sure, but this one just feels more cinematic, with better camerawork, lighting, and use of colour.The new locations are also great.Uses a satisfying three-act structure that still somehow feels exciting and unpredictable (if you've not seen it before, of course)Characters are fantastic, as are the new additions to the cast (Yoda's scenes are gold- every single second of them)Empire is more menacing, and the heroes are in near constant peril. Death Vader being properly unchained from Tarkin made him the iconic villain he's known as today.That twist is so well known by this point, but if you try to imagine being in a theatre and hearing that for the first time in 1980, it would have been mind blowingEvery character now openly finds C3PO annoying, so his comic relief goes from laughing ""with him"" (which scarcely worked in the first film) to more or less laughing ""at him,"" which is way funnier.It's dark by Star Wars standards but it's not depressing. There's plenty of fun and action, and a surprising amount of humour that largely works- it balances the seriousness with the excitement and the humour perfectly.Ending satisfies while also leaving you hungry for the concluding chapter (which had its moments, but seems to get a little worse upon each revisit, while Empire Strikes Back only seems to get better with age).This is absolutely a near masterpiece that's hard to fault to be honest... but you didn't need my ramblings to tell you that.","

With the rebellion now hiding on the snow planet of ""Hoth"", ""Luke Skywalker"" travels to ""Dagobah to find Jedi master ""Yoda"" so he can be trained in the ways of the Jedi.This is and most likely will always be my favourite ""Star wars"" film. The film is near enough flawless.The positivesThis film is sort of historical mostly because it has one of the greatest twists in cinematic history and has an ending which no one saw coming. The film isn't about the rebels getting another win over the empire, it's about the heroes struggling and managing to survive in the end. It's an emotional ending that is really satisfying and gets you excited for the finale. The twist is something I won't spoil but I'll always remember the first time I saw this film and just being shocked to the core with what was said. The lightsaber fight is the heat of the entire Star Wars saga. It holds plenty of emotion and it's not a fight where ""Vader"" and ""Luke"" try to kill each-other. ""Vader"" is toying with ""Luke"" to show him the power of the dark side. To try and show how powerful he can become. The characters are well written. Mostly with ""Luke"". He fails so much in the film. He gives up sometimes but he always tries again later. He has no fear too. He does not hesitate to face ""Vader"" when he has a vision. His arc also teaches us to be patient. We can't rush into things all the time no matter how much we want to do the thing we're trying to do. His teachings with ""Yoda"" also teach the audience in some ways. Lessons of patience and not letting your emotions get the better of you are told brilliantly. The acting is great too. Everyone does a better job in this film. The romance that develops between ""Han"" and ""Leia"" is charming. It's not awkward, the dialogue is great and the chemistry between the actors is great. The special effects look better than the first film. Thankfully ""George"" knew this was a great film that didn't need changing much. So we still see a lot of the original effects. Finally, the film is also incredibly funny. So many of the jokes and funny lines are placed perfectly. They don't interfere with the emotional moments and they bring some light hearted moments to an all round sad film.The negativesThe only slight negative I have is that the film isn't laced amazingly. It feels slightly longer than it's runtime. But it's only a small negative that doesn't affect the rating.Conclusion""The Empire strikes back"" is near enough a perfect movie. The plot, the twist, action, well written characters, special effects, romance, comedy and themes are all perfect. Apart from the pacing, the film is flawless.I'm going to give ""Star wars- episode V: The Empire strikes back"" a:10/10.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","adamjohns-42575","26 May 2023","Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) -Before I start the review of this film I will state that I do love it, because I love all of the Star Wars universe, especially the original trilogy, but also because it was a really well made film and it was delivered excellently in the same way as the first.I may ramble and reminisce a bit too much at times, not there should be some sort of point to it and actually that's the affect that these films have on a lot of people.This film didn't fall in to the usual trap of a sequel, with repetition and pointless continuation just for the sake of making money. It had some great moments, including laughs, action, space fighting, romance, the whole lot and with an original plot that continued the story because it needed to.I wouldn't have liked to have turned up to it without having seen 'Star Wars' (1977) beforehand and if you have to finish things off due to some sort of O. C. D., like I do, you will need to watch the next one, 'Star Wars: Return Of The Jedi' (1983) too, because this one ends on a cliffhanger.It works as Episode ""V"" of the original 3 (V, IV & VI - Ask George) and of the larger nonet that it became with the release of the Prequel Trilogy (1999/2002/2005?) and the more recent Sequels (2015/2017/2019) too and many regard it very highly on its own, but it certainly couldn't have been released or have been so successful without Episode IV, because I needed to know where they came from, who Ben was, why Luke had magic powers and so on.With that aside, I think that I mostly tend to appreciate this film, because I only remember seeing ""IV"" and ""VI"" on TV as a child, with maybe a few clips of this one, until my parents finally got a Video Cassette Player and of course the all important Cassettes to go with it, which came quite a bit later due to these highly popular productions actually being quite expensive back then.As a result I probably haven't seen this one as often as the other two, but feel a nostalgia based on a clearer teenage mind watching it almost new, as opposed to a 7 year old's memories of cute Teddy Bears (Ewoks) for instance.The story and the character development was great, because it meant that there was more of the universe that I already loved and I got to know my favourites better, whilst other great personalities like Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and Yoda (Frank Oz) were introduced.""Empire"" actually had some of the better jokes, a great story and many of the classic moments that have since been turned in to memes. Harrison Ford looked mighty fine as Han Solo too.The update of the film, when it was digitally remastered, added some beautiful colours to places like Cloud City and clarity for the rest of the film. I also finally got to see more clearly what it was that attacked Luke at the beginning of the film, which, fun fact, was written in because of a car accident that he had in between recording, which left his face quite hideously disfigured.I also thought that they had realised that Harry had given them a lot more than they had expected in the first film and they seemed to have decided to expand his role in this one to make him more than just a roguish taxi driver. They later did the same, quite cleverly, with Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) in the sequel films, because although the Jedi bit is great, the films have always relied on these additional characters to keep the action going in other ways while the young Padawan gets trained or has extended laser sword fights.The brilliance of this instalment was also added to by yet another superb soundtrack provided by John Williams, who managed to almost completely create something new, on top of the existing themes, but without it being far far away from the general style of sound already used.As far as I'm concerned, you can't go wrong with any of the Star Wars films (Skip 'The Last Jedi' - 2017), because they contain so much heart and a vast knowledge of the film history that had been collated in George Lucas' mind while he grew up. That was obvious with nods to many of the other great epic western, medieval, sci-fi and war films and tales that went before and of course the polish he delivered with each of the films in this series, not to forget the brilliance that came from his own imagination and the superb supporting special effects created by the ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) studios.I look at other films from the late 70's and early 80's and wonder why they didn't put as much in to it as the people that made this original trilogy, because it obviously worked if you want to create something that lasted.962.22/1000.","

","The-Sarkologist","19 September 2021","Honestly, I just absolutely adore this film, and the further I travel in life, the more that I discover that I'm not the only one. In fact it seems to pretty much be the favourite of all of the Star Wars films, probably because there is so much happening, and also because of the big reveal at the end. In fact, the big reveal was kept so secret that only Mark Hammil, James Earl Jones, and the creators knew about it, which was why it was such a shock.In a way this film pretty much feels like it is the middle part of the trilogy, particularly since the end isn't really all that conclusive. In fact, it sort of feels more like a phyrric victory, though the fact that Han Solo has been captured, the Empire hasn't really suffered a defeat, and that the film closes with Luke and Leah simply standing on the deck looking out at the rebel fleet is a clear indication that there is more to come.Yet, I felt that this was the best ending of any of the Star Wars films, though it is probably the only one that could get away with it. The first one had to have a fairly conclusive ending, namely because there wasn't really much indication that there would be any more after that, and of course Return of the Jedi had to be conclusive because there was no indication that there was going to be any more after that either (the latest trilogy came about after Disney had purchased the franchise).I guess the thing that I loved about the film is that there is so much action, from the battle on the ice planet of Hoth, to the asteroid chase. In fact, the asteroid chase is probably the best of any film that I have ever seen - there isn't many space opera's that I've seen that happen to have a full blown chase through an asteroid belt. Yet there are some nice touches as well, particularly the commander that keels over and dies, and the holographic connection cuts out when his ship is hit by an asteroid. Oh, and the Emperor is also revealed in this film - in fact I'm not entirely sure whether he was even mentioned in the first film, though I probably should have paid a bit more attention when I watched it a couple of weeks previously.Honestly, there is little that I can probably say that hasn't already been said, and since this film seriously has a huge cult following, or at least the series does, then no doubt this is one of the films that pretty much everybody has seen, or at least everybody who has wanted to see this film has basically seen this film. The other interesting thing is that it didn't seem to be as altered as the previous film was, but as I have indicated previously, these films really didn't need to be altered since they were good enough as is.","

","I_am_Jacks_Revenge","16 November 2007","I think when this came out in 1980, no one saw the twist at the end coming. If you don't know the twist because you have been blocked from or chose to block the Star Wars saga, you are missing out. I don't know a lot of people who don't know how it ends.I will tell the story as best as I can since I don't have it at home (it's sad, I know): We begin at a very cold planet where Luke goes out and is missing. Many people want to give up searching for him. Meanwhile, Luke gets kidnapped by the 1980's version of an alien Abominable Snowman. After escaping the monster and killing it (I think), Luke goes out into the blizzard and sees Obi-Wan's spirit in the distance, telling him to go to Yoda on the planet Dagobah, and continue training. Han Solo finds him, about to freeze to death, and rescues him. Back at the base, they treat him and he makes a full recovery. Later on in the movie, the evil guys come to the planet and attack using those AT-AT walkers. The big battle begins and of course, the good guys win. What did you expect? On Dagobah, a little green man meets with Luke and R2D2. He is revealed to be Yoda. What I find cool is that Frank Oz has done the voice of Yoda for all of the Star Wars movies. You can tell that it's him in the Return of the Jedi because when he says ""When 900 years old you reach, looking good you will not be"" he sounds like Fozzie from the Muppets. Luke starts his training.Skipping a bit, the gang meets Lando Calrissian, the former owner of the Millennium Falcon. They all try to evade the Empire, but they realized that they've been tricked by Lando, who says that he had to join the bad guys to keep them from invading the city they're in. Luke is lured by his friends to the Empire and Darth Vader.Getting close to the intense part of the movie, they take Luke, Leia, and Han to a new place. Han gets frozen in carbonite. You'll see him like this in the next movie. When everyone leaves except for Luke and Darth Vader, the battle of all battles commences.As their fight ensues, they reach an area where if you fall, that is almost certainly your doom. Darth traps Luke and chops his lightsaber along with his right arm and they both fall down. Luke tells Darth that he killed his father.And then, the big twist............ are you ready? Here it is. After Luke says that here is what Darth says:""No, Luke. I am your father."" In my opinion, best twist they made back then. Naturally, Luke denies this. Darth offers Luke to join the Dark Side, but instead, like any crazy fool, he jumps. He calls to Leia, using the Force (foreshadowing? Maybe...) and he gets rescued. They look for Han, and the movie ends.How was that? Make your pick on which of the original ones was the best. I don't care, really. George Lucas is awesome. The movies are awesome. Watch and you won't be disappointed.","

","scott-sw","24 January 2008","Call me blasphemous, but cinematically, The Empire Strikes back is far superior to the original Star Wars. We pick up shortly after the destruction of the Death Star. The Empire has dispatched probe droids to find the rebels. One probot finds a base on the remote world of Hoth. Frustrated, the rebels must bug out. Commander Luke Skywalker and his flight team make their stand against giant AT-AT Walkers and Imperial Snow Stormtroopers. Meanwhile, Leia cannot get to her transport, so Han Solo must get her out on the Millennium Falcon. Darth Vader is obsessed with finding Skywalker so he wants the Falcon. He will stop at nothing--even asteroids. Vader tracks them to Bespin where Han hopes an old friend, Lando can help out. However, Vader beat them there and force Lando to turn them over. Luke ventures to Dagobah to meet Yoda, the Jedi Master. There he undergoes training to be a Jedi. As he learns to focus the Force, he has a vision of Han and Leia suffering in a city in the clouds. He leaves training prematurely to face Vader. He is not ready. And he learns of Vader's secret. Star Wars was an introduction and The Empire Strikes Back goes deeper. At the outset, we learn more about the Force and how it can help. It was only vaguely touched on in the first one. We also learn more of Vader's sinister side. In the first one, his presence and appearance exuded evil. In this one, he demonstrates it through dispatching the Empire officers who fail him. We also get to see Leia and Han grow closer. Their love blossoms and grows. They had real chemistry. Finally, Luke really grows. He is the impatient, naive, and adventurous boy. He suffers for his decision. This forces him to mature. While some people found Chewabaca's incessant howling over the fate of Han Solo, I found it touching, giving the great side-kick alien depth and soul. The magic of Star Wars is unmeasurable. It was great swashbuckling fun with age old themes of good triumphing over evil. It allowed us to escape and be struck with wonder and awe. Empire, though, is thoughtful, deep, analytical, and fun. The audience will identify with Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie all the more because of their suffering. At this point, they were no longer larger than life, but human. I compare this to falling in love. With Star Wars, the infatuation and lust begins. With Empire, the love deepens and becomes solid. If it never happened, the love would not mature. This is Lucas truly at his best. I hope he recaptures this someday.","

","Mustkillroy","29 May 2005","The best of the Star Wars series? Without a doubt. What makes this movie so great is the fact that it is not like other movies, leaving you with all the hope you need at the end. In this film, however, the only hope is that all of the main characters are still alive at the end.Another thing that places it above the others is its ending. The ""I am your father"" scene is no doubt the most famous single scene in film history, as well as one of the most shocking twists in any film ever made. Jones' delivery during the scene, as well as Hammil's reaction to it, only makes the scene better.And, of course, we can't forget the introduction of everyone's favorite Jedi master, Yoda. The jump he makes from strangely hilarious (""MINE! MINE!"") to calm and serious is very believable, unlike most films, where major jumps in personality are not believable at all. His unique speech is also interesting.In closing, one of the best films ever made. Thank you, George Lucas and Irvin Kershner, for bringing one of the best movies of all time.","

","JamesHunt18","22 July 2020","First of all, this is not just my all-time favourite sequel but my all-time favourite film. It thoroughly deserves that title because I consider it nothing less than a masterpiece. It takes everything great about the original and simply improves on it, a task many would've seemed to be impossible.With Irvin Kershner taking the reigns of director, from George Lucas, the film goes into a not necessarily darker tone but more mature. With A New Hope being a more light-hearted, but no less iconic, space opera this change puts more focus on the emotions of the characters we have met and, in turn, raises the stakes for heroes, especially Luke who must now face his foe.Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill maintain the effortless portrayal of their respective characters from the first film. The introduction of Billy Dee Williams as Lando is simply brilliant as he too fully embodies his role and bounces off Harrison Ford's Han Solo. Another introduction is that of Yoda (operated by Frank Oz) that adds to the mystery of 'The Jedi' and 'The Force' as this character is just overloaded with so much wisdom and is used so well to build Luke's character throughout the film.'Empire' contains possibly one of the most memorable line's in of all cinema; those who have seen this know exactly what I mean. However, it far from relies on this moment as there are a countless number of iconic moments and dialogue.The visual effects of the 1977 release of Star Wars may have been ground-breaking but this film shows how far the industry has come in 3 years. Whether this be the representation of Cloud City, the Walker Assault or even as simple as shots of the Falcon flying. These may seem easy enough to manufacture in 2020 but must have been incredible to see in 1980. I am simply gutted I wasn't able to experience that wonder myself.John Williams again excels at what he does. He is extra-ordinarily consistent in his quality, and not just in this franchise. He truly sends these films into the history books and is one of the many reasons Star Wars, Empire especially, is still so loved today.Empire Strikes Back is truly the heart of this trilogy and is unquestionable in its quality. The Story is unforgettable and the film-making is sublime. I only have two words for those involved in its production: Thank You!","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","gab-14712","18 October 2017","In 1977, a cultural revolution began with the little-known science-fiction film called Star Wars created by visionary director George Lucas. It ended up being the highest-grossing film of all-time and it still ranks very high in the midst of today's blockbusters. It was a very enjoyable movie and it created memorable characters that will live on for eternity. So of course we would get a sequel. In fact, Lucas created a whole world around his baby -an ambition that was not normal in 1980. With the sequel-The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas handed the directorial duties to his former college film professor Irvin Kershner because of his duties with his rising visual effects company Industrial Light and Magic, but of course he was very involved with this film. But enough of the background, let's talk about this film. This sequel is much darker in tone, more mysterious, and quite frankly the best film in the franchise. Our favorite characters like Luke and Leia Skywalker and Han Solo are back and we are introduced to more characters that are stored away in our hearts forever such as Yoda and Lando Calrissian. This is also the movie where we have the famous battle and reveal between Luke and Darth Vaderor shall I say between father and son, but more on that later.After the Rebels blow up the Death Star at the end of A New Hope, they hide away in the icy planet of Hoth. But the rebel base is soon discovered by Darth Vader (James Earl Jones and David Prowse) and the empire. From the battle that ensues, our characters are separated. Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) flee across the galaxy from the Empire. They end up going into Cloud City where they come across an old friend of Han's- Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Meanwhile, Luke (Mark Hamill) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) are sent to the abandoned planet of Dagobath where he continues his Jedi training with an old Jedi master named Yoda (Frank Oz). But will they stay forgotten for long with Darth Vader relentlessly pursuing Luke across the galaxy? One of the biggest improvements over the original film is the visuals. While the visuals in the 1977 film were good for its time period, George Luca's new production company really improved upon the visuals. Along with the visuals, the film has strong production design and character design. I loved the look of Yoda, which was a puppet of course. You can tell the visuals were strong for a variety of reasons. There were the sights of the majestic Imperial Walkers during the battle of Hoth, the hairy sloth creature that attacks Luke after he gets lost on Hoth, the creepy, dense look of Dagobath, the spiral towers of Cloud City, and of course that lightsaber battle between Luke and Vader.SPOILER!! My highlight out of many of them is the revelation that happens near the end of the movie in Cloud City. I am sure most of you have seen the movie but if not, read no further. Darth Vader reveals to Luke during their intense duel that he is Luke's father, Anakin. Of course in the process, Vader chops of Luke's hand and he falls through a chute but is saved from falling to his death thanks to the Millennium Falcon. Also, the movie ends with Han Solo being captured by the Empire and frozen solid. So these events are just some of the reasons why this film is darker and more sinister than the space opera feel of the first film.The acting remains a strong point in the movie. Harrison Ford is excellent as always. I loved his ""wounded ego"" attitude and his bantering with Chewbacca added some lightheartedness to the movie. Yoda is my favorite new character. Not only did they want a realistic puppet, they actually wanted a good actor to bring that puppet to life. And Frank Oz did just that. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher remain excellent in their respective roles as Luke and Leia. And the voice of James Earl Jones? Well, the same magic that it always created! Need I say more? Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back is my favorite Star Wars movie, and frankly one of the best sci-fi films of all time. It really expanded upon the mystery and the lore the first film provided. The film explores its mythology in darker tones and that added depth and humanity to our characters. Lawrence Kasdan's and Leigh Brackett's screenplay took Lucas's world and created something that was evolutionary and breath-taking while staying true to its roots. The film ended on a sinister cliffhanger, so you bet we will be seeing a third film. The story and the visuals are fantastic, and now you can see why this is my favorite Star Wars film.My Grade: A+ ""No, I am your father!"" (Vader to Luke) ""Try not, Do, or do not!"" (Yoda to Luke)","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","sharky_55","25 November 2015","Empire Strikes Back took everything that was revolutionary from Star Wars and improved it, and then some. It is deeper, more mature, and asks more questions of the world. R2D2 and Chewbacca, who became lovable fan favourites from the moment they hit the screen in 1977, did so without speaking a single word, but here they are much more than just accessories to the plot. In their grunts and roars and beeps, they now became beacons of loyalty for our group. The iconic opening crawl speaks of the events in between the two films - a time skip has occurred and the rebels are in hiding. The strengths of the characterisations show us exactly what has happened in these months unseen; Luke has become a respected fighter and commander, Han a captain, and his bickering and romantic tension with Leia only growing stronger (and which results in one of the most iconic confessions of love of all time). We see the bonds of friendship so much stronger in this sequel, and as Chewie attempts to repair CP3O and carries him around like a backpack, we recognise this is as an emotion of universality. No wonder Lucas used it again with Luke and Yoda. Fox had placed little faith in the original, and the budget had been constricted, and Lucas's vision mellowed. But after the immense popularity and success, ESB was given full backing. The world of Star Wars was now even more fully realised. We had visited the deserts of Tattoine, the Aztec pyramids rebel bases amidst jungle territory, and now the icy planets of Hoth, where an imperial assault is imminent. The battlefield was now much clearer and the greenscreen backdrops of the dogfight-style fighter pilots more detailed, more immersive - fellow rebel ground fighters, jets and Imperial assault crews now milled around in the background, and live explosions proved to be more threatening than the multicoloured digital explosions in the black of space. There was real weight and fluidity in the way that the X-Wings would speed in and out and under and over the AT-ATs, and the coverage now provided a greater and more epic scale of the action; see Luke run around the legs and dangle from the elephant- like robotic beast, and how the Millennium Falcon weaves around an entirely three dimensional asteroid field and narrowly escapes from a gigantic space slug. We have more new developments. Besides the stop-motion photography of the AT-ATs, which creates an oddly appropriate jerky walking motion, we also have the puppetry of the endearing Tauntauns which amble about in the snow, and their models are amazingly detailed, head to claw in a thick frost-covered hair, a dragon-shaped head and curved horns. And there is the old Jedi Master Yoda, whom I am conflicted on; at times it remains painfully obvious that he is a puppet, whose mouth does not correspond to the truths that he speaks, but they are great and important truths that become even more evident once Luke encounters the foreshadowing of himself in a Vader helmet. And of course the matte paintings are once again immaculate and beautifully detailed; in particular the landing platform on the edge of the Cloud City, and the glorious Bespin itself, bathed in the pink glow of the sunset and clouds. As the Falcon soars away above the sunset, Williams' Cloud City orchestral theme is at its most stirring, and is the second most iconic in the soundtrack, right after (what else?) The Imperial March. Never has a trumpet fanfare been so menacing and so recognisable - also named Darth Vader's Theme because the mere sighting of it signalled his presence and power. Vader is photographed more ingeniously than in Star Wars (in brightly lit exteriors) and this enhances his terrifying persona; giving instructions from his own personal capsule, force-choking over the communications channel, emerging from icy mist in the freezing tunnels of Hoth, slivers of light hitting his mask and creating a dark and shiny gleam, and in that climatic duel between father and son, both are silhouetted on the orange steps by the smoking vents, and the colours of the shimmering lightsabers tell us all that we need to know about their allegiances. This is one of the classic movie villains at his peak, but it is more than black and white (or blue and red) morality - there is just a hint of fatherly affection behind that mask, buried deep below, but we see the inklings of a plan, tinges of regret that have formed over the years living in the Dark Side. And in Luke's horrified reaction, the realisation that his own vices may well lead him down the same path. The studio was not entirely happy about leaving Vader in his tumbling TIE fighter after the explosion of the first Death Star; sequels were regarded as pulpy cash-ins rather than significant narratives. But Empire proves its worth, and then some - it ends with Vader's cruel blow and confession, the loss of a hand, and the capture of a beloved character...but there is still a glimmer of hope. It remains one of the remarkable sci-fi achievements.","

I am not from USA, I am from Croatia. And I can guarantee you most of the adults who heard that understood the reference. That alone should tell you how much this movie is beloved and immortalized in popular culture. Even though the first movie was a giant success, this didn't mean making the sequel was easy. There were, again, problems with the budget and with filming and editing, but, in the end, we still received an amazing movie due to imagination of George Lucas and the talent of the people working on the movie! This time, the plot is faster, more focused and darker than in the first movie, but the whole thing is still very entertaining and fills you with warmth only movies made with a lot of effort, care and love put into them can. Basically, if you weren't won over by the first movie, there's nothing here to change your mind for the worse and you can only be impressed. But if you didn't like these movies in the first place, you wouldn't be reading this random review from some guy from Croatia, yet here you are, waiting for some random stranger to praise this movie for bazzilionth time. And don't worry, I will! ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is, same as the first movie, a timeless masterpiece that offers an entertaining and emotional adventure full of wonder, fun and action, which will be enjoyed by all future generations of science fiction fans! 10/10! Watch it, enjoy it and thank God, George Lucas, Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and everyone else who worked on it! Thank you for making our lives better by letting us experience this saga! May the force be with you, wherever you are!","

","bkoganbing","24 September 2010","Though the intrepid three heroes of Star Wars destroyed the Death Star commanded by Darth Vader, the rebel army is still on the run. They've taken refuge in a frozen planet called Hoth much like George Washington and the Continental Army at Valley Forge. In the meantime the Empire still searches for the rebel army in The Empire Strikes Back.When the attack comes, it comes full force, the rebels flee as do Luke Skywalker and R2D2 in one ship and Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca and C3PO. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker is given a mission in a dream by the late Alec Guinness, killed in the first Star Wars film to receive Jedi Knight Advanced Training from the legendary Yoda and he seeks him out. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher and company seek out Ford's old friend Lando Kalrissian to repair his ship after Ford plays a dangerous cat and mouse game with Darth Vader's battle cruiser.As Lando Kalrissian, Billy Dee Williams steps into the Star Wars pantheon of heroes and proves quite useful if not quite on the up and up. George Lucas continues his tradition of writing about futuristic Homeric like heroes in a galaxy far away. And as cinema, The Empire Strikes Back continues the quality of excellence that the original set. Looks like the Force is definitely with George Lucas.","

","Jackie-Kennedy","7 February 2007","This film, the second of George Lucas' incredible Saga, not only expands on the first and improves upon it in many ways but it also proves that a film can be a huge success without having a true beginning or end. Rather The Empire Strikes Back is but another chapter in the enduring tale begun by a New Hope.But it has enough witty dialog, amazing action sequences and brilliant new characters to make it a wonderful film in its own right as well.We pick up the story on the remote island of Hoth where the Rebel Alliance has established a base beneath the snow. The Galatic Empire is hot on their tale as Darth Vadar continues his obsessive search for young Luke Skywalker, in whom he has sensed a strength beyond any he himself possesses. Luke meanwhile sets out on his own voyage to the swamps of Dagobah in search of the famed Jedi Master Yoda to train as a Jedi.In order to help the story along Lucas introduces a range of new and interesting characters. A new villain emerges in the form of the cold hearted calculating Bounty Hunter Boba Fett hired by Vadar to find Skywalker. Fett has his own agenda too. He is being payed by Jabba the Hutt to capture Han Solo from whom Jabba is owed a dept. Another ally is also to be found in Lando Clarissian , smooth talking Administrator of Cloud City mining colony. A gambler, smuggler and old friend of Han he has entered into a tenuous deal with Vadar to protect his city but in the process must betray his old friend to the Empire.Perhaps the most iconic and best loved of all the characters is not a human at all but a small green puppet who likes talking backwards. Jedi Master Yoda is by far the most entertaining non-human character and is a perfect mix humor, mystery and wisdomThis film is much darker and action packed then the first with battles on Hoth and the desperate feeling from the Imperial Fleet of the Millennium Falcon. There is drama coming at you from all angles as Han Solo taken prisoner by Boba Fett in the most cruel manner and Vadar conspires to turn Luke to the Dark Side.We see a crueler, more selfish and sadistic side to Vader than before which adds to the tension.Here also the ultimate man-to-man combat as Luke Skywalker comes face to face with Darth Vadar and learns in the process a terrible truth about his Father leading to perhaps the most famous quote in Cinematic history.There is also a little romance thrown into the mix as Han and Leia's relationship develops.The Empire Strikes Back has some of the wittiest lines in the entire Saga. Such memorable quotes as "" Laugh it up fuzzball!"" and "" He is clumsy as he is stupid"" when heard in context show the skill of Lucas as scriptwriter. Special Effects beggar belief has giant four-legged walking robots are felled by fighter planes and Imperial Destroyers chase the Millennium Falcon across the Galaxy. Clearly this film is George and Co at full artistic strength.For a film with no beginning and and no end The Empire Strikes Back is a masterpiece.It continues the Saga in a believable and captivating way and succeeds in leaving the audience gagging for more as we hope and pray Han will survive, will Luke not to give up on his path and be turned to the Dark Side and wonder how the rebels will recover from the blows dealt them by the Empire .","

","Animany94","18 January 2019","I can't say anything new to this massive spectacle of a movie. Everything has already been said, but I can share my personal expirience with you and it was epic, grand, exciting and every positive adjective you could think of!For too long I had gone without watching the original Star Wars trilogy, because reasons unknown, but when I finally sat down and put it on so much felt familiar. Not in a bad way, because I see it like it has made such a huge impact on pop culture that everybody knows Darth Vader is and qoutes the movie's lines and so much more! I hadn't seen it as I said, but it still felt exciting watching every move they made and listening to the magnificent score by John Williams! The big reveal was still epic even though I knew it from people talking about it and saying the famous line.The story structure and the surprise reveal of something to completely change our hero's view on everything he thought he knew has been done so many times after The Empire Strikes Back wrecked theaters and became a phenomenon, so it definitely is the most impactful of all Star Wars films.Everyone tries to make a phenomenal movie, but only few ends up like The Empire Strikes Back!","

","LigerTamer100","28 December 2020","Forty years ago, in a galaxy far away. A sequel of the movie that changed cinema forever was made, and it sure as heck didn't failed on anyone.Every top best sequels I see always has Empire Strikes Back on the number one spot, and there's a reason why. It took many dark turns that nobody at the time saw coming, it didn't use the same elements that the previous movie used and it felt like we were exploring the galaxy a lot more than we did in the last film.If I have to pick where to put this on my Star Wars rank list, it'd be on the top three, just not sure where in the three spots.The romance part of the film works really well with Leia and Han. Sure, the age gap between Carrie and Harrison was a bit awkward, but they somehow made it work great for the franchise and became one of the best couples ever.The reveal of Vader being the father wasn't a surprise to me when I first watched it, because I started watching the franchise with the prequels first in 2006 and knew what was happening.And I know this is going to cause a debate, but I think Yoda is a Muppet. It's not because of Frank Oz performing him, but it's because he feels like one to me. I feel like the Jim Henson company helped a little bit making him and there was an episode of Muppet Show where Luke, Chewie, R2 and 3PO was in and to me, that was a deal that Lucas and Henson made as a fair enough collab as a team. There's even some behind the scenes pictures that Jim, Kermit and Piggy were in. Think about that for a few minutes.This is without a doubt, one of the best sequels that was ever made and will always be forever. The force has always been strong with the franchise and fandom, and will forever more.","

","chera_khalid","2 October 2023","The Empire Strikes Back, a vintage jewel in the Star Wars galaxy that had me navigating the asteroid field of nostalgia with a grin. The acting, led by the charismatic trio of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher, is a lightsaber duel of emotions. Film editing propels the narrative at lightspeed, seamlessly transitioning between Hoth's icy plains and the swamps of Dagobah. The strength lies in the darker, more mature tone, expanding the saga beyond the binary of good and evil. Weaknesses? The romantic subplot might be as clunky as C-3PO on an Ewok dance floor, but it's a minor quibble in the grand scheme. The music, John Williams' masterpiece, is the Force that binds the scenes together, from the Imperial March to Yoda's Theme. Cinematography captures the vastness of space and the intimacy of lightsaber duels, creating a visual odyssey through the galaxy. The message? A tale of loss, redemption, and the resilience of hope in the face of Imperial tyranny. 7/10 is a blast from the past that still holds its intergalactic charm, a Star Wars episode that's both iconic and imperfect, like an old friend you're happy to revisit.","

","Zac_La_Porte","22 October 2021","The momentum throughout the largely-adored Star Wars instalment isn't exactly energetic enough to win against A New Hope. So overall, it's a very well-constructed sequel that continues with the epic sci-fi action, but is mainly disappointing.The new director, Irvin Kershner, definitely builds onto George Lucas's original and clever direction. The force, the explosive effects, the appealing battles and the cool robots are all brought back, except they're not as fascinating this time... The real flaw is the exceedingly unhurried pace, and it manages to coat all the creativity.Although The Empire Strikes Back leaves off with a reasonably satisfying touch, it fails to leave you excited for the next movie. It's a likeable flick worth experiencing in the cinema, but it's adored a little too highly. But still, there's absolutely no doubt that the big fans of the series will love it.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","alekspredator87","21 July 2022","""New Hope"" showed the whole world that fiction can be adventurous, fun, and new worlds, as George Lucas showed, need further disclosure. A new film was needed that would continue the story of the confrontation between a small army of rebels and an unshakable and gloomy Empire led by Darth Vader. The fans got such a movie.The very title reveals the essence of the upcoming conflict. The Empire and its Death Star had suffered a crushing defeat, which meant that a retaliatory strike was needed, a step that would make the rebels lose. And this film perfectly demonstrates how the stakes are rising in this legendary confrontation.The main characters have matured noticeably, they have grown up, become more serious. Their characters are perfectly shown in the events that surround them. It seems that the actions in the previous movie were like a starting point. Now each of the heroes chooses his own unique path. Luke Skywalker, as the main character, decides to become what he did not think a few years ago - a Jedi, a warrior of light, who once and for all must defeat evil in the person of Vader and Emperor Sidious, who is still flashing in the background. Obi-Wan Kenobi's self-sacrifice seems to have made him an adult overnight, made him feel indebted to this old teacher. And then Luke accepts this burden of fate, intending to fight to the last.Leia Organa and Han Solo are testing the strength of their fragile relationship so far, they do not want to give in to each other. All this happens against the background of the struggle with the imperial armies and a series of betrayals, when it turns out that friends can no longer be trusted. In the maelstrom of events, news comes under the finale, which is now fashionable to call a ""twist"". This is an event that turns out unexpectedly, something that turns the whole narrative upside down or vice versa. The history of Star Wars was probably one of the first to show this technique in the cinema. This is remembered for many years, and the play of the actors (those who saw it will understand which actor and what situation I'm talking about) amazes with its sincerity and literally makes the audience tremble from the discovery that happened.However, this seemingly gloomy picture is not devoid of positive interesting moments. Huge Wookiees, droids and ridiculous situations allow you to dilute this tragic story of one family.The creators of the picture skillfully use the technologies available at that time, which enable viewers to see and, most importantly, believe in the reality of those worlds that are shown to us on the screen. All this is flavored with excellent dialogues, colorful characters and a wonderful musical component. What the Imperial March that appeared here is worth, which for decades will become the personification of the yoke of evil, the approaching dangerous Darth Vader.The creators perfectly show several storylines and interactions between the characters at once. There is a love relationship, and the relationship between mentor and student, a test of friendly feelings. And each of the lines is successfully woven into the overall plot, makes you empathize and see yourself in these diverse characters, understand their motives, agree or not with their opinion.""The Empire strikes back"" makes it possible to leave our native Land and go on an unprecedented journey, makes you throw away your earthly experiences, understand how much brighter and more dynamic life can be, because it is in a galaxy far, far away, where events happened a long time ago. Cinema will allow you to ask a lot of questions about the meaning of life, about relationships, about the world, which is not only black and white. The world is multifaceted, with its own complexities and ambiguity. And, most importantly, this film will encourage you to see the next one, the one that will complete the classic trilogy and finally put all the dots on the ""E"" for these heroes.9 out of 10.","

","rorymacveigh-66661","27 March 2015","Although Star Wars Episode IV was groundbreaking, as a kid I always loved to see Star Wars Episode V, as basically it took all the things developed in the first movie, and built on them to create something 1,000 times better like a good sequel should, rather than just retracing the steps of the previous film. Although my family didn't own Episode V, my brother's friend did, and surprised me when I was about 6 years old by bringing over Episode V in secret, and I adored every last minute of it!So what's the deal? After the destruction of the Death Star in the previous film, the Empire gained its revenge, and the Rebel Alliance was scattered across the Galaxy in a bitter chase. Now on the ice planet of Hoth, Jedi Luke Skywalker is told in a vision to go to the planet of Dagobah to learn from a mystical Jedi Master known as Yoda. Meanwhile, the Empire determines their location, and after a vicious fight between the ill-equipped Rebels and the Empire's AT-AT Walkers, the group must flee the planet, with Han Solo and Chewbacca taking Princess Leia and C-3PO in a desperate bid to escape the Imperial blockade aboard the Millennium Falcon, whilst Luke and R2D2 journey to the swamp world of Dagobah to find the mysterious Jedi, all while being pursued by the vengeful Dark Lord, Darth Vader, obsessed with turning Luke to the Dark Side.As I said, rather than retreading the first movie like many sequels do, the Empire Strikes Back takes all the elements from the first movie, the fantastic models, the gripping action, the story, the characters, and expands on them. The development of the characters, such as romantic relationship that you can genuinely believe between Han and the Princess is established, Luke is trained in the art of a Jedi, being able to control and channel the Force, and Darth Vader's truly evil powers are built upon, now being a ruthless leader of a frightened Army.The story is also one that throws you on so many loops. I've watched this movie a million times so nothing surprises me, but if you're watching for the first time, there are many things about this film that will give you a shock, or take you by surprise. I of course wont name them, but you'll see what I mean.The action sequences have also been massively improved since the last movie. Whilst the battle above the Death Star, though long, was impressive, the battle against the AT-AT's in the snow with the stop-motion movement of the Walkers and the fight of the Snowspeeders is just so good it's practically real. Every individual piece is manipulated and choreographed to perfection to create a truly awesome fight scene. The lightsaber battles too have been made more energetic, and take place on a wider range of locations, as well as the mastery of the Force and powers that it entails being developed heavily.Overall, I consider this both my best Science-Fiction film, but also my best film of all time. A film that even today has me hooked, and continues to be the awe and inspiration of so many even 35 years after it first hit the big screen. I recommend this movie to everyone, because it appeals to just about everyone!","

","hitchcockthelegend","29 March 2009","Luke, Leia and Han are fighting with the rebels in the hope of defeating the Imperial forces. But Luke gets a calling to the planet Dagobah, where under the tutelage of Jedi Master, Yoda, he hopes to become a Jedi himself, but that also brings him closer to his, and Leia's, destiny.Lets tell it as it is, The Empire Strikes Back is a better film than Star Wars, not as impacting of course, but most definitely better. Technically, in story telling and in tone, it holds up well today and certainly warrants the amount of times it crops up in best sequels debates. That it's not actually a sequel is irrelevant, it is of course the filler in a wonderful sci-fi sandwich, because as second instalments go, Empire has few peers. With Empire Strikes Back we get all the whizz bang adventure strewn heart of Star Wars, but George Lucas (stepping aside for Irvin Kershner to direct) has also fleshed the story out with a serious dark tone that oddly becomes a bedfellow to the romantic fun on offer, where new and engaging characters (and creatures) add spice to this wonderful fantastical broth.Aided by the considerable writing talent of Leigh Brackett (The Long Goodbye, Rio Bravo, The Big Sleep), Lucas took the bold and ingenious step of giving the bad guys the upper hand, in fact it could be argued that he was taking a considerable risk with his ending. Forcing his viewers to wait for the final chapter (three years later), after tantalisingly setting us up with a corker of plot twist (one which is still to this day as potent as it was back on release), Lucas pulled perhaps one of the cheekiest carrot dangles in cinema history.Though more famed for its dark undertones, Empire is for sure still a very fun movie, C3PO goes into camp overdrive and Han Solo ups his quip quota by some margin. Then of course there is Yoda, in himself a comedic joy. The action sequences beg for repeat viewings, a battle on the ice laden planet Hoth is a marvel and the choreography for Skywalker's fight with Darth Vader is out of the top draw. But ultimately it's with the dark side that the picture excels. Complex and amazingly posing moral quandary's, The Empire Strikes Back is quite an experience, one that will forever hold up to repeat viewings for this particular viewer. 10/10","

","Theo Robertson","20 July 2013","A conjunction is a word linking two sentences . A couple of examples of a conjunction is "" and "" and "" also "" so when I say THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a good film then I also have to use the conjunction "" but "" in case I suffer an internet disembowelment on the grounds of blasphemy or heresy Two things the film does well is spectacle and character interaction . The film gets off to a great start where the rebel forces on the Planet Hoth have to fight a battle against The Imperial Empire who are attacking the base using giant robotic camels . That alone makes it worth seeing and we get some smart liners between Han Solo and Princess lela and we get some smooth patter from Lando who gives a masterclass in how to impress a woman But ( There's always a conjunction ) most of the spectacle is confined to the first half of the film and after that the story concentrates on all the spiritual nonsense involving the force between Yoda and Luke Skywalker . Some people may be surprised that Mark Hamill's career as a movie star didn't take off but one wonders why he was cast in the franchise in the first place since he makes a rather wet unlikely hero rather than the youthful everyman the role is written as . Watching Hamill try and carry his scenes shows how unimpressive he is and how good the rest of the cast are in comparison THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a good Summer blockbuster but the brutal truth is that it's no more than that . It was made in an era before CGI dominated spectacular FX driven films at the turn of the century and that alone makes it worth seeing even if the most impressive scenes happen in the first half . But ( There's always a conjunction ) it's ridiculous the film is so highly rated on this site's top 250 movies and at best probably belongs in the lower reaches of the chart","

The story is more involved, it carries the story arcs from the first one over flawlessly.  The Battle of Hoth is amazing to watch, as is the asteroid chase.  Luke begins his training as a Jedi and we see in the tree that he is going the way of Vader.  Han and Leia squabble but they slowly start to warm up to each other in a classic scene of love finding its way through dialogue that never mentions their love for each other.  Yoda's philosophy of ""do or do not.""  are words to live by.  Throw in the smooth talking Lando and a light saber duel that is truly exciting and you got yourself one hell of a follow up to one of the greatest films of all time. All that and finding out that Darth Vader is Luke's father!","

Overall, a brilliant movie that really builds on where the last movie left off and improves on it in so many ways to make it a very memorable film that is not only the best in the series but in film history as we see a more mature Star Wars in the characters that take part in it.Great Direction (The actual moving of the story and making sure all pieces come together is incredible managed and executed, and this movie is a definite improvement in directing people than its predecessor as the director was really able to get more out of his actors in their performances for this time around), Very Good to Great Acting (Very Good from the Live-Action Cast; Great from the Vocal/Costumed-Characters) (Very Good from Mark Hamill (showed the progress he has made from being a naive/hopeful kid to someone more cognizant of the present and the work he needs to put in to be a better Jedi), Great from Harrison Ford (the real star of the show in all his scenes as he smooth/cool nature really helps show how great of a character Han Solo really is (and he really cleaned up the delivery of his lines in this movie as there are not any awkward pauses as there were last time), Good to Very Good from Carrie Fisher (She really improves this time around as she is given more freedom to play as opposed to last time; she also really grows as a character from being the damsel in distress to being a loving leader), Good to Very Good from Billy Dee Williams (Really becomes a memorable presence in all the scenes he is in with his cool nature that conflicts/competes with Han, though there is some hiccups in delivery as he is still getting used to the Star Wars universe as opposed to the other members of the cast), Very Good from Anthony Daniels (really brings C-3PO to life as he tries to help but panics in not knowing how much he can (the anxious nerd-savior trope); also, plays a great role in helping vocalize the relationship and friendship he has with R2-D2), Incredible from James Earl Jones/David Prowse (created one of the most iconic voices in pop-culture as his menacing voice and performance showed why Darth Vader is a villain to be scared of), Incredible from Kenny Baker (Really brings R2 to life through the difference mannerisms the character has in sort of a comedic relief yet important way (making R2 one of the best characters in all of Star Wars); also, helps bring the flare that makes the character's friendship with C-3PO one of the best in pop-culture), Very Good from Peter Mayhew (Played the adorable, yet extremely dangerous Chewie and played off his co-star very nicely, similar to the R2/C-3PO relationship; and really grows the character to show how loving he is towards his new friends), Great to Incredible from Frank Oz (Really brought the character of Yoda to life with the puppeteering and the vocal performance, Good to Very Good from the rest of the Live-Action cast; Very Good from the rest of the Vocal/Costumed-Characters cast), Incredible Story (Really sets up different elements of the universe very nicely and uses the concept of parallel storylines very well; also has some of the most iconic moments of the series and does a good job in building the downfall of the characters; the only issue this time around is that it does not have the ability to build worlds like the previous film could), Great Screenplay (The dialogue this time around felt way more natural and was better written; the screenplay still shines is the foreshadowing to future Star Wars events, symbolism, iconic lines (with it having one of the most iconic lines/plot twists in cinema (or even narrative) history)), Brilliant Score (Takes what was great from the previous film and adds some new themes that really make this score stand out as well), Great to Incredible Cinematography (Which really stands out in the Luke vs. Vader scene), Very Good Sound (Especially when giving the movie a space/science-fiction feel as well as bringing the sounds of the droids (especially R2-D2) to life, but there are some issues with Sound in this movie as there feels like a delayed sound with the lightsabers (which is very annoying if you have watched the prequels)), Very Good to Great Editing, Very Good Visual Effects (This movie does not really go overboard with the new visuals of the re-release as much as the other movies so it is easier to comment on), Incredible to Brilliant Production Design (Created some very iconic sets that are well remembered in history, and really added to that with the Hoth/Dagobah/Bespin sets which are regarded as some of the best in all of Star Wars), Incredible Makeup (Helped bring to life aliens that are not from this world), Incredible Costumes (Created some of the most iconic outfits in pop-culture history, with the Darth Vader costume being one of the most well remembered in any historical context), Plot Structure was very well written as it has three major parallel story lines that all converge to the climax and the end (something that helps keep the audience engaged to see how the different arcs are coming along), Pacing was better in this movie as it felt more consistent and not as slow as the last one, Build to climax is done very nicely as it is really pivots the franchise into seeing who these characters really are as they have to make important decisions for the future; Climax was the best part of the movie as we get to see what Luke's training has come to/seeing the rest of the crew into action as we get to see how much the characters have grown yet see how far they really are to their goals in the sage; moreover one of the most important lines in history is delivered in this climax that make Star Wars a franchise memorable, Tone does not play as much into the space opera or science fiction epic as the last one but does have shades of it; feels more like a standout movie that really transcends genre in many ways (while still keeping the same star wars charm), Really can be felt of as a stand alone movie (even though it leaves so much to be answered with its ending) as we get to see the rise and fall of the characters as they must continue their own individual quests to grow as characters.","

","kenjha","12 October 2007","The second ""Star Wars"" film to be released has non-stop action, but the problem is that there is no compelling plot to make the action interesting. Endless shots of star ships gliding through space soon become tedious. The last third of the movie does generate some interest but it's too little, too late to save this from being more than a mediocre entry in the series. The other problem is that it just stops abruptly, relying too much on the sequel to clean up the loose ends. The dialog is amateurish and there is too much emphasis on special effects. Yoda is cute but Chewbacca and R2-D2 become increasingly annoying with the silly noises they make.","

","moronicfables","13 November 2004","Back in the 80's, people were very excited for the release of The Empire Strikes Back, the much-awaited sequel to the phenomenal Star Wars. But, I can imagine, they were also wondering if it would be as good as Star Wars. No, it's not. It's much better. There's more action, the characters become richer and we are introduced to new ones. Thankfully, Lucas backed down in directing and/or writing the film. Considered as the best film among the Trilogy, The Empire Strikes Back starts with the whole gang staying at a Rebel base in the ice planet of Hoth. After almost getting mauled by a Wampa Beast, Luke gets a message from Obi-Wan Kenobi to go to the Planet of Dagobah and look for a Jedi Master named Yoda. The Imperial Army arrives and tries to destroy the base, but the Rebels have already escaped, with Luke accompanied by R2-D2 goes to Dagobah. The Battle of Hoth is easily my favorite action scene in the whole Trilogy.While Han, Leia and Chewbacca are hiding from the Imperial army that's chasing them, Luke meets the 800 year-old Jedi Master Yoda. Full of wisdom and a funny way of talking, Yoda trains Luke to be a real Jedi and teaches him the ways of a Jedi. Almost nothing happens in the middle of the film, except for great character development and lots of intelligent dialogue. It manages to keep us interested and excited without having too many action scenes. We get to know more about all the characters, including the villains and new characters that we are introduced to.We then meet Lando Calrissian who lives in Bespin, a city that floats among the clouds. Lucas hardly touched this masterpiece, but he still added some more striking visuals, most of which aren't unnecessary. More windows are added to the buildings in Bespin, adding lot more light and life to the settings. The visuals added aren't a bother anymore, and for once probably made a scene look better. Han and Leia don't trust Lando, to which we soon find out that they were right about their feelings toward him. Luke forsees that they're in trouble and goes to make sure that they're all right. As Han Solo is about to be frozen, Leia finally admits to Han that she loves her. To which Han replies with, ""I know."" It's an incredibly touching and emotional scene, where things are just about to get worse.As Luke arrives at Bespin, he encounters Darth Vader, to which father and son fight. Quite possibly the best Lightsaber fight in all the Star Wars films, the scene is filled with so much emotion and a shocking revelation. Luke sacrifices his own life rather than join the dark side, and is saved by Leia and Chewbacca, along with Lando, after much threats from Chewy. The film ends on such a downbeat note, keeping a cliffhanger for the final movie in the Trilogy. The characters have yet to face another adventure, and learn more from each other as the Imperial is yet to be beaten and Solo to be rescued. It's not a happy ending, or should I say, a beginning for the characters as what the future holds from them is yet to be known. It shouldn't be a suprrise from anyone that The Empire Strikes Back is considered by many as the best of the Trilogy, because the film is a great stepping-stone for the characters we've grown to love in the first film and introduces us to new ones that we easily grow to love and care for. That's what makes Star Wars a great Trilogy in the first place: it's the characters we remember. Not the visuals.10","

Not just a great movie but an amazing sequel. Filled a great cast of Heroes and Villains. The effects 45 years later are still pretty amazing with amazing sets and puppetry work by Frank Oz, an amazing opening scene with tons of action and an ending that ends bitter sweet yet somber. Not to mention one of the best movie twist in history, with of course the only huge issue with the twist is even non Star Wars fans know what it is due to pop culture but that's basically a testament to how great it is.","

","Joseph_Sarries","7 April 2022","I am a major fan of the Star Wars universe. But this film, in my opinion, takes the cake as one of, if not, the best Star Wars film of the franchise, especially of the OG trilogy. I love the conflict with Luke and his destiny, how he is all for training, and completely obedient to his master. But at the same time, he is so willing to leave it to help his friends and the rebellion, despite the words of Master Yoda and Obi-Wan. It almost seems like he will abandon it for them, which both shows his loyalty and stubborness. And this episode, even without an 'actual ending', begins to foreshadow Luke's battle with himself and the dark side for the next episode. All-in-all, the amazing story combined with the great visuals for its time is a very good film, and remains my favorite.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","xxxxxxxxstarwarsxxxxxxxx","10 August 2022","Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, or as some might call it ""Empire"" is widely considered to be one of the greatest film sequels of all time. Following up from the original Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back continues the saga with what is the second film of the trilogy. From repeatedly re-watching it over the years, it's come to my attention that Empire is very different in comparison to the rest of the films. Sure it has its humor and all, but overall it's much more dramatic. My favorite films are those that depict the story before it has been shown, and the title alone, clearly foreshadows what's to expect in this film. It reveals a tragedy in which we see the first glimpse of victory for the Galactic Empire since the fall of the dreaded Death Star.If there's one thing I've noticed with Empire, it's that it's more of a 'darker' film that is particularly shown through the perspective of Darth Vader. After only 8 minutes of screen time in Star Wars, Empire has really given us the chance to delve into his backstory, and really understand more about the mysterious figure behind the mask. I say figure because he has no formal identity, and we as the audience are given the challenge of making our own assumptions. As we've come to expect, Darth Vader is intriguingly more involved during this installment, as his intimidating demeanor continues to shroud our interpretation of the character, and his relationships with other characters, in particular Luke, which is quite the treat and one of the most captivating moments of the whole film. They really couldn't have selected a better, more talented actor than James Earl Jones, who I feel doesn't receive as much recognition for the role than he deserves. With all due respect to the great David Prowse who did great in the suit, Jones truly enlightens the character. His voice is really special, and a lot of aspiring actors look up to him.Throughout the film we also explore the relationship between Leia and Han and how their story becomes a core part of this film, and the introduction to so many new and loving characters such as Lando and Yoda, including countless planets which continue to expand. Of course, I can't write a review without the mentioning of John Williams. What a wonderful job once again with the classic score of this film, which I would say is better than the first score. Its truly amazing how music can create such emotion so powerful that only the goosebumps on my arms can describe it. There is simply not enough words in the vocabulary that can truly capture its meaning. Not to mention the people working at ILM. They are the magicians in film. Film is visual effects, the two interconnect with each other, and without the visuals there is no film, and the visual effects have significantly improved since the first film and are truly spectacular - a work of art, that really immerses you into the experience.There are so many more people to appreciate, during the making of this film, none more than George Lucas of course, but also Irvin Kershner. He has incredible vision. His level of passion for the franchise and the way in which he interpreted the film has won me over, to the point in which I would argue, Empire is the greatest film of the trilogy and the franchise, and that is not an easy feat to accomplish. Empire has laid foundations for future movie sequels in which many of them follow that same formula.Compelling narratives, dark tone, deep character developments, Empire has it all. I like it when films 'strangle you', you know really keep you into it, and Empire has done just that. There is no other film (apart from the first film) that has had such a profound impact on my life, and I'll forever appreciate the pioneers behind the scenes. It is a film of the ages, and a must watch. There is so much more to say about this film, but the rest is for you for you decide. 5/5!!!","

","dormesher-21565","30 August 2021","Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back. Another Masterpiece in the Star Wars Universe and this is definitely my favourite in the franchise and is definitely the best story they told.The opening to this movie is fantastic and the opening battle on Hoth is a great scene and great to watch AT-AT Walkers looks amazing and the effects still hold up to this day.Luke is amazing in this one and has now had some training to become a Jedi its so interesting seeing his journey in these films and he's one amazing character. He also goes to Dagabah in this one to meet Yoda and get some more training and love the scenes on Dagabah.We also meet some characters like Lando and Boba Fett two of the most iconic characters in the franchise. The scenes on Cloud City are fantasic and the betrayel by Lando is both shocking and interesting and the fact that he learns from it and becomes one's of the good guys is awesome.And I love how the whole Cloud City is to get Luke there in a trap and the fight Luke and Vader is fantasic and the reveal that Vader is Lukes Father is still one of the greatest scenes in film history.My favourite moment in the movie is my favourite moment in Star Wars when Yoda gets the X Wing out of the Swamp the music is amazing and I love how Yoda shows Luke that size dosent matter the force is the force and when your strong with you can accomplish great things. ""do or do not there is no try"". Such an amazing scene I've always loved it.Verdict 10/10 a Masterpiece of a movie and my favourite in the star wars saga everything about this movie is fantasic the music the action the story and to end it on a cliffhanger was amazing.","

But that doesn't bring down the fact that it's one of the best sequels of all time and of my personal favorite star wars movies, everything that happens after this revolves around the twist in this movie, and then they made the prequels and revenge of the sith explains everything, I prefer the empire strikes back over revenge of the sith as a sequel, but as a movie, I prefer revenge of the sith, this movie also has a lot heart and stakes. So it's not perfect but it's still great.","

In my opinion it's the best in the series.The characters are more fleshed out this time,and the plot is more complex and darker then the previous installment.

","jboothmillard","4 March 2005","One of the best film sequels ever made (along with The Godfather, Part II and Terminator 2), this is the second part to great original trilogy, and saga, from writer/creator George Lucas and director Irvin Kershner. ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" on the ice world of Hoth, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is investigating possible Empire activity, only to be attacked by a snow monster. He manages to escape with the help of the Force and his light sabre, but he is still stuck in the blizzard, and before going unconscious and being rescued by Han Solo (Harrison Ford), he sees a vision of Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi (Sir Alec Guinness) telling him to go to the Degobah system and find Jedi master Yoda. So after a quick battle between the Rebels and the Empire, Luke, with R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) heads to this planet, and eventually he finds Yoda (a Muppet style creature voiced and performed by Muppet member Frank Oz, aka Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear), and they start training. Meanwhile, Han, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) are in the Millennium Falcon, pursued by the Empire (because of a tracking device), and hide for a while in what they thought was the inside of a near meteor, but it was in fact the belly of a giant worm alien. When they do get out, they head for their destination to fix the ship, the planet Bespin, where they are greeted by Han's old shifty gambler friend (and original Millennium Falcon owner), Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). But what they didn't know is that Darth Vader (acted by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) and the stormtroopers arrived before them, and they are the bait of Vader's trap to get Luke, who he has become obsessed with finding. As a prize for finding them, Han Solo is frozen in carbonate and (when confirmed he is alive) is give to bounty hunter Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch) to be delivered to crime lord Jabba the Hutt (who you saw in the first film). Eventually, Luke does land on the planet, and he and Darth have a long and exciting light sabre fight, while Leih's gang escape in the Millennium Falcon. The pinnacle twist and great quote of the film is, after cutting Luke's hand off, Darth Vader revealing the truth about his father's death, he says ""I am your father!"" After this he is eventually rescued, has his hand replaced, and Lando and Chewbacca fly away in the Millennium Falcon, a more more obvious 'to be continued' moment. Also starring Julian Glover as General Veers. It won the Oscar for Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Music for John Williams and a Special Achievement Award (for visual effects), it won the BAFTA for Best Original Film Music for John Williams, and it was nominated for Best Production Design/Art Direction and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 67 on The Ultimate Film, and along with the Episode IV: A New Hope, both were number 1 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!","

Even better directing, it's the greatest space movie pretty much ever made.It's only better because ""Star Wars"" set this one up perfectly. And it allowed a suspenseful ""Return of the Jedi"", which needed all it could get, because it was the worst of the Original's, but still pretty darn good. Overall even though it was made in the 80's it was still captivating to a boy used to computer graphics. The absolute best part was the final lightsaber battle between Vader and Luke where... well, I won't spoil it for those who haven't heard the line.","

The film takes us in different directions & to different planets & one of the things - in an odd way that is satisfying to the audience - is that on the surface the evil Empire WINS in the end making this one of the few American movies to my knowledge where this happens!!

And it is actually quite good.

We were all so very much standing next to Luke and Han, so that they have almost helped share their world with us, but also influence popular culture today in a somewhat surrealistic concept, where the actors/actresses step out of the TV/silver screen and dictate the 'real' world, using their 'fantasy' world to justify for their candor - in an almost 'emperor's new clothes' fashion. Only the greatest movies have the ability to enmesh reality and the fiction on the screen. Lord of the Rings did it, Hitchcock did it, and Lucas did it! Lucas made us believe in a world far away, long long time ago, which any other creator would have made seem like another Star Trek or Stargate episode (like the prequels).","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","joetufano719","12 November 2012","When this movie came out in 1980, people were unsure of how it can live up to the hype due to the success of the previous film. But it did deliver! This movie went to even darker places this time around, and the characters are left at the lowest point by the end of the film. Great action sequences, great acting and above all the biggest twist of all time! Story: The Rebels have built a new base of operations called Echo Base on the ice planet Hoth after the Empire chased them off Yavin IV in response to the Death Star being destroyed. It's not long before the Empire discovers their new hideout and force the Rebels once again to flee from the invasion of Imperial AT-AT walkers. Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca and C-3PO escape in the Millennium Falcon, but are later captured by Darth Vader on Cloud City with Han Solo being frozen in carbonite and handed over to Boba Fett who takes him back to Jabba the Hutt. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker travels to the swamp planet Dagobah to continue his Jedi training but this time from former Jedi Master Yoda. During his training, he sees visions of Leia, Han and Chewbacca being kidnapped by Vader and sets out to Cloud Cit to rescue them, only get into a confrontation with Darth Vader where he discovers the most shocking secret about Vader.Everything in this film is close to perfect as you can get: The battle of Hoth is one of my favorite movie battle scenes ever, and the music once again makes it awesome. The asteroid field pursuit is entertaining as hell, and the light saber fight between Luke and Darth Vader... it's basically indescribable. The acting once again is fantastic with Mark Hamill once again giving another solid performance as a young impatient Luke Skywalker who fails every task given to him by Yoda, Harrison Ford once again owning the role of Han Solo and his interactions with Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) make for some really entertaining dialogue. I also like seeing how their relationship actually grows from love/hate to a love relationship, especially since Han grows throughout the trilogy. Billy Dee Williams as Lando brings his own brand of charm to brighten the mood up until he is forced to betray Han, but redeems himself by turning against the Empire and helping Leia attempt to save Han. As for Yoda, he is so awesome in this one! Frank Oz's puppetry is so terrific that it's better than anything CGI can do today (not that I despise CGI). I love the scenes where he's training Luke on Dagobah, especially the part where he goes ""Not this crude matter!"" Darth Vader is more evil than he was in the first one. He's killing lieutenants left and right that it makes me go, ""I'll do whatever you want, just please don't choke me!"" As for the big twist where he says ""I am your father"" to Luke, it still gets me every time. I can't remember the first time I heard him say that line because I was like 5 or 6 years old when I first watched ""Empire"" but when he says it and you hear that music playing in the background and the look on Luke's face... you still feel that shock that Luke feels.It goes without saying that this is not only the best Star Wars movie ever, this is one of the best MOVIES ever made. As for sequels surpassing the predecessor, for me it's right up there with ""The Godfather Part 2"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""T2 - Judgement Day"". Even with the foul taste that a lot of people have in their mouths from the prequel trilogy, they need to watch this again to be reminded that George Lucas gave us a great saga. Final grade: A+","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","JamesHitchcock","17 October 2005","""The Empire Strikes Back"" clearly has the feel of the middle episode of a trilogy. The beginning carries on from the original ""Star Wars"" film; although the Death Star has been destroyed, the Empire remains strong and the evil Darth Vader continues to hunt down the rebels on their base on the icy planet of Hoth. There is no really definite ending; the film might just as well have ended with the words, familiar from old Saturday morning serials, ""To Be Continued""- which of course it was in ""Return of the Jedi"". In between, the mix is much the same as it was in the first ""Star Wars""- a science-fiction adventure incorporating elements of other film genres, notably the war film but also the western, the oriental martial arts film, sword-and-sorcery type fantasy and the Robin Hood type of mediaeval adventure, all topped off with a helping of mystical religion.All the major characters from the original film make a return in this one; Obi-Wan Kenobi was killed off in a duel with Darth Vader, but returns here as a ghost. The main developments in the story are a growing romance between Han Solo and Leia and a startling revelation about Luke's origins. (I won't say what that is). In addition to Luke, Leia, Han and the rest there are two new characters, Lando Calrissian, an old but not necessarily reliable friend of Han Solo, and Yoda. Yoda is a senior member of the Jedi Knights, the mysterious brotherhood to which Obi-Wan also belonged, and the Jedi Master to whom Luke is sent to undertake training with a view to initiation into the order. The scenes between Luke and Yoda strengthen the semi-religious tone already apparent in the first film; the philosophy of the Jedi, as expounded by Yoda, seems to have much in common with Far Eastern religions such as Zen Buddhism. Given the seriousness with which these scenes were obviously intended to be treated, it struck me as unfortunate that Yoda was not a human being but rather a strange alien creature looking like a wizened garden gnome with outsize ears. It was difficult to take seriously anything said by such a bizarre-looking character, especially as Yoda, despite his supposed immense wisdom, seemed incapable of mastering the rules of English syntax, coming up with odd sentences such as ""This one a long time have I watched"".There is some good acting, particularly from Harrison Ford as Han Solo, a character who undergoes considerable development from the cynic of the first film to a man prepared to take on responsibilities and take risks for what he believes in. It is perhaps a pity that Alec Guinness's role here is rather limited, as he was easily the best actor in the original film. I am not one of those who regard the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy as great cinematic masterpieces, but there is plenty to enjoy in them if you do not take them too seriously and regard them simply as entertaining science-fiction adventures. This is as true of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as it is of its predecessor. 7/10","

","easternmoviecritic","3 August 2009","The Empire Strikes Back is an example of how well done a sequel can be, it takes the series to a whole new level and is an improvement over A New Hope. The amazing thing is that this time Lucas wasn't the director. That doesn't change anything, he guided Irvin and ESB is still his creation. This time everything is on a larger scale. The battles aren't puny and meaningless, they are actual battles. The movie starts with the battle for the icy world Hoth. From there the plot splits in 2, one being with Luke and one with the rest: Leia, Han, Chewie, 3PO and R2.We are explained in more detail how the Force works and we see how truly powerful the Empire is. Thanks to the money Lucas earned from A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back has better special effects and some splendid locations, including Hoth and Bespin.But it's not all about battles, the love story part of the series is also developed, Luke's struggle to understand the Force and use it continues, while Vader is more determined than ever.Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is a remarkable chapter of the Star Wars saga.Final Score: 5/5 or 10/10","

","Nirgaul","11 July 2005","I usually watch this show every two years to keep a fresh perspective on it. This is the first real film experience I ever had, and it remains the strongest influence on me. The thing that amazes me about this, time and again, is the ingenuity of the pacing, the orchestration, and the motion of the vehicles and ships.This is a triumph of editing.The motion control work is so artfully done, it puts CGI to shame. Watch how the ships move. They dance alongside the camera, swooping toward and away from us. Look at the terrain whiz by in the snowspeeder search. No CGI can convince like that. This is basically helicopter footage on fast-forward, through the cockpit of a prop ship, but it works. The amount of activity going on screen at any given time is frenetic.And then we have Frank Oz. Forget that we live in a world where there are Yoda pajamas, animal crackers, dolls, etc., and just focus on this wonderful character in this one film. He is more lifelike than many of the actors we have working today. When he is on screen, I believe he exists. That is pure movie magic. Mark Hamill is given a tough job with this. Whenever you have a multi-million dollar film that hinges on the performance of one person and a sock puppet, there's pressure. People have blasted him for years over his acting, but it works. He pulls his share of the work and sells every scene.From the opening crawl onward, this never lets up. The music is simply beautiful. This is why I go to the movies.","

","myblueblazer","21 May 2022","Review:
This is basically the fun of the first Star Wars, but faster, more intense pacing, a deeper story line, Mature characters. And of course THE PLOT TWIST TO END ALL PLOT TWISTS....Takeaways:
-The first Star Wars, A New Hope was great. It was a cultural experience for the Movie world. So how would they top the first one? You keep the fun and increase it. Make it non stop. And you also include a deeper story, throw in more maturity, and you make it unpredictable. George Lucas apparently knew all this and he brought this in his sequel, even though he wasn't the director this time around (Irvin Kirshner directed The Empire Strikes Back)-The Epic Battle of Hoth is great and you are seeing most of the snowspeeder action through luke's point of view. You are with him in the Snowsppeder Cockpit.Luke has great development as he goes from curious farmboy to brave but impatient fighter.-YODA!!!!Yoda is similar to an old prophet Sage, a Buddhist monk, wizard, and zen master.Yoda is living true proof that ""Size Matters Not""He even teaches this and more things to the impatient student Luke.Luke:""I don't believe it""
Yoda: ""That is Why you fail""-Imagine if Han Actually Died when he was being frozen in carbonite. Something of Course That Harrison Ford had lobbied for...-I Gotta HAND it to you Luke, you did well, but don't know how to win a lightsaber duel yet.This Cliffhanger was well done. I am more critical towards current cliffhangers in movies because they copy it off of Star Wars without thinking it through, and they come across as unnerving and horrible. The Empire Strikes back did it very well though, and it is the Best Cliffhanger ending to exist!Vader: ""I AM YOUR FATHER.""

","GuyCC","18 June 1999","The Empire Strikes Back represents everything that I've come to expect from a film: Brave heroes, menacing villains, a well-written story, fantastic action scenes, a strong supporting cast, drama, romance, surprises, and a beautiful musical score. ""Empire"" focuses heavily on developing the characters from the first film, rounding out their personalities, and introduces several great new characters (Yoda, Lando Calrissian, Boba Fett). The special effects still hold up well to today's standards, the dialogue is witty and intelligent, and the character dynamic allows the actors to play well off of each other. It's a very different kind of film in that the ""good guys always win"" theory is proved wrong, and Darth Vader's surprise revelation at the end of the movie is still one of the best movie moments ever, which was shocking for its time. This is one of the few films that I find that never diminishes after each viewing. Even without the ""Star Wars"" name behind it, the amount of movie ""magic"" this film generates captivates me just as much now as it did when I was a child. This is a prime example of cinematic perfection, and in no way should be missed by anyone. A true classic and worthy of the ""10"" that I gave it.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","tjgoalie13","28 October 2015","Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is arguably the best Star Wars film ever made, and one of the best films ever made. The film immortalized the already iconic characters that George Lucas created in Star Wars, while making a very dense and entertaining film. The Empire Strikes Back is so great because of the improvements made to Darth Vader, the ambitious tonal change, and the fact that it still contains one of the best twists ever. With enough analysis the most impressive thing about The Empire Strikes Back is how hard it is to find flaws in the film.Darth Vader still stands, and probably always will stand as one of the best villains ever brought to the screen, second on my list only to The Dark Knight's Joker. However, in Vader's first appearance Vader is slightly inconsistent in that he's a temperamental villain often yelling, which isn't nearly as scary as a villain who remains calm. I would contest that the best villains act like they are always in control, whether they are not, it is in The Empire Strikes Back that Vader develops into this villain, while also systematically murdering his failing accomplices. It could be argued that Vader's development helped the tonal change that Empire Strikes Back brought.It's another testament to the villain, when they are so chilling that the tone of the film seemingly dives with them. As Vader develops into the more controlled, systematic villain the tone of the film dives into a darker world. With Star Wars being considered, at least partially, a kids film it seems extremely ambitious of Lucas and Kershner to make a film directed at kids dark, something many filmmakers are unwilling to do today. The dark tone helps accentuate the character development as the characters hit their all time lows, and the film's tone represents that the world isn't always nice.The story for Empire Strikes Back, being the middle film in the trilogy, had the most freedom, and used it accordingly. The story of Empire Strikes back is arguably, the strongest in the series, as the film was one of the earliest to say the bad guy can win, in a giant blockbuster, another very ambitious move. However, the best element of the story is the unpredictable turns it makes, in particular it's iconic twist. The twist remains one of the most famous of all time, for a reason, and the film benefits from it.In the end Empire Strikes Back has the best story in the trilogy, the best character development, is very ambitious, and immortalizes it's iconic villain. On top of all of that it has been copied numerous times over the years, and remains one of the best films ever made. Empire Strikes Back still stands as the embodiment of what makes Star Wars so great.","

","MrScotsman","27 December 2021","The Empire Strikes Back is the last Star Wars property ever made that I genuinely love. It marked an early peak for the franchise and unfortunately it all went down hill from here (with some minor spikes later on).I genuinely have difficulty finding things wrong with this film, even in the special edition versions. The pacing is slower, yet more methodical and introspective. The character work is more well done, and the acting has gone up a couple notches.This is also the film that made Darth Vader iconic. Though Star Wars was his first appearance, he had much more screen time here and was much more of a threat. Of course there is the infamous ""No, I am your father"" twist that changed our perspective of the events of both this film and the previous one.There was a genuine effort to continue and expand the story and setting of this universe. This movie is not interested with fan-pandering and retreading the same water, but breaking new ground and the result is a different, but superior sequel.The Empire Strikes Back is a darker and more mature film than its predecessor. There is less hopeful triumph and more loss and consequences. There is less black and white and much more grey. It continued the simple plot of the original, but made it just a bit more complicated and a lot more interesting.The best part of Star Wars was its structure and pacing, whereas Empire's greatest strength is its character work and themes.I should also mention that this was the film that introduced Yoda and further explained what the Force really is. That vague, poetic description that he gave was all we really needed. It was a plot device that enriched the mythos of the franchise.Luke, the main character was good in the original, but like most aspects of this film, he is expanded upon and improved as a result. His struggle is with his own impulsiveness and over reliance on strength and power, which is what he needs to work on if he is to become a true Jedi. He deliberately goes against the wishes of his master to save his friends, but fails and loses a hand as a result. He learns the truth that neither Obi-Wan, nor Yoda ever told him, which gives their actions and words (or the lack thereof) a different meaning in this context.The Jedi masters are not without their flaws after all.The Empire Strikes Back is a movie about facing the consequences for your actions, whether they be good or evil. It is realistic and grounded in that sense. It presents the audience with a story about struggle and failure and is not afraid to shy away from the more difficult aspects of life personified in this filmIf I said much more about Empire, I would consider it an essay so I should wrap up. As a whole, this movie is incredible and thought provoking. There is not a single bad or tedious moment in this movie and hits all the right beats. The only problem with this film is that it ends and the franchise never reaches these heights again. Not even close.I give The Empire Strikes Back a 10/10 with the title of ""Outstanding!""","

Now, I'm a little older and can appreciate this movie. This is the best Star Wars movie hands down. Not my favorite, but the greatest. This takes the Star Wars saga to a whole new level with the introduction of Yoda and the fleshing out of Darth Vader. Every returning character from A New Hope is given so much more to work with and it shows. We learn more about Han's past, Luke's past, and Luke's future. The visual feel of the movie is incredible. From Bespin, the cloud city to Dagobah, the lonely hideout for Master Yoda, each one of the locations presented support the turmoiled, chill of space feel that dominates the movie.The climax of the movie is the most memorable climax of all time. It's been alluded to more times than can be counted. It also takes the battle between good and evil from a back and white area to a shade of gray. The fact that the innocence of Luke can come from the pure evil of Darth Vader is perhaps the biggest revelation. This is one of the best sequels of all time. Check it out.**** out of ****","

","trooper5783","17 May 2015","The Empire Strikes Back is one of the few movies I call pitch perfect. Everything is flawless- the action? Edge of your seat! The drama? Heart-wrenching and powerful! The comedy? Frequently clever and hysterical! The special effects? Better than A New Hope, and then some! As for the 2004 DVD version, it still has the original flavor of the theatrical cut, the touches are few, and still has most shots from the original version. Also, may I add that all of the characters are perfectly developed and lovable, villain or hero. Han Solo is a great character in this, all because of his charming and awesome performance by Harrison Ford. My favorite character from Star Wars is Chewbacca, and there is no exception here. The stop motion animation done with the AT-ATs and the Taun-Tauns still are amazing today, and the wonders of the ship battles are just as beautiful. Overall, Empire is my favorite Star Wars, and one of my favorite movies. It has everything- heart, humor, action, drama, suspense. I highly recommend you see this one(if you haven't seen it already).","

","ftrain","24 February 2005","As great as the original Star Wars may be, The Empire Strikes Back remains the best film in the series. As the years pass, the real achievement of Empire only grows. While the original film has grown somewhat dated in appearance, and Return of the Jedi feels a bit silly now, Empire has maintained remarkable staying power. The effects in the film feel as fresh now as they did in 1980, and as importantly the story and tone of the film still hold an ominous feel and lend the series the grandeur that made it so lasting. Without Empire, Star Wars would have been remembered but not nearly in the same way. Everything that was begun in Star Wars was expanded and improved upon here, right down to the score Remember, this was the movie that introduced the now-famous and ridiculously overplayed Imperial March composed by John Williams. And virtually every scene is now iconic--the Imperial Walkers in the snow, Luke's training in the swamp, the asteroid field chase of the Millennium Falcon, the Cloud City, Luke's lightsaber battle with Vader. When I think of ""Star Wars"", most of the images that come to mind first are from Empire. The colors and textures of the film are so sharp and rich.A truly majestic film. One of the great visual statements in the history of movies, and one of the most successful realizations of a movie vision we will ever see.","

He does remember the first ""Star Wars"" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).I can't review ""Star Wars"" as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always Han Solo). My friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home. I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to ""Star Wars"" and I think people either just understand that or they don't. I don't get the appeal of ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Star Trek"" but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas's films.I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker.Grade (for the entire trilogy): A+","

","CinemaSerf","7 June 2023","I have reviewed this film before but I thought that it deserved an extra special mention. Yesterday, this was the first film I saw in a cinema since we were all confined to barracks - and boy what a cracker. Where to start with the superlatives? It's fantastic - right from the opening bars of John Williams' score; on through the three mini-adventures rolled into one, we are treated to a marvellous feast of well-written, snappily directed, entertaining action packed adventure. Picking up from the first film, our rebels are holed up on a frozen planet being relentlessly pursued by Darth Vader. When one of his probes discovers their icebound base, they've got to get the hell out of there. Now sure, the CGI suffers a bit after 40 years; and can someone please tell me what the point of these lumbering Imperial Walkers is? They are like metal polar bears that constantly trip over their own shoelaces, but aside from those most minor of criticisms we have a great story; characters that we care about (personally, I'm an huge Vader fan) and who develop plausible, credible personalities; the detailed animations of ""Yoda"" are superb to see again on the big screen and it builds excellently to a sword fight the like of which has not been seen since ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938). It is, I think, better then the first film and for my money is the best sci-fi film ever made. Made for the big screen - and brilliantly made at that!","

","owenmul","27 March 2015","The Empire Strikes back is the best of the original trilogy, as well as being the best of the entire series. Its so good that it is on my top ten films of all time. It manages to switch between the cheery space opera tone of the original film with added darkness and despair.The characters this time around are given much more screen time to grow and develop, being ever more three-dimensional. This depth of character is what adds to the first film and makes it so much better than the rest of the series. It shows the good and the evil, the greed and corruption and the tyranny that grows within the corners of the of the Star Wars universe.The cinematography, score and special effects remain quite consistent, moving on from those that were present in the first film. The only exception of this is the special effects, which have been slightly spruced up since the first film.The story itself has become a lot more brutal and unforgiving, without moving into spoilers, it fully embraces the dark side of the force and fully explores the darkest corners of its plot.It is because of the emotions stirred in Empire that the entire series takes on a mythic quality that resonates back to the first and ahead to the third.This is the heart of the franchise, this is the peak. Everything that has been added and built upon from the first film is fantastic, there are no conceivable downsides to this space epic.More Reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/","

","DKosty123","23 February 2007","Long ago, in a Galaxy far away came a film which saved FOX studios from bankruptcy. It was conceived by a 16 year old George Lucas after he saw the 1959 film Ben Hur. This gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force, an evil empire, emperor, a purpose for our universe. This film was considered a weak link of these three when it was first released. As the years have gone by, it has grown in popularity. It is as solid as either 4 or 6. It has great acting, a good script, excellent action sequences, & introduces Yoda. Granted if you watch the series in number order, Yoda pops up earlier, but this is the real introduction to him here, & it fits so well.Luke Skywalker completes a lot of Jedi training with Yoda, & one thing that was explained in episode 1 better is why Yoda fears training Luke so much. It was explained in episode 4 too with Obie Ones dialog about Vadar. Strange how this plot line runs together yet spreads apart.This film reveals that Luke is the son of Darth Vadar, a man which he views an evil monster. It is a relationship which is almost similar to the relationship between Mesala & Ben Hur in that in both cases- Hur & Luke, their relationships to the other character are shaken at their own souls foundation. The more one looks at this film, the better it looks.","

Luke Skywalker is instructed to seek Jedi training from Yoda. An attack by Imperial forces leaves the Rebel base in ruins but Han Solo, Princess Leia and company narrowly escape in the Millennium Falcon. They venture to Cloud City where Lando Calrissian betrays them thus setting a trap for Skywalker. Cliffhanger ending hinders it in standing on its own but director Irwin Kershner explores darker aspects.

Harrison Ford as Han learns to put the needs of others ahead of his own particularly when sacrifices arise. Carrie Fisher return as Leia who strengthens her leadership. Billy Dee Williams as Lando realizes his mistakes and hopes correction is possible. David Prowse dons the suit and presents the intimidating presence of Darth Vader who presents those ever famous hard hitting words to Luke.

","Dan_W_Reviews","12 February 2023","The Empire Strikes Back is an absolute classic science fiction film released back in 1980. It continues the story of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo as they battle the evil Galactic Empire.One of the many strengths of this film is its intricate and well-developed plot, which includes numerous engaging twists and turns. The film's visual effects and breathtaking action sequences are mesmerizing, and are elevated by John Williams' iconic musical score.The Empire Strikes Back also delves deeper into the mythos of the Star Wars universe, introducing legendary characters such as Yoda, and exploring the concept of the Force in greater detail. The film's central themes of temptation, sacrifice, and redemption are expertly explored through the character arcs of the protagonists, making this installment both emotionally satisfying and thought-provoking.On a technical level, the film is an undeniable triumph, with excellent production design, costumes, and special effects that hold up even by today's standards. The performances of the cast, especially Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, are also standout.In conclusion, The Empire Strikes Back is a masterful and groundbreaking film that is a must-see for fans of science fiction and action. Its timeless appeal and impact on popular culture cannot be overstated, and it remains a favorite of mine to this day which is why I've rated it a 9 out of 10.","

","tylerkom","13 September 2020","This film as well as A New Hope has put me in a very very strange predicament. How exactly does one evaluate a film in which one knows the entire plot a priori, to no fault of the film. As well as a film with astounding visuals at the time, but very poorly aged visuals and shot selection today. Such is my problem with star wars as a franchise. So considering the circumstances, let me shortly say the following.Star Wars is an excellent intellectual property based on an excessively cheesy movie franchise. I feel similarly to the star wars franchise as I do the Marvel cinematic universe. They are a set of fun and entertaining family movies that can make your imagination go absolutely wild. I know I'm not alone in pretending that I was a Jedi or a Superhero when I was young. What the franchise is not is any sort of art film or strong statement about anything. It is pure fun, but perhaps better left in nostalgia than a film to come back to. As the weight of the visual technology fades, it is hard for me to justify that the average storytelling and wonderful soundtrack are enough to carry it.Conclusion: wonderful IP and universe, very cheesy film.","

This chapter starts off with Luke Skywalker (Hamill), Han Solo (Ford), Leia Organa (Fisher) Chewbacca (Mahew), C-3P0 (Daniels) and R2-D2 (Baker) on an icy planet, Hoth. Luke gets hurt while trying to locate a meteor and sees a vision of Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi (Guiness) telling him to go to a planet, the Dagobah System where old Jedi master, Yoda will train him. Soon, Han finds Luke and they're rescued by rebel pilots who take them back to the base where Luke is nursed back to health. When Vader finds their base, they escape and head to Cloud City, where Han's old pal, Lando Calrissian (Williams) lives. Luke goes to the Dagobah System and soon meets Yoda (Voiced by Oz) beginning his training while his friends become Lando's guests learning that they're used as Vader's bait to lure Luke to the dark side. When Luke senses his friends in trouble, he attempts to rescue them and confronts Vader. I recommend this great Star Wars follow-up.","

","Movie_Muse_Reviews","18 October 2008","""A New Hope"" opened us up to a galaxy of possibilities. ""The Empires Strikes Back"" begins to show us just how large that scope really is. Not only that, but there is a definite sense that ""Star Wars"" has grown up a little bit in Episode V, including taking a much darker tone.After the destruction of the Death Star, the war between the Rebellion and the Empire is on. ""Empire"" takes us first to the icy tundra of Hoth, then to the jungles of Degobah and lastly the futuristic Bespin aka Cloud City. Immediately our imaginations begin to expand. In terms of characters, we are introduced to Yoda, the ancient Jedi master who begins training Luke. There is also Boba Fett, the cool-looking bounty hunter in the awesome ship and Lando Calrissian, the handsome new friend to the original gang. The film doesn't settle with what we are familiar with from Episode 4 and keeps pushing our imagination further.Most importantly, the characters that we fell in love with previously seem a lot more viable than they once were, not merely vessels for the exchange of brash remarks and one-liners. Princess Leia (now sporting a more femme fatal look as suits her true character) and Han Solo begin to carve out a relationship that is essential to the greatness of this film. Luke's maturity is just as important. We're blown away by the famous ending scene with Luke and Vader because of how far Luke has come since his days on a desert farm. He no longer sounds like an idiot every time he opens his mouth. Last but far from least, even Vader, the enigma, becomes more complicated in this film. The character development is really what makes this film considered the best of the entire saga by many, many fans. So many times, nearly all the time, do middle films in a trilogy fail in comparison to the films on either side of them, but ""Empire"" doesn't. Most of the time it can end up as just a bridge with no ability to stand on its own, but it stands on its own. It borrows just enough from ""Hope"" and sets things in motion just enough that it does its job as a transitioning film, but the climax is kind of thrilling in its own way, not just as in we can't wait to see what happens next. It has plenty of its own, new elements to keep it fresh and like an expansion of the original as opposed to a mere continuation of it.","

","alene-56179","23 June 2020","The Empire Strikes Back expands upon the established world of Star Wars without forgetting what made the first movie so amazing. The effects are just as enthralling as they were in Star Wars (if not more so), as shown in the amazing new worlds that Empire introduces (Hoth, Cloud City, Dagobah), and John Williams once again blows us away with a score that is on par with his work in the previous movie.
The story takes us in a different direction than Star Wars, giving the audience a greater insight into the workings of the Empire and Darth Vader's character. Vader's arc culminates in his iconic confrontation with Luke Skywalker at Cloud City, which ends with possibly the greatest twist in movie history.
Empire's story is more mature than its predecessor, and leading actors have matured and greatly improved as well (props to Mark Hamill, who did about half of his scenes with a puppet and still made them believable). The dialogue is sharp, the camera work is clean, and new iconic characters get to shine in this movie. I especially loved when Yoda gave his explanation of what the force is, increasing the audience's understanding without removing any its mysticism.
Overall, this movie expertly balances pretty much every aspect it should. The acting, the visual set pieces, the sound design, the score, and the story all shine, combining to create a masterpiece of a movie.10/10","

","funkyfry","8 January 2007","It's wonderful that Lucasfilm has finally consented to release this film in its original format without new additions and alterations. Now we can see the original matte work and effects, which are quite beautiful accomplishments and stand among the best of their era.The film is the best directed of the entire series, suffering from none of Lucas' poor directing of actors and Marquand's tentative camera handling. That said, Kershner himself is not an exceptional director except insofar as how he works with actors and his light comic touch. This film relies heavily on storyboarding and sticking fairly closely to its script, which was penned by Lucas himself from a draft by the great Leigh Brackett, with further refinement by Lawrence Kasdan.The story takes the characters from the original film, with the addition of the charming Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), further along their personal and political quests. The film does a good job of developing these characters far beyond what their potential in the original film or their treatment in the disappointing subsequent ""Jedi"" were able to suggest, and of tying in the development of the characters' relationships with each other parallel to the plot of the film. The only unfortunate aspect in terms of the film's pacing is that the most exciting battle sequences fall so early in the film, leaving us a bit let down by the film's dialog-heavy middle section until we get to the stirring (and somewhat dark) conclusion in Cloud City.It's notable that this is almost the only Star Wars film that does not feature the desert planet Tatooine. This can be seen as symbolic of the fact that this was the film that George Lucas had the least to do with -- Tatooine represents his hometown of Modesto in the other films. I also do not consider it a coincidence that this, almost universally acknowledged by fans as the best in the series, was the one with which George Lucas had the least involvement. I've always believed that a lot of the credit for the success of these first 2 films should belong to the producer Gary Kurtz, a fellow USC grad who cut his teeth working with Roger Corman (producing Monte Hellman's first films) and who developed these 2 films' concept of ""used space"" visual design which was later abandoned in favor of a glossy more standard ""new space"" look. These 2 productions are on a higher level overall than anything that Lucas did after the partnership ended, which is particularly striking in that the excessively bright and shiny ""Jedi"" followed only a few years later. Kurtz went on to produce ""The Dark Crystal"" -- a superior production IMHO to any of Lucas' solo (read: non Spielberg/Kurtz) efforts.","

","freemantle_uk","17 April 2010","The first Star Wars film was released it was a massive success audience were craving for more. George Lucas promised more and when The Empire Strikes Back was released in 1980, it was not just a film release, it was an event. Despite fears that a sequel would never be as good as the original and the film technically under-performance this is one of the few sequels that was better then the original.Despite the Rebel Alliance destroying the Death Star and the universe now safe from the ultimate weapon the Empire had gone on the offensive against the rebels, hounding them out of the bases. They are led by Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones), the most fearsome commander for the Empire. On the ice planet Hoth, the Rebels have to fled when the Empire's forces attack. Within the Rebel camp Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamall) receives a message from Obi-Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi (Alec Guinness) from beyond the grave to go to the planet Dagobah and learn the ways of the Jedi from a powerful master Yoda (Frank Oz). His friends Hans Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and 3CPO (Anthony Daniels) have to escape Hoth and end up being chased by Darth Vader. They set out for safety to the Cloud City led by Hans' friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Vader himself becomes obsessed about finding the Millennium Falcon, and Luke who becomes a major threat to the Empire.Lucas did the smartest thing he could with this sequel, he took more of a back sit. It is known that he is not the best screenwriter and director in the world, but is he a great producer and ideas man. He came up with the basic story idea and wrote some of the key scenes, but it was Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan who wrote most of the screenplay and Irvin Kershner was brought in to direct. This team made a brilliant sequel expanding on the ideas of the original ideas of the film, from the mystical powers of the Jedi to the multiple worlds and creatures that are created to how the Empire function, which was a cross between the Roman Empire and Nazi Germany. Brackett and Kasdan with Kershner's direction were able to interweave multiple story lines in a space set epic. Like the original the Empire Strikes Back was able to use many sci-fi ideas into the film, multiple alien races, psychic powers, grant designs of futuristic weapons and warfare and a setting crossing fighting a dictatorship and general lawlessness. Kershner was able to make a atmospheric film which a darker in tone, particularly in the third act. He shot some of the best action sequences in the whole series, like the battle of Hoth, and the fight between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader was not just an excellent fight but also brooding experience, filled with tension and is one of the best sequences in film history. As well as it being the best Star Wars film it is also Kershner best film by a long way. Despite the darker tone Kershner was still able to lighten the film enough and allow the audience to relax with some well timed humour.The characters are developed even further. Darth Vader is even more menacing then he was in the first film with a dark ambition and secret, making him one of the best screen villains ever. He oozes a dark charisma and he is as ruthless as Hitler, Stalin and Mao when it came to military command and tactics. The relationship between Leia and Hans Solo also improves, from hating each other to discovering their true feelings. Luke too grows from a competent commander to a man who has to discovery his destiny, but also prone to his emotions, when he needed to master them. Billy Dee Williams is an excellent addition to the series and his character represent a moral dualities that inflecting the world they live in. They is good acting all round, with James Earl Jones and Harrison Ford being of the most worthy note.A must see for film fans everywhere.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","jennifer_litchfield","12 January 2003","Star Wars - Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back, rather suffers from 'middle child' syndrome.  Being the second of the original trilogy it has neither the fresh appeal of originality that marked its predecessor, nor is it required to reach any conclusions.  The result is a film with decidedly minimalist plot development.  The Empire is still hunting down the Rebel Alliance, Luke Skywalker is still training to be a Jedi knight, and. . . . .. . . . . well, that's pretty much it.  Instead of a solid storyline, the viewer is treated to 122 minutes of cobbled-together battle sequences (although watch for the impressive Imperial walker troop carriers, which resemble out-sized armoured elephants). The characters however, have developed considerably since the first film - it's nice to see loyal Chewbacca show a sense of humour.  The sexual tension between Princess Leia and Han Solo is palpable. . . . . . . . . . until they kiss (which looks about as exciting as snogging a shoe).  In a clever twist, Yoda the Jedi Master is not a Hercules-type warrior, but a wizened green dwarf; the characterisation would have worked even better had he not had a voice a-la-Sesame Street. In the Special Edition of Episode IV, A New Hope, there is an obvious and uncomfortable chasm between those scenes which have been unaltered since they were shot in 1977 and those that were digitally re-mastered and altered 20 years later.  Fortunately the same is not the case in Episode V.  But why was it necessary to darken the picture contrast so drastically? For fanatics The Empire Strikes Back is of course an integral component of the Star Wars dynasty.  Viewers with a more casual interest in the story could probably get away with skipping this installment altogether.","

","r_scott73","17 March 2012","It is not always possible for a sequel to re-capture the peculiar magic of an original film. 'The Empire Strikes Back' manages to do so by being less of a sequel than it is a new film on its own. The story begun in 'Star Wars' is advanced, the characters & their relationships with one another are deepened and the film itself abandons much of the easy spirit of the first film in favour of a darker and more uncertain tone. If the first film was largely about heroism, the second is largely concerned with struggle. The main characters are soundly tested in this film and for the most part, they come up short.This is also the film that transforms Darth Vader into one of the screen's great villains. Vader was interesting in 'Star Wars,' but he is iconic in 'The Empire Strikes Back' and he rightfully takes his place as not only a great villain, but a great character. In spite of the despair that runs through the film, the visuals and imagination so apparent in 'Star Wars' returns here, as well. The film is littered with awesome action sequences and more than enough 'coolness' to measure up to its predecessor.Again, the original (1980) version is the one to see - if given the option - although the enhancements made to this film are somewhat less invasive than those applied to 'Star Wars.' Still, the film is more charming and more polished its original release. It is considerably less delightful than its predecessor, but it is every bit as good of a film, if not even slightly superior to 'Star Wars.'","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","KlinePatsy","5 August 2007","Star wars is a Saturday morning breakfast serial, with the upbeat 'let's have an Olympic medal ceremony' ending...Empire discards the fluffiness and moves away from its simplistic predecessor's obvious appeal to the child fanbase, without scaring everybody away in the process. The 2nd Star Wars film takes the original cast and subjects them to 2 hours of major discomfort...A forbidding icy planet replete with nasty creatures. There are ugly bounty hunters, monsters hiding out in the depths of asteroid fields, and Luke's foray into the black swamp of the Degobah system. It's a more taut, curiously downbeat film that slows almost to a halt in places, as Luke meets the Jedi Master who will teach him the ways of the force. The set pieces more than make up for the lack of pace...The opening battle on the Ice planet is a visually effective affair, and the stormtroopers have never looked as cool when they don their winter outfits. The asteroid chase and cloud city sequence are visual treats, that take you into the mysterious heart of the Star Wars Universe. The character development glues everything together. Luke's maturing process in the darkness of Degobah..Han and Leia's romantic chemistry, the droids comic relief and interplay with Chewbacca solidifies the group together and establishes a team spirit that was coming together at the end of Episode IV. The centrepiece of the film is the epic showdown between Luke and Vader,with that massive revelation, which inevitably ranks as one of Cinema's all time memorable moments. And it's a great sequence, from Vader's sobering welcome 'The force is with you young Skywalker, but you are not a Jedi yet' to the almost surreal climax. The forces of darkness loom large at every turn of the film...you get the feeling that the rebels are just slightly out of their depth. There is an underlying menace at work that heightens the dramatic tension..Vader is never as beautifully evil as he is in Empire. We finally see just why he is (Emperor aside) the top dog in the galaxy, as he lays waste to his own generals in ruthless fashion. We get some great new characters...Han's old buddy Lando Calrissien (sp?) is the slimy administrator of cloud city, who finds himself in a no-win situation, and there's the legendary Boba Fett..bounty hunter with balls of steel, and an outfit so cool it instantly establishes him as a Star Wars icon. And of course, the emperor rears his ugly head, and we get a taster of his malevolance. Any faults? It's hard to find much complaint. Some of the dialogue strays into cheeseland, the pace is interrupted with the curious but necessary Degobah scenes, but all in all, the sum of the parts adds up to a supremely effective, tightly woven sci-fi drama, the most deliciously dark of all Star Wars movies, and the most mature. Classic entertainment, stuck in a time capsule of its own, with enough memorable moments to ensure its place in the higher echelons of cinema history.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","Horst_In_Translation","3 February 2016","""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is the second film from the ""Star Wars"" franchise and the fifth in terms of chronology of the contents depicted in there. It was directed by Irvin Kershner over 35 years ago and had some success with the Academy Awards, even if not nearly as much as the first film. And I myself must say that I found it not better than the first (even if the IMDb rating says so), but also not much worse. Once again, it delivers especially on the visual side in terms of sets, cinematography and special effects while coming a bit short in terms of the story. The characters are all fairly memorable though, the humans and the others. There are many many characters that appeared in the first film already, for example Obi Wan Kenobi is even back for one scene, but there are also some interesting new additions, most of all the uber-famous Yoda. And Darth Vader is the main villain in here while being just one of several villains in the first film. A great light saber sequence is included here too.I said that I was not too overwhelmed by the story and that implies the plot as a whole, but also minor scenes and references. One example would be Calrissian's character obviously being totally scared of Vader for almost the entire film and then, completely out of nowhere, he suddenly has no fear anymore and joins the resistance fighters. Not very realistic character development. I also did not like the references in terms of mathematical probability early on. This makes it look really unrealistic that Skywalker survived or that Han Solo managed to control the spacecraft some time later.All in all, it was an okay watch at best and the film has several lengths, starts off nicely with the snow planet scenes, gets worse, but gains some momentum again towards the end. However, I believe that they could have done without roughly 20 minutes and kept this movie at 105 minutes instead of over two hours. You have to be very generous to appreciate this film as a whole as there were more than just a few weaknesses to it. Still, the good moments make somewhat up for it, even if the film never reached real greatness. Not once. Nonetheless, I will be generous and give it a cautious thumbs-up, especially for science fiction fans, which I am probably not really.","

","dworldeater","11 December 2020","Empire Strikes Back has long been my favorite in the original trilogy. I remember going to see this when this was released theatrically as a little kid with my grandma. Empire is one of the rare cases where the sequel blows away the original. Creator George Lucas got some very good help in making this with writer Lawrence Kasdan and hiring a director that actually knows what he was doing, Irvin Kershner. With outsourcing some good help, this collaboration turned out to being a winning team to bring (and improve upon) George Lucas's vision. The film looks incredible to this day and the groundbreaking special effects from the 1st film are improved upon and look better here. The story in this installment is darker(and better suited to my tastes), but is also stronger and better as a whole. The characters are better fleshed out then the original film, the chemistry between the actors and performance are also much better. Not only is Empire Strikes Back the best in the series, but I also would argue that it's the foundation on which the franchise continued to explode and why it holds up today.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","MaxBorg89","16 November 2005","Star Wars may have been a brilliant beginning, but it's The Empire Strikes Back that has made sure this epic saga will remain unforgettable. In my opinion, this is the best Star Wars-movie ever, alongside Revenge of the Sith. Darker and more mature than its predecessor, Empire is 100% masterpiece.As the saga got more mature, George Lucas handed the writing and directing duties to other people: the then unknown Lawrence Kasdan and Lucas'film-making tutor, Irvin Kershner. With these people's help, the movie became darker, Greek tragedy being added to the Flash Gordon-style situations. As for the characters, they became richer and more ""human"" (the Han/Leia romance subplot is pure genius).Among all the great stuff, there are two things fans, but also ""ordinary"" people, tend to remember more fondly about this film: First of all, this is the episode that introduced Yoda, and what an entrance he makes: those expecting the wise Jedi from the prequels won't believe what they're seeing. This Yoda is an old fool who starts playing with Luke Skywalker's tools, stealing his food and even hitting R2-D2 with his stick, before getting mentally stable again and accepting to train Luke, so that the young boy can face Darth Vader who, as the title (and John Williams'magnificent Imperial March) suggests, has an essential role in this movie.But most of all, this film will remain immortal thanks to its shocking climax: unexpected, unpredictable (unless you've already seen the prequels or the Simpsons-episode where Homer spoils it) and unforgettable, it's the stuff really great movies are made of.People say the second part of a trilogy is always the trickiest to achieve; well, in this case, it was worth all the trouble: the Empire doesn't just strike back, it totally wins!","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","barnabyrudge","16 September 2007","This sequel to Star Wars is actually even better than the original, and the best of the entire series. In The Empire Strikes Back, George Lucas allows his story outline to be scripted and directed by other hands (Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan on the screenplay, Irvin Kershner on directorial duties). It is a triumphant science fiction epic, a film of great invention and excitement, with remarkable set pieces and tremendous special effects. The film has a darker quality than its predecessor which lends a more complex and mature feel to the proceedings. It also manages the near-impossible job of being a thoroughly satisfying ""transitory"" movie  you have to remember that this movie doesn't have a start in the normal sense of the word since it continues a story already begun in an earlier film, nor does it have an end as such because much of the plot is left unresolved in preparation for the next movie.The heroes from the first film  Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher)  are continuing their struggle to free the galaxy from the control of the Empire. All those loyal to the Rebel Alliance are hiding out alongside them on an icy planet named Hoth. After a galaxy-wide search the Empire, under the rule of Darth Vader (David Prowse, with the voice of James Earl Jones), finally discovers the true whereabouts of their Rebel enemies. A massive evacuation is mounted by the Rebels as the forces of the Empire lay siege to Hoth in an effort to destroy them. After the battle Luke separates from the others and goes to the Dagobar System, where he hopes to become a Jedi under the tutelage of wise Jedi Master, Yoda (voice of Frank Oz). Meanwhile, Han Solo spends most of the film trying to outrun the Empire's star fleet aboard his spaceship the Millennium Falcon. He decides to drop in on his old buddy Lando Calrisian (Billy Dee Williams) for help, but upon arriving at Lando's city in the clouds there is a nasty surprise in store..The Empire Strikes Back is really exhilarating stuff. It moves along two fronts, cutting from Luke's adventures and Jedi training to the thrilling chase sequence involving Han Solo. Both sections are brilliantly handled, with plenty to keep the audience engrossed. The performances in the Star Wars movies have never been the centre of attention, but there's much to enjoy in this one in terms of acting  Hamill's Luke Skywalker has evolved from the simplistic hero of the earlier film into someone more ambitious and tormented. Ford manages to make the roguish Han Solo cooler and more likable than ever, while Fisher's Princess Leia is no longer a helpless victim in need of rescuing but has a much tougher, more resourceful side to her character. Highlights of the film include a stunning battle on the surface of the ice planet Hoth, a space chase through an asteroid belt, and a prolonged closing duel between Luke and Darth Vader during which Vader makes a shattering revelation!! A great film.","

","JoeKarlosi","29 August 2006","This is one of the SW films I've seen before, back in 1997 when they were re-released to theatres. I didn't recall much about it when I watched it again recently but found it to be highly entertaining and certainly a ""new"" experience and a revelation after recently having become familiar with Episodes I, II, III and IV. It's much more enjoyable and interesting when you know what everyone's talking about! This being the second of the ""original"" films, coming after the mega-success of the first movie, there was obviously more money spent on the sequel and it shows. Many impressive locations and effects, and I really loved the music score this time around (especially the ominous ""theme"" each time we returned to Darth Vader's ship). Better performances from the main cast (especially Mark Hamill), too.One interesting observation for me is that I'm noticing how dated many of the ""puppet"" effects seem today, coming after the newer prequels! This is unusual for me, as I have always gone on record as slamming CGI and always praising the ""old school"" of rendering offbeat characters (I still do); but after enjoying little Yoda as an animated being in REVENGE OF THE SITH and now seeing a less convincing ""prop"" of this character as originally realized for EMPIRE, I may just be starting to gain a slight new appreciation for some of the computer graphics. ***1/2 out of ****","

","ShootingShark","22 May 2005","The Star Wars saga continues as the Rebel heroes are forced to flee their new base on the ice planet of Hoth; Luke Skywalker travels to the swamp world of Dagobah to learn from Jedi master Yoda, whilst Han Solo and Princess Leia flee from Imperial pursuers to the cloud city of Bespin. The three are ultimately reunited, but with terrible consequences ...The sequel to George Lucas' Star Wars is that extremely rare thing - a sequel that is better than the original movie. Having created the fantastic universe and the cast of comic-book heroes in the first film, this movie is free to develop the characters, drama, humour and wildly imaginative worlds. It has a truly fantastic script (by Lawrence Kasdan and veteran screenwriter Leigh Brackett, from a story by Lucas) with an almost unique structure - there's no beginning, no ending and the story splits in two at the end of the third reel and then reunifies for the last two reels. It also redefines the use of special effects again, expanding on the eye-popping visuals of Star Wars with a breathtaking variety of dazzling shots. The opening battle sequence on Hoth (shot in Finse in Norway) is fabulous, with walking robot monsters pounding across glaciers to the strains of John Williams cracking score (his Imperial March theme is perhaps the most memorable of all his Star Wars music). The intimate scenes of Luke's Jedi training are just wonderful - Yoda is perfectly realised by puppeteer Oz - and the quasi-philosophy of the Force, brilliantly captured in a scene where Yoda rescues Luke's ship from the swamps, is profoundly moving. Equally stunning is the characterisation of Darth Vader, arguably the greatest screen villain of all time (and with the biggest, baddest killer spaceship ever); there is a fantastic moment where he uses his mind-control powers to invisibly throttle an incompetent general whilst simultaneously barking orders to another !! His unforgettable voice, supplied by the incomparable (and shockingly uncredited) Jones is one of the movie's great assets. The cast are uniformly terrific, throwing themselves into character with abandon - I particularly like Hamill's anguished heroism, Williams as the suave but slippery Lando Calrissian, and Colley as the twitchy Captain/Admiral Piett. The movie features brilliant production design by Norman Reynolds and photography by Peter Suschitzsky, but is simply top-notch in every aspect. An astonishingly brilliant sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made. This review is of the 1997 re-release, featuring some new effects shots (most notably in the scenes on Bespin) and a re-recorded version of a crucial scene with the Emperor, here played by an uncredited Ian McDiarmid (he was originally played by Clive Revill).","

The rest compared to that scene is pretty good, including Yoda's first appearance, Cloud City, and of course, ""I am your father."" It's interesting that this Irvin Kershner replaces George Lucas for the directing (I almost assumed Lucas directed all six films). Overall, the action scenes were great (the AT-AT scene being phenomenal), the acting was great, and I also thought some of the humor was better, especially with C-3PO.

","ametaphysicalshark","6 November 2008","No matter what you think 'defines' ""Star Wars""- the action sequences, the detailed and enthralling mythos, the memorable characters, the romance, or just the atmosphere of adventure, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is in just about every way the most rewarding viewing experience out of any of the six live action ""Star Wars"" films (I have not seen ""Clone Wars"" and don't intend to right now). Why? Because it pulls off what ""Revenge of the Sith"" failed at: creating a compelling and well-written character-driven story while still delivering plenty of action, humor, and remaining an homage to the serials of the 1930's and 40's. It's surprising that there remains debate over how right or wrong critics were on the film at the time of its release, when it received not negative nor very positive reviews, but mixed ones leaning towards the positive side, generally. Few critics initially recognized the superiority of this screenplay to the first film in the series, and not only its relative complexity but its richness in its allusions to and utilization of literature and films of the past to create its own unique mythos. It's hardly surprising, given that Leigh Brackett was involved in writing the screenplay, some of her greatest achievements in her film career being ""The Big Sleep"", ""The Long Goodbye"", and ""Rio Bravo"", all rich, detailed, and intelligent screenplays. Yes, attempting to argue that ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is an intelligent character-based film is fast becoming pointless; you're either preaching to the choir or attempting to convince those with the prequels fresh in their mind that ""Star Wars"" was, once upon a time, a franchise worthy of real praise. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" really does tell a compelling story, however, and it is compelling mostly because we really do care about Luke's journey, we do care about Han Solo, we love Chewie, we adore the banter between R2-D2 and C-3PO, and arguably most of all because Darth Vader isn't just a 'cool' villain, he's a genuinely interesting and compelling character (er, if you can keep Hayden Christensen out of mind). Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett have achieved something rare and special here, a grand Hollywood spectacle which can be analyzed and discussed at great length (which I'm definitely not going to do, if you're interested pick up one of the dozens, hundreds possibly, of books written on the subject, or just do a quick Google search) . It's a great screenplay. Not that there haven't been great screenplays let down by incompetent film-making in the past, but ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is certainly not an example of this. I'm sure ""Star Wars"" fans know much more about the making of this film and how much credit Irvin Kershner deserves for the end result than I do, but for this review I'll credit him with the quality of this film on a technical level. It's an improvement over the first film in many ways, as far as I'm concerned, especially the set design (which is more ambitious here), and the quality of the visuals and even the acting. ""Star Wars"" may have an opening scene and shot which remains magical to this day, but I'd argue that most of this film is memorable and enthralling, with only one or two scenes in the first half hour or so being just 'good'. The acting also improves notably, with the exception of Carrie Fisher (who really just isn't a good actor), Mark Hamill is arguably the most improved since the first film, really coming into his own as Luke Skywalker here, and even giving us one of cinema's few good 'NOOO!!!' moments. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" also introduces us to Yoda, of course, and I'm really surprised at how animated and expressive Yoda is (being, I'm pretty sure, a puppet at this point). The special effects in general are outstanding, outside of a couple of the creatures near the beginning of the film. It's not just that ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is an enthralling and exciting film, and an iconic one at that, but it really does work on a deeper level. No, I'm not saying that ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is some sort of immeasurably complex and subtle film, but what's impressive about it is that it offers spectacle and humor, but is also a genuinely compelling tale driven by its characters, primarily Luke. It's a great, great movie, and where ""Star Wars"" may fall just short of deserving the sort of praise it gets, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" really is a terrific movie and deserves all the praise it has received and will receive in the future. 9.5/10","

","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","5 July 2008","Where the first was an introduction to this vast universe, this is a further adventure in it, and an expansion of it. New worlds, creatures and technologies. Like its predecessor, this has something for everyone, and this is a stronger film... perhaps the most so, of the entire series. Kershner is undoubtedly at least part of the reason... he worked to make the characters realistic and credible beyond what they were, and it pays off. The various relationships are more believable than in the others, and the developments are very natural. This offers an emotional connection to the material, for the viewer, in addition to all the entertaining aspects. The plot remains interesting throughout and it never stands still. The pacing is spot-on, there isn't a boring moment in the two hour running time. The effects are impeccable, and Lucas had the crew push themselves to the limit, and it shows... big time. The score is yet again fantastic, Williams adds to what he created for IV. The acting is good, and seldom poor. The tone gets darker, setting up a sequel. The episode before this was a solid story even if it would be the only in the franchise, and this is a perfect middle part. This has by far the greatest light-saber action in the Original Trilogy. This is exciting and masterful with dialog and tension of high quality. The DVD features a commentary track well worth a listen, with several speakers, including Irvin. I recommend this to fans of Star Wars(regardless of what exactly you take that to mean), science fiction and movies. 10/10","

","hnt_dnl","29 March 2011","I so badly wish that I could say that the original STAR WARS:EPISODE IV,A NEW HOPE(ANH) was the best of the STAR WARS films, but it is, frankly, not! That honor goes to STAR WARS:EPISODE V,THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (ESB)(1980). ESB is that rare sequel that manages to top it's predecessor. Make no mistake, though, ANH is still as magical, pure, and fun a flick as it was in 1977 when I first saw it as a kid! But ESB ups the ante and succeeds in it's own depiction of the Star Wars universe. In reality, ESB is in basic tone the antithesis of ANH, which is a big reason why I think that BOTH films stand the test of time! If your in the mood for a fast-paced, imaginative adrenaline-rush of pure action-adventure, then pop in ANH! But if you want imagination combined with character depth and detail, mystery, mood, and atmosphere, then ESB is more your cup of tea! Mark Hamill (reprising the role that made him famous, Luke Skywalker) gets to show some acting chops in ESB, but he doesn't do a complete character 180, thankfully! Hamill still imbibes Luke with the same youthful vigor and eagerness, but with just a touch of more maturity as Luke is now a Jedi-in-training, preparing to take on the despicable Darth Vader (the iconic character created from the original, voiced by James Earl Jones and played by David Prowse). While in ANH, Vader had a smaller role (just force-choking snotty imperial officers and looking intimidating), here in ESB, Vader is a major player and more fleshed out and much scarier as he exudes menace and fear throughout the film.On the planet Dagobah with his trusty sidekick, the all-purpose droid R2D2, Luke's training in the arts of the Jedi Knights is led by, IMHO, the greatest character of ALL Star Wars films...drum roll, please?!....Master YODA! A brilliant puppet creation, created by Muppets creator Jim Henson and voiced by Frank Oz, Yoda has more personality and depth than most human characters I've ever seen in film! While Obi-Wan Kenobi (reprised by Sir Alec Guiness in a cameo role as a Force Ghost) laid the foundation for the Force in ANH, Yoda builds the house in ESB! Whatever this mystical ""Force"" is, Yoda makes you believe! My favorite scenes in ESB are between Luke and Yoda, on a swamp planet no less! Also returning are Harrison Ford (as the dashing rascal pilot Han Solo) and Carrie Fisher (as the feisty, forward Princess Leia). Navigating their way through asteroids and space monsters along with Han's Wookie sidekick Chewbacca and hilarious protocol droid C3P0, Han and Leia's story is told in parallel to Luke's as they all must go their separate ways to escape the wrath of the Empire until they can re-join the Rebel fleet. Ford and Fisher's natural chemistry shines through in ESB as Han and Leia bring out the best (and sometimes worst!) in each other in an enjoyable love-hate pairing.Surprising cast addition Billy Dee Williams also gives a convincing performance as Lando Calrissian, Han's old friend and leader of Cloud City Bespin, where Han and Leia seek temporary refuge from the Empire.While slower in storytelling and darker than it's predecessor, ESB still manages to entertain with a wonderful script, excellent acting, a provocative plot, and great action sequences, including the opening battle on the ice-planet Hoth, the asteroid scene, and concluding with an awesome light-saber showdown (probably the best in all the films) between Luke and Vader on Bespin. Given that it was made 30+ years ago, the special effects in ESB are still eye-popping and quite impressive. Interesting is that, George Lucas, the 'name' most associated with Star Wars, has very little to do with the result of this great film. It was directed by Irvin Kershner, written by Lawrence Kasdan, and scored by of course John Williams. Much more than a Star Wars film, ESB is a film classic!","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","TheUnknown837-1","10 February 2010","Having viewed both the theatrical and updated versions of the first ""Star Wars"" picture, my reaction is still the same: a mixed review with an ultimate marginal note of recommendation. Now I have sat down to watch back-to-back both the theatrical and updated versions of the second movie, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and my verdict is still unanimous on that one as well: this is one of the best science-fiction movies ever made and it still baffles me how critic John Simon could comprehend of saying that a movie this bold and imaginative and daring and thrilling is junk and is dehumanizing to the younger generation. It certainly isn't to me. And the reason why I primarily admire ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is not the fact that its special effects are first-class or that they are used with imagination, but that its dominated by a superb science-fiction story, memorable characters, smart dialogue, and a true foreboding and mysterious atmosphere totally alien to the cheerful opera-like personality of the first movie.""The Empire Strikes Back"" take place after the destruction of the Death Star. The Galactic Empire's command is now mainly controlled by the tremendously fearsome Darth Vader, who is vigorously hunting young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who is one of the leaders of the Rebellion. After a battle with the Empire, Luke and his friends are separated. While Han Solo and the others try to dodge Vader's pursuit, Luke lands on a mysterious planet where a little creature named Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) teaches him the ways of the Jedi.There is not a single weak element to ""The Empire Strikes Back."" But I think so many people miss out on what makes the picture so enthralling and wonderful. Everybody mentions the special effects and yes they are revolutionary and spectacular, but the skill and persuasiveness of the special effects is just two dimensions of their success. The third and most powerful dimension is the fact that they are used with imagination. Special effects are just a package order in Hollywood. But using imagination behind them cannot be bought and paid for, it takes the genius that these filmmakers possess. And the special effects are used to create a world. Just for example, the ice world of Hoth where the beginning takes place. It's not just that we see a big icy world that looks like a frozen planet, but that we see creatures and ecosystems. This is a world. Not a set. The costumes used for Chewbacca and C-3PO and the comical R2-D2 are effective as the models for spaceships, but the most astonishing effect is Yoda, who is nothing more than an animatronic creature controlled and voiced by Frank Oz, who expresses every emotion that a human actor can through his face and eyes and this puppet Yoda has more emotion than the CGI one that was found in the prequel trilogy.But what I admire most about this picture is the dark, moody atmosphere, which is quite rare for a science-fiction picture. Typically, the atmosphere is cheery or lighthearted, as in the first movie, but ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is darker, most nihilistic, mysterious, and somber. It's a violent picture. Kills and betrayals are not felt as moves in a chess game. The characters are three-dimensional, especially Han Solo and Darth Vader, who before was just a strong supporting presence, but here has evolved into one of the screen's most chilling villains. Before he mostly just stood around and hissed through his voice machine, now he really dominates the screen and drops our jaws.Comparing the theatrical version to George Lucas's updated version, which includes an extended scene of the Yeti-like monster that attacks Luke early in the picture, both are equal in their majesty. Which is better? Hard to say, but it's close. So if a person came up to me and asked me ""which version should I see?"" I'd answer, ""take your pick. You'll have the time of your life.""","

","benibkill","22 February 2022","This movie is the perfect example, on how to do a sequel right. This is easily the best Star Wars movie ever made. The action is much better and advanced, than in the pervious one. The villains are both amazing. Darth Vader established himself, as one of the most iconic villains of all time in this movie. The emotion is well implemented and it fits very nicely with the story. Lando Calrissian was a very neat addition to the group, which I very much enjoyed. Yoda was amazing in this movie as well. There is basically nothing to complain about. This is another one of the perfect movies.","

","educallejero","15 June 2020","The worst part of the movie were Chewbacca's excessive and excruciating howlings. That, plus the annoying (although less so) R2-D2 noises made the experience less pleasent for no reason (I guess kids love these things?).But beyond that this movie walked the fine line between childish and ""serious"" in impressive manner. The scripts is way better developing the story, the characters and their relationships, and even connecting all the subplots to the main plot at the end. The dialogue is still not great, but that was to be expected.Plus? We are introduced in much more detail to ""The Force"", expands the Universe to places beyond ""The Rebels"" and ""The Empire"", the score is still awesome and the action gets more diverse and less repetetive (although, it can get a bit boring here and there, it's not even close to the first one). Great sequel in fact.","

","ja_kitty_71","4 February 2010","I had gotten curious about the ""Star Wars"" saga. But I had bought the DVD collector's box-sets of both the original and the new prequel film trilogies. And after that, I love the ""Star Wars"" saga.Where we left off from the first film, Luke Skywalker and his rebel band had form a based on the frozen planet of Hoth. Luke was surveying the area, when suddenly he and his tauntaun got attacked and caught by a snow monster called a Wampa. At the rebel base, Han Solo was about to leave for Tatooine to pay back Jabba the Hut, when he heard that Luke hadn't come back; so he sets out to find him. Meanwhile, Luke manage to escape from the wampa; but he finds himself caught in a blizzard and collapses in the snow. Suddenly, he sees the Force ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi appear before him. Ben tells Luke to go to Dagobah to undergo training under Yoda, a Jedi Grand Master. After the spirit disappears, Han rides up to an almost unconscious Luke, who is mumbling indistinctly about Ben, Yoda and Dagobah. At this point, the tauntaun that Han was riding on collapses and dies from the extreme cold. To keep Luke warm during the blizzard, Han uses Luke's lightsaber to cut open the dead tauntaun and places Luke in it. Han then sets about erecting a shelter that he and Luke will stay in during the night, until a search party found them.At the base, Luke was recovering well. But a probe droid that was spying on the band, had found the base! Darth Vadar attacked the base and the rebels scattered. Luke (along with R2) headed for Dagobah, remembering Obi-wan's word. And Han, Leia, Chewie and 3PO headed for Bespin the City in the Clouds. Meanwhile on Dagobah, after a...not so good start, Luke found Yoda and begins his Jedi training. But during his training, Luke senses his friends are in danger on Bespin.Now he must go and save them. But Yoda urges Luke not to go, because it is just what the Sith wants - to lure Luke into the Dark Side. But Luke must go! And he promises Yoda he will come back to complete his training.That's all I could tell you folks, watch it and see how it ends. I think it is a great sequel to ""Episode IV: A New Hope."" And also I am a Leia/Han shipper","

","Padrion","28 January 2024","Yes, the first Star Wars film was a smash hit but would have been forgotten by now if they continued it with a bunch of rushed, lazy written, mediocre movies. Thankfully they didn't. In Fact the second entry to Lucas' science-fantasy saga is universally seen as even better then the already great first movie.Rightfully so I'd say because it expands the world building massively as well as the character development which was rather basic up to this point. Of course, effects and action scenes look dated by now but this doesn't really hurt the viewing experience all that much. The only valid criticism I can think of is that as the middle part of a trilogy it doesn't really work on its own. You obviously should watch these movies in order to really enjoy them.","

","Brennan_InterrogativeMan","15 October 2002","When The Empire Strikes Back was released for the first time, I didn't think it would be as good as the very first Star Wars that was released because usually a sequel isn't as good as a prequel. But boy was I ever wrong!!! In my opinion, I think that this is not only the best sequel, but the best movie ever made.Everthing about this movie is excellent, from the battle that's taken place on Hoth, to the climatic battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skwalker, where Luke finds out about his secret destiny.....This movie also introduces a new character named Yoda {who is about the size of a dachshund when it stands on 2 legs}. If you were to see Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of The Clones, you would find out why people in the Star Wars universe call him ""master"". I like the way he sounds like say fozzie bear from the muppet babies and his backwards spelling like, ""Powerful jedi, was he.""As I said with another review about ""Return Of The Jedi"", I owe it all to George Lucas. Without him, Star Wars wouldn't have been created. Thanks George Lucas!","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","Dannov747","27 June 2022","The Empire strikes back is a complex movie to review. On the one hand, in terms of plot development and pacing it feels like a step back from A New Hope. Luke goes to train with Yoda, while his friends evade a Star Destroyer through the power of plot armor. Eventually he goes to save his friends.However, it does a few things exceptionally well:1. Expand the world building of the original film. A New Hope was largely a fairy tale story which could stand on its own. But Empire Strikes back grounds it in a believable universe. The death star is gone, but that barely made a dent in the power of the Empire. The nature of the force is expanded on. The emperor is introduced. Darth Vader isnt just some random bad guy anymore.2. Subverting expectations done right. Structurally, the Empire Strikes back is kind of an odd movie, and its even more unique in that it ends on a pretty dark note. Luke going to save his friends doesn't really work at all. He instead gets his hand chopped off, almost dies and needs their help. But this subversion doesn't just come out of nowhere like a The Last Jedi gotcha, it actually makes sense.3. The plot twist at the end is so well known that people dont really factor it in when reviewing the story 40 years later. But keeping it in mind, this really would be a shocking moment to anyone watching it the first time.Also, with a better director at the helm, Empire Strikes back has better dialogue (slightly, its still not great), better acting, and better cinematography. John Williams even steps it up a notch with the music.Overall, the somewhat weak plot development (it spends far too much time in asteroid fields, a cheesy romance, and training montages), still makes me think its a bit overrated. But its still the best Star Wars movie.","

","jamie-wire","16 June 2003","For me, The Empire Strikes Back is one of the best films I have seen. It is the best of the five Star Wars films, though perhaps that is down to director Irvin Kershner who tweaked George Lucas's original vision into something darker than the original and infinitely bleaker than the follow-up Return of the Jedi. Lucas reportedly hated 'Empire' upon seeing what Kershner had done to his film and put together another cut that he later conceded was inferior, and Kershner's vision made it to screens around the world.***SPOILERS***The Empire Strikes Back serves as an interesting bridge between A New Hope and 'Jedi', introducing Force masters Yoda and the Emperor (the latter not yet played by the magnificent Ian McDiarmid who took on the role in Return of the Jedi three years later), while at the same time taking the original gang of characters and splitting them up in different directions, a scenario copied to the point of tedium by the Expanded Universe books.Based upon the 'classic trilogy', Darth Vader is one of cinema's greatest villains and perhaps it will take until the release of the sixth film in 2005 to be sure what effect the prequels will have had on that image. In 'A New Hope' we are introduced to a near-merciless killer  and his evil nature seems to have grown by the time of 'Empire'. One by one, incompetent underlings make their way to the Super Star Destroyer morgue as the Sith Lord searches for his prize. It isn't until 'Jedi' that we feel Vader to be human at all, despite the famous cliffhanger end to this film.
It's hard to define what this film means to me, other than alot. Hopefully the DVD is not be lightyears away. 10/10","

","Jonathan-Puntervold","16 November 2003","One of my seven 10s (of my about 200 rated movies) are given to this movie. And when I first wanted to vote for it, I had just seen it, yet again experienced the class, the acts, the dialogue, the action, the characters, the amazing adventures of Han, Luke and the rest. And let's just say that I hadn't seen it in years just before I voted. And a 10 sounded so, well, unreal, especially when you should actually presume that it's the original Star Wars which deserves a 10. If one of the movies should have one. But it was this one I found right. I still do. I am sure that this is the absolutely greatest adventure movie of all time. Of all Star Wars movies. Of the Indiana Jones movies. And of the Lord Of The Rings movies. Of every adventure movie I have seen, this one is the very best. Why, you will probably ask. Most people I know either prefer Star Wars IV or VI to this one. But I think they forget to take acquintance to the amazing chemistry there is between all the cast in this movie. And the classic scenes, there are many more than in the other movies. Luke meeting Yoda, and Yoda's amazing wisdom for such a small, little green alien. Vader confronts Luke. The truth revealed. Han and Leia's first kiss, and C-3POs interference. The introduction of Lando. Boba Fett. Admiral Piett's absurd rise to great Imperial stature. The battle of Hoth. Han frozen into carbonite. Just about everything of the dialogue, acting, everything of it is so classic, so climatic, so absolutely real. The Empire Strikes Back is the absolutely finest film in the entire Star Wars series. It's so intense, its plot and subplots are perfectly intertwined, just about everything in the film is perfectly fit for its genre. This is why this movie deserves a 10.","

","Angry_Arguer","17 August 2003","George Lucas doesn't understand religion.  He can never convey the concepts and theories of it (or the belief in it for that matter) to any extent. Hence, the best movie he directed is American Graffiti since it is not so concerned with making obvious subtexts.Lucas pretends to know philosophy in the Star Wars series, but he never embellishes on the gray area between his monolithic ""good"" and ""evil"" sides. That said, The Empire Strikes Back remains the best in the Star Wars series because Lucas lets the reigns of directing fall to someone who knows what they're doing.  Irvin Kerschner is not a talented or smart director, but he has more sense in his head than Lucas.  Lucas' head is stuck in Never Never Land so it is up to Kerschner to add sense to the movie.There is also the support of Lawrence Kasdan (before the man wound up making garbage like Dreamcatcher) and Leigh Brackett touch up his original story in order to remove unnecessary garbage.  As Pauline Kael put it, the movie is not concerned about the ""comic book hedonism"" of the original Star Wars. Return of the Jedi would emphasize what happens when Lucas gets his way (again) and hires out some poor sap to direct.  The level of concern about Yoda this time is not the same as the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi, smart move.The level of static shots, using just pans and tilts, are marvelous compared to the constant sense of motion that Star Wars wants to make.  It gets worse with Attack of the Clones and Phantom Menace.  The biggest factor is that the effects haven't aged.  The space scenes are elaborate, but not annoying, and John William's score aptly supports them.  Compare the asteroid pursuit here to the vastly inferior one in Episode II, the magic has faded with CGI.Overall, there are good movies and bad ones.  The Empire Strikes Back is not better than Star Wars, it is a quantum leap forward from it.  If any film in the series holds my record for ambition, execution, and presentation...this is it.  4 out of 5 stars.","

","bscrivener-50810","17 January 2016","The Empire Strikes Back is a 1980 epic space opera/space fantasy film directed by George Lucas and direct sequel to Star Wars. As a brief summary, The Empire Strikes Back is a classic example of a movie that the critics of the time got very wrong. Initially receiving mixed reviews and being slammed by some is nowadays considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time and the best Star Wars film overall...and its not hard to see why! The Empire Strikes Back continues on from the events of Star Wars revisiting the characters of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo. The Empire Strikes Back is known to be the much darker sequel, with much more character depth, vulnerability and emotion. Lucas continues to develop his beloved characters in all the right ways with the Han-Leia relationship, the more powerful feeling of friendship and of course the biggest, most shocking twist in cinematic history with Vader and Luke in the final act of the film. The Empire Strikes Back also continues to evolve the world introducing us to new places, new characters such as the legendary Jedi master, Yoda, improving the special effects and an even more beautiful soundtrack, provided by John Williams. The Empire Strikes Back is a perfect example of a sequel done right, equal and at times even better than the original. Epic battles, intense space chases, powerful emotional character development, shocking twists, thought-provoking ideas, themes and messages and finally groundbreaking sequences and special effects. In terms of flaws The Empire Strikes Back virtually has none whatsoever, other than an unfortunate twist which has had a negative response later on in the franchise, a few unnecessarily long scenes of Luke's training, and in my opinion a slightly weaker general plot than the original story. These however barely affect this near perfect masterpiece of a movie. 9/10","

","apstylianou","3 December 2015","The Empire Strikes Back is the most suspenseful, well-paced and most emotional entry of the Star Wars saga. It's the greatest of movie sequels and as far as it goes, it is everything a sequel to a great movie is supposed to be: a darker tone, more development with the characters, universe expanding with some new and greater additions and features.The perfect adventure telling story that continues from where it left off from and delved deeper into the characters we all know and love today and introduced bigger places in the galaxy far far away that George Lucas originally introduced to us. The action is stunning, the visuals still look ground-breaking today. Empire overall, is just the best movie sequel ever and I don't know if I can call it the best of the original trilogy because its a tough choice between the three of them, to me.But I still love The Empire Strikes Back so 10/10.","

","johnnyboyz","9 March 2019","In a 'post-classical' era, films are often quite simplistic - they are driven by high-concepts and childish premises; experiencing them is fragmented by tie-in merchandising and the like. They concentrate on action too much, substituting character psychology. Or so the argument goes in Bordwell & Thompson's 2006 book ""Film Art"" - whether or not you agree with any of this, there is no questioning Star Wars' role in facilitating it.""The Empire Strikes Back"" was the first sequel to the hugely successful 1977 blockbuster ""A New Hope"" - picking up where the other left off but, strangely, not really feeling like it does an awful lot to advance what we witnessed other than put its protagonist through a training regime and have his friends chased around space by some villains for 90 minutes. How far have things REALLY been advanced by the time this 1980 effort has finished, beyond a quaint love story and a jarring familial revelation?The film's opening act takes place on a barren, wintry planet called Hoth. Following the destruction of the Death Star at the end of Episode 4, a weapon capable of destroying a single planet in one foul strike, a military group known as 'the Rebels' retreat in the wake of an Empirical counter-attack, which involves despatching robotic probes to various parts of the galaxy to scout the potential positions. What everyone is fighting for, we still don't know. Later on, during a conversation about mineral mining in a visually impressive city built into the sky, it is inferred the fighting is to do with control of natural resources.When we first see the series' hero, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), on the surface of Hoth in a blizzard, he looks a little like an alien in his arctic gear complete with goggles and mouth-scarf - you might say he bears a passing resemblance to the film's villain, Darth Vader, whose jet-black helmet covers his entire face and gives him a similar un-human quality. Skywalker unfurls his coverings, looking far more grizzled than in the first film. We are then lulled into a false sense of security when ally Han Solo (Harrison Ford) confirms over a radio that the 'sensors' are in place. Job done, we conclude - but Luke is ambushed by a snow monster and dragged off to its cave.Not returning, and with Solo out there looking for him, the base takes the decision to close the main doors as the dark creeps in and the perishing cold become overwhelming. Cleverly, director Irvin Kershner focuses on the pained expression of Princes Leia (Carrie Fisher) as they shut - whose fate does she fear for the most? Luke's escape from the Yeti provides us with a tantalising early look at the power of the lightsaber, which takes the monster's arm clean off - an important detail for a later duel... But why does Luke then LEAVE the safety of the cave as the storm rages? Why did the film have him caught in the first place? Half-dying in the snow, he has a vision of dead friend Obi-wan (Alec Guinness) who tells him to seek ""Yoda"" on another planet so that he may complete Jedi training, but we know that Obi-wan can appear at any time to tell him this - Luke doesn't need to be on his last legs and think he's hallucinating.Eventually, one of those enemy probes passes by the base, but the Rebels mysteriously attack it when the plan was to maintain invisibility - why not just let it pass? Cover blown, the Empire attack - but are the Rebels evacuating the base or defending it? We're not sure. Irrespectively, the act ends when the Hoth fight ends - Solo; Leia; Chewbacca and a friendly robot named C3PO leave on Solo's ship whereas Skywalker departs to find Yoda with R2D2.From here, the film cuts into two halves: Luke's strand is slow, methodical and contemplative as he spends time on a jungle planet with a small green alien learning how to perfect abilities in 'the force', whereas Solo and the gang endure a more causality driven experience as Vader's ship pursues them through asteroid belts; the stomachs of giant worms and cities built into the clouds.What becomes curious about the film at this stage is that the antagonist, Vader, makes a conscious decision to pursue Skywalker not to kill him, but capture him so that they may join together as villains. In addition to this, an entire passage of the film beds said protagonist down in one place so that he may learn about patience; concentration and being contemplative - hardly things associated with 'post-classical' cinema. By today's standards, this is positively blockbuster revisionism. But surely there is a hole in Skywalker's training: is he not working towards wrecking a revenge on Vader? Isn't this contrary to the force's teachings?Solo's strand is more simplistic, more familiar to this post-Star Wars era blockbuster school: the bad-guys are chasing the good-guys; there is a meagre romance between Solo and Leia - royalty mingling with common-folk. Amusingly, Kershner uses a recurring gag to do with Solo's ship's power-thrust mechanic failing to roar into action when he needs it, and we grin at the metaphor. Strikingly, very little of any real interest happens on this strand which seems present to keep people amused as the other stuff plays out.I read and hear of people remarking how much 'darker' the film's tone is, and so it is better than IV, but I would disagree. Tonally, the films seem quite similar - certainly, the characters here are in hairier situations, but so what? It ends on more of a downbeat note, for Skywalker; Solo and even Vader, but does so in order to tee up the next film, not because its ending is in line with any kind of thematic it's exploring. How is one to conclude now, almost 40 years on from the changing of the cinematic guard? ""Empire..."" is functional, but perhaps undeserved of its status.","

The script, the directing, editing, special effects, everything is just head and shoulders better. This movie is also one of the first times in Hollywood history where the bad guys actually won. The movie superbly expands upon the original story-wise as well, the romance between Han and Leia is great, and the big revelation at the end of the film is probably the most shocking moment in film history.

","harryplinkett14","26 October 2019","This is no doubt the best of the three Star Wars films. I don't count the 'prequels' or recent 'sequels', spin-offs and such.The original film was lots of fun, but it was also trying to find out what it was, to establish a distinct tone, to define the universe it was played in, and so on. Also, a limited budget impacted the production in tangible ways. Now, for 'Empire', they had all these things in place. The characters were developed, the universe defined, the budget was there. Also, a better film director was employed this time around.The film further develops the characters, in most enjoyable and interesting ways. There is drama here, that neither the first nor the third film ever came close to. And the scenes on Hoth remain the most memorable for me personally.But there is a problem here: the exploration of the 'force'. It never went anywhere. It got bogged down in the swamps of Dagobah, and became incoherent drivel that seemed to randomly pick up elements from various philosophies. Yoda's teachings have all the depth of a 'How to find peace with the universe' booklet you can buy for a dollar. I hated Yoda and everything about him. When they realised they were dealing with quasi-philosophical nonsense, the filmmakers tried to compensate for it by making Yoda arrogant and pretentious, as he makes silly demands on his pupil. Also, the return of Obi Wan was annoying to me, and totally unnecessary. But another problem is created by turning Luke's training into his mess: he remains an alien character. We emote with Han, Leia, Chewie, and the droids, but not him. He never becomes intriguing or relevant for our emotional investment in the film. Until the end of the third film, he remains this alien figure that exists to push forward the plot about the 'force', while everything truly interesting and emotionally engaging revolves around the other protagonists. His confrontations with Vader remain sterile and feel like something the film is obligated to deliver, but no one truly enjoys. When I was a kid, I wanted to be Han Solo. Luke never became a hero, and nothing he ever did moved me the way the adventures of Han and the other protagonists did.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","Greg Sanderson","22 October 2001","In creating a sequel to the phenomenally successful Star Wars, George Lucas and his team were faced with a seemingly impossible challenge.  How could the original be surpassed?  Three years (and a lot of cash) had, of course, given the film-makers the opportunity to develop the special effects technology far beyond the original film.  But this alone was not enough. Where Empire truly excels over it's predecessor is in the two essential fields of film storytelling-- both the plot and the characters are far richer and more captivating.  Why is Empire the greatest film ever made? We will never again see such a perfect blending of romance, adventure, emotion and movie magic.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","studioAT","17 November 2015","Empire Strikes Back is widely called the best Star Wars film (to date) and it is clear to see why.It certainly contains lots of the iconic moments from the series and all the best lines. Hamill, Fisher and Ford all have eased into their lead roles and there is enough action for them all to be involved, even if after the first act they don't spend much time together.Whereas 'A New Hope' had a sluggish start this second film in the original trilogy opens with action and never really lets up after that. There are great fight scenes and technical effects that more than make up for the moments where it all gets a bit sci-fi jargon heavy.Is this the best Star Wars film, the one for future films to beat? Possibly.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","tyrantlizardthad","25 August 2021","Empire Strikes Back is highly regarded as a masterpiece and one of the best sequels ever made, and it deserves all of the praise it gets. After all this time, it's still one of the best Star Wars movies to date and the best of the original trilogy.The opening Hoth sequence is extremely tense, dramatic, well-paced, and explosive. The cold environment works as a great way to show how much darker and grim this film is going to be. Luke's training with Yoda on Dagobah is awe-inspiring and this subplot has a ton of character development. We learn much more about the force and what it truly means to be a Jedi, Luke's character flaws are explored, and we get more hints and Obi-Wan and Vader's past. The Empire chasing the Millennium Falcon is intense and suspenseful. Darth Vader's fearsome presence and brutal executions give chills. Lando's betrayal and Han being frozen in Carbonite is impactful. Vader and Luke's lightsaber duel is one of the finest, most brutal and nail-biting fights in all of Star Wars, and Vader's reveal that he is Luke's father is powerful. The entire movie is an immensely thrilling and entertaining ride.All of the performances are top notch, and so is the character development and dialogue. We get to see Luke learning how to become a Jedi and a deep exploration of his character flaws, Han and Leia fall in love (while Han continues to be his awesome witty self), Leia opens herself up to relationships, and Vader gets a lot more screentime in this one. We see more of how ruthless, passionate, hateful, terrifying, and selfish he is, all of which make him such a great Sith, but also a small bit of his softer side at the end when he speaks with Luke through the force, foreshadowing his change in Return of the Jedi. We are also introduced to Yoda, who is an inspiring and unique mentor figure, and the puppet used to portray him has aged quite well in it's execution.Speaking of which, like the entire original trilogy, the special effects are stunning and groundbreaking, with lots of astounding practical sets, puppets, animatronics and miniatures and gorgeous green screen and matte shots (though in terms of the latter two, these haven't aged the best, but they were top notch for their time). And finally, John Williams continues to outdo himself with the amazing, exhilarating musical score. This movie introduced the Imperial March, perhaps the best villain theme in cinema history.A definite masterpiece all around.","

"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","diac228","2 October 2009","Prior to 1980, there had not been a movie sequel that quite destroyed over dethroned the original in terms of quality, cultural impact, and everlasting effect. Ever since 1916, when the first movie sequel was born (Fall of a Nation---completing your pointless trivia of the day), there had been very few successful sequels that could stand tall with the original. Of course, there was French Connection II, and Godfather II, but neither of them could quite compare to the original. Enter Empire Strikes Back. Not only did this sequel have a tougher job to live to its original counterpart (a box office phenomenon that would forever change marketing, merchandising, and film-making for generations to come), but this sequel quite frankly did the unthinkable by changing the tone, raising the stakes, and not promising a happy-go-lucky ending that usually associates with sequels. Empire Strikes Back is yet another Star Wars movie that broke the rules of how to make a film and also ushered a new style and technique of film-making.This movie didn't have the expected ending. Not all the backstories and main stories reached a resolution. The bad guys did win. The good guys were doomed. This sort of stuff doesn't happen in blockbuster sequels, but Empire Strikes Back dared to do this. Accompanying the change in pace is an excellent score, superb directing, incredible action, top-notch special effects, and basically the complete package in entertainment. The blend of action, drama, suspense, romance, and humor is among the best you'll ever see in a movie. Not only is it one of the best sequels ever, but it's also one of the greatest movies ever. This sort of movie-making magic just can't be duplicated.Empire Strikes Back is about the travels of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo (Mark Hamill, Carrie Fischer, Harrison Ford) as they suddenly encounter a massive resistance coming from the Dark Side of the force. Led by an angrier and less sympathetic Darth Vader, the rebels are suddenly faster, swifter, and smarter in their attempt to control the universe. At the same time, Luke begins his training to become a Jedi knight, only to have his training stalled when the conflict is becoming increasingly dangerous to all his friends. While it is obvious George Lucas didn't have every detail planned out in the trilogy (Example: Leia/Luke/Han love triangle), he had a grand idea as to where the franchise was going story-wise.The strongest part of Empire Strikes Back is like that of the original: the special effects and the associating visual spectacles that transports you to a totally different universe. The film was larger-than-life, as every location is grander and more impressive than the last: beginning with Hoth (and its classic snow battle) and ending with Bespin. While this was Lucas' creation and story, we cannot forget the directing of Irvin Kershner, which was the best of the entire franchise. Thanks to him, the acting here was best, the surprises were best-hidden, and the pacing was at its peak. The two hours breeze by here, and is capped by one of the strongest finishes in any blockbuster movie.All of your regular characters were back and were at their most entertaining here: Han Solo is at his cockiest and funniest in the second installment, Luke Skywalker is at his most heroic (and most foolish), 3-CPO is at his funniest (and most irritating), and then Darth Vader is at his downright scariest. When Luke has to fight him, the only hint of sheer terror in the trilogy occurs then—as Darth Vader pretty much tosses him around like an unwanted ragdoll. Adding to the fear is John Williams' immortal imperial march song, which makes its debut here. The rest of the music in this movie is also spectacular, and should have won the Oscar that year.Bottom Line: This is one of the top sequels of all-time, because it separates itself from the original by changing the tone, and expanding (and improving) upon everything that make the original Star Wars so great: the writing, special effects, directing, costumes, blend of action and comedy, set design, characters, musical score, pacing, and overall fun. Empire Strikes Back outperforms the original Star Wars in every aspect; from the better first act to even the smaller things like the lightsaber dueling choreography. It would be years before we find a blockbuster sequel that can top the original, and that's Terminator 2 which doesn't occur until the next decade.Like I've said about Star Wars, if you have not seen this movie, it's because you are trying so hard to avoid it. If you don't like this movie, then it's because you just don't enjoy good movie-making. Empire Strikes Back is one of those rare movies that can be wholesomely entertaining yet engrossingly deep at the same time. This is borderline-art, and is a sheer joy from the first minute to the last. The Empire Strikes Back: raising the bar for blockbusters and sequels everywhere---too bad there's been so few of them that have matched the same level of quality.",NA

","tastyhotdogs","30 December 2005","As a youngster certain parts of this movie creeped me (training with Yoda, the opening) but as I've matured, or at least got older, this now is easily my favourite movie of the series.The story obviously continues on from Star Wars, with the Rebels trying to defeat the Dark Side and Luke furthering his new career as a Jedi Knight. The movie takes us to Cloud City, one of the best destinations in the series, where we meet the coolest character in the franchise- Lando Calrissian, played brilliantly by Billy Dee Williams. We also see some brilliant battle scenes up here, including the face-off between Luke and Darth Vader.I won't say much more about it, but this episode to me is clearly the best- the best writing, the best story, the best dialogue and the best action.",NA

","TheBabblingFool","16 August 2002","This film is without a doubt the worst of the Star Wars movies. I have no idea why people say that this is the best. Watching Episode 5 is watching a really really good movie...then the ending destroys it from being supurb.The film is bigger and has better qualities than the first. It really develops the characters. Han Solo and Princess Leia's off and on love story is very entertaining. Yoda, one of the best Star Wars characters, is introduced, and begins to enlighten Luke on the ways of a Jedi, something we really only heard about in Episode 4.Episode 5 is chock full of excellent special effects (for it's time), the ice planet Hoth is one of my favorite worlds in the Star Wars universe.Everything in this film is better than the first, the acting, the plot, the action. Then it all crashes with the ending...which is so abrupt it's like they just ran out of film that they had to cut it short. I mean they treated it like a TV show, leaving all of the characters in the middle of action and saying ""Tune in next week, same Star Wars time, same Star Wars channel!"" This all leads to them having to finish what they started in Episode 5 in the first 30 or so minutes of Episode 6, giving less time to develop the plot in Episode 6. In the end this is a good movie, bigger than the first, but unless you have enough time to watch it back to back with Return of the Jedi, I can't really recommend it, because it just feels unfinished to me.",NA

","Ruskington","1 June 2020","Not for the life of me do I understand how people think this is better than its predecessor. Yes it has its moments but there is a distinct drop in quality, not least when it comes to the special effects. At times it looks like watching a close up of toy spaceships being moved around on fishing wire.The development of Skywalker is poor throughout these films and is particularly bad here. His progression from outer-galactic farmhand to Jedi Knight is laughably far-fetched and just doesn't seem feasible. His tutelage under Yoda is under-done and the use of 'The Force' as a plot band-aid is tiresome and insincere, a clear example of Lucas' often childish writing.The battle scenes were poor in A New Hope but get even worse in Empire Strikes Back. Very poor choreography and, even for 1980, pretty amateurish special effects. Did people really find the battle between Skywalker and Vader in any way engaging? I honestly just don't get it.There is plenty to admire about this film and it's certainly not the worst sequel ever made but a classic it is surely not.",NA

","ashdoginc","1 February 2021","This review is for the 1980 theatrical release and not the 1997 and later specialized editions.This movie really did push movie making when it was released in 1980. The special effects, performances and story are breath taking. It doesn't look too much to existing myths for inspiration but rather in creating its own lore. It takes the Force, the darkside, the lightside, the Jedi and explores them and expands on them to make a more deeper film. Yet it still maintains a sense of humor.
The film has aged remarkably well, it is a beautiful movie from start to finish. While the original Star wars may have revolutionized cinema, the Empire Strikes Back perfected it. It proved that pop culture can be every bit as good as any drama or period piece. I wouldn't hesitate to put it as a contender as the greatest movie ever made.

The exotic names and grotesque creatures become hard to digest after a while. Lightsaber duels afford opportunities to doze. I saw this movie because I saw the one before it.

Hoth was great but did not see why we had to spend first ten mins watching Luke get captured by the yeti type monster. The chase in the asteroid field was all a bit yawn.
