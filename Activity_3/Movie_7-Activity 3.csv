"Smells_Like_Cheese","1 November 2004","Man, I can not get this film out of my head. It is so rare that a movie can affect me the way ""The Pianst"" did. The last movie that did that was ""Casino"". I was really tired when I was watching the movie. It was almost midnight, so I was thinking that I'll start watching and I'll finish it in the morning. Did I? No, indeed I did not stop watching. I couldn't stop it. I just wanted to see what would happen next. I cried during ""Schindler's List"", I sobbed in this film. Everything that happens in this film is so sad. Adrien Brody does a remarkable job of acting in this film. I would very highly recommend this film. Especially if you are a history buff. Please, I think this film should be in the top 10 best films of all time.I looked on the message boards you know and some other user comments that didn't enjoy this film much, they criticized Adrien Brody's performance and say that he was boring and only showed emotions that are easy to act. Please, you have got to be kidding me. This man portrayed the total feeling of hopelessness, being alone, being hated. I one time had an audition in high school like this to see if I could improvise, and the way I imagined this feeling is like in dodgeball where you have no one else on your team and you're the only one left standing, yet on the other team there is 20 big men that are just waiting to wack that ball at you. Adrien couldn't have done a better job, I was so frightened for him and cried for him during the whole film while he was one the run.Roman Polanski as the director, he himself escaped the terrors of being a prisoner in The Holocaust, yet he lost his mother and other family members. Yes, I'm sure this film must have been hard to re create for him, but he was probably the only director that could have done this movie as brilliantly as he did. He created this story and made it so effective, I called up my mom and told her that I loved her so much because we take so many things for granted. True, this isn't the 1930's or 40's, and we are in America. But it's still frightening to think that human beings are capable of that much hate and being so brutal to another human. World War II is one of the most frightening wars in history, if you read more about The Holocaust, you get more into it and you should. If you are not interested, then watch this film. It's a must see, otherwise how else will we learn from our mistakes? The Pianist is a beautiful and extremely dark tale about a man and the struggle to survive. The ending is so powerful and moving to know that sometimes one man can make a difference in a crowd of so many and I'm not talking about Adrien Brody's character. You'll see what I mean.10/10","

"Fella_shibby","9 September 2013","This is a truly heart-wrenching story of one man whose family gets perished in the Holocaust and about his survival over solitude, deprivation, starvation and terror while in hiding during the Nazi occupation. In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust. This movie came close to Schindlers list in depicting the horrors of Holocaust. Brody puts in a marvelous and utterly touching performance. The story depicts the emotional and cultural breakdown of persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them. Excellent acting by Brody.","

"baumer","27 March 2003","I can remember when this film came out I was adamantly against seeing it. I had my preconceived notions that it would be some other heroic Jewish Holocaust film where good triumphs over evil and in between we would see some brutal atrocities committed by the Germans to add some flavour.How wrong I was.This is one of the best films I have ever seen and what it did to me I cannot describe in words. But in a nutshell, it moved me, made me cry, made me feel like I was in the Polish ghetto in 1940, and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as I walked out of the theater and thanked God that I live in the free society that I do. Roman Polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby but this is his crowning achievement. I think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years Oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film. I believe that the Oscar's are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else, so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year, it tells you that it should have won best picture but the Weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone, hence a charlatan like Chicago takes top prize. Sorry for the digression here but when you compare a ""film"" like Chicago to a masterpiece like The Pianist, there really is one clear cut winner. They handed out the statue to the wrong movie.The Pianist follows up and coming piano player Wlad Spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos, surviving only by the kindness of strangers. I think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because Spielzman is a man that we can all relate to. He is not a hero, he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge. He is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. He is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can. Only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide. And this is how I related to him. If put in his position, how would I react? Exactly the way he did. This is a man that had everything taken from him. His livelihood, his family, his freedom and almost his life. There is no time for heroics here. Adrien Brody embodies the spirit of Spielzman and his win at this years Oscars was one of the happiest moments I have had watching the festivities. His speech was even better but that is a topic for another time.Ultimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the German soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes I've witnessed. With very little dialogue, it is in the eyes, the face, the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know. I think it is this scene that won Brody his Oscar. This is one of the all time great performances.I think Polanski spoke from the heart here. He has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other. I think The Pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done, Chicago will be forgotten the way Ordinary People was forgotten and when people talk about the film The Pianist, they will do so with reverence and respect. This is a cinematic masterpiece.10 out of 10","

"FilmOtaku","28 April 2003","The Pianist is the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, at the time Poland's most acclaimed pianist whose life is transformed during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw beginning in 1939.  The film spans several years and maps his many personal trials in addition to providing the perspectives of his family, rebel factions and sympathizers.Brilliantly directed by Roman Polanski and starring an amazing Adrien Brody, The Pianist is bound to garner comparisons to Schindler's List, for obvious reasons.  However similar the subject matter, the approach is different. While Schindler's List was filmed in a beautiful, crisp black and white that offered many incredible images, The Pianist was filmed with almost muted color.  Schindler's List featured what has been argued as a complicated hero.  Oskar Schindler did save many Jews, but not without battling his own materialistic demons first.  The Pianist's Szpilman is a sympathetic character throughout.  His plight was desperate, and the demons he fought were over his own guilt in surviving a fight that eventually turns into a primal will to live.Polanski does not spare the viewer any grief with his film.  The horrific scenes between the Nazis and the Warsaw Jews were more terrifying and horrible than any horror/suspense movie I have seen in some time, possibly ever.  The humiliation and complete loss is wrenching.  In several scenes, Jews are lined up in the middle of the night and subjected to either torture or death.  In one case, a woman asks of a Nazi officer, ""What will happen to us?"" and is promptly shot point blank in the head.  The camera does not flinch or subdue any of these atrocities.A mention must be made of Brody's performance.  Having only previously seen Brody in two other films, Spike Lee's ""Summer of Sam"" and Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" (a part that was supposed to be his launch into stardom before his part was unfortunately cut drastically) I knew his potential was great.  After his Oscar win, I viewed this movie with more criticism than I normally would have and he certainly did not disappoint.  He transcended my expectations.  His physical transformation was amazing, but more importantly, he conveyed the sorrow of this man shockingly well - in both verbal and non-verbal contexts.  It will be very interesting to see what kind of opportunities this role will afford him, and the kinds of roles he will accept.Something worth mentioning is the affect this movie had on the audience with whom I viewed this film.  Normally, when a film ends, the regular hardcore filmsters like myself will stay and watch the credits in their entirety. The rest of the audience stands up and leaves, usually to the chagrin of the remaining enthusiasts.  This was one of the few times I have seen a film at a theater where not one person stood to leave during the final credits. It wasn't until the house lights came up at the end did people begin to disperse.  Personally, I hightailed it out of the theater the second the lights came on because not only was my face a mess from crying during the film (Tammy Faye comes to mind) but I had this overwhelming need for an emotional release, so when I reached my car I sat and wept for about five minutes.  It has been years since I have watched a film that upset me to that extent. Conversely, while discussing this film with my brother, (someone who loves movies as much and has similar tastes as I do) he mentioned that while he thought the movie was excellent, he wasn't as profoundly emotionally effected as I was.  After thinking about this for a couple of days, I realized the difference: The music.  As a classical music enthusiast and erstwhile musician, the thought of not being able to enjoy, much less play the music you love is a tragic one.  Then the emotional outpouring that comes when you return to it - there aren't words to describe how intense that is.  Not having the same appreciation for this musical genre, one will be able to sympathize with the physical and emotional tribulations, but perhaps not in the musical sense.The Pianist was truly an astonishing film.  I was riveted from start to finish and so emotionally affected that I couldn't even consider writing a review until a week later.  Having said that, I am filing this away with my list of movies which include Schindlers List and Philadelphia, as films that I love but cannot rewatch for a long time after due to their intensely emotional content.--Shelly","

"jotix100","21 January 2003","The Pianist is an incredible film in many aspects. Roman Polanski's account of the survival of the pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is a document about how one man can overcome the worst possible situations in a world gone completely mad around him.The only fault one can find with the adaptation of Mr. Szpilman's story by playwright Ronald Harwood, is the fact that we never get to know the real Wladyslaw Szpilman, the man, as some of the comments made to this forum also have indicated.There is a very interesting point raised by the the pianist's father who upon reading something in the paper, comments about how the Americans have forgotten them. Well, not only the Americans, but the rest of the world would not raise a finger to do anything for the people that were being imprisoned and made to live in the confined area of Warsaw. The exterminating camps will come later. What is amazing in the film, is the frankness in which director Polanski portrays the duplicity of some Jews in the ghetto. The fact that Jews were used to control other Jews is mind boggling, but it was a fact, and it's treated here matter of factly. Had this been made by an American director, this aspect would have never surfaced at all. Yet, Mr. Polanski and Mr. Harewood show us that all was not as noble and dignified as some other films have treated this ugly side of war.  Wladyslaw Szpilman, as played by Adrien Brody, is puzzling sometimes, in that we never get to know what's in his mind. He's a man intent in not dying, but he's not a fighter. He accepts the kindness extended to him. He never offers to do anything other than keep on hiding, which is a human instinct. He will never fight side by side with the real heroes of the ghetto uprising. His role is simply to witness the battle from his vantage point in one of the safe houses across the street from where the action takes place.Adrien Brody is an interesting actor to watch. As the pianist of the story he exudes intelligence. There is a scene where Szpilman, in one of the safe houses he is taken, discovers an upright piano. One can see the music in his head and he can't contain himself in moving his fingers outside the closed instrument playing the glorious music from which he can only imagine what it will sound in his mind.The supporting cast is excellent. Frank Findlay, a magnificent English actor is the father of the pianist and Maureen Lipman, another veteran of the stage, plays the mother with refined dignity.In watching this film one can only shudder at the thought of another conflict that is currently brewing in front of our eyes. We wonder if the leaders of the different factions could be made to sit through a showing of The Pianist to make them realize that war is hell.","

"classicsoncall","3 February 2013","Fortunately, I'm able to keep my personal feelings about Roman Polanski compartmentalized enough to say that this was a remarkable film. I've read many comparisons between ""The Pianist"" and ""Schindler's List"" on this board, and even though the films are quite different, the overpowering portrayals of Man's inhumanity against Man will leave the viewer forever affected. Adrien Brody's Best Actor award was stunningly achieved here, as his character arcs through an incredible series of circumstances to barely survive life in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II. What little I knew of director Polanski outside of his marriage to Sharon Tate, the grisly Manson murders, and his rape conviction in the late 1970's, was put into an entirely different perspective when I learned about his own life in the Polish Ghetto. Much of what we see in the film must emanate from his own unique experience as a child during the War and experiencing Nazi atrocity first hand. I don't envy anyone who survived that experience enduring the painful daily memories of those times.Given the film's title, I guess I was somewhat surprised by the paucity of musical sequences, though what was offered was artistically presented. Particularly poignant was the scene when Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) was left to hide in an apartment where a piano was available, and he mimed his way through a selection from memory by the need to maintain silence.Many years following the end of World War II, a single film cannister simply marked ""The Ghetto"" was discovered, revealing valuable insight into how the Nazi propaganda machine attempted to manipulate public opinion about 'rich' Jews who lived in luxury alongside fellow Jews in squalid conditions. Even more intimate details of life in the Warsaw Ghetto are presented in ""Shtikat Haarchion"" (A Film Unfinished), describing conditions that are even more horrific than those depicted in ""The Pianist"" or ""Schindler's List"", if that can even be imagined. These movies exist for a higher calling as a constant reminder that the term ""Never Again"" be one to constantly take seriously in an ever increasingly dangerous world.","

"Quinoa1984","16 January 2003","The Pianist tells the story of such a man in war time Poland, played by Adrien Brody, who from start to finish sees his life literally getting worse and worse and worse- starts off with new rules from the Nazis, then the stars on the arms, followed by the Warsaw ghetto, and while there he could play in the restaurant, that too soon ended, as the trains arrived and took his family and anyone else he knew away.  During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  This is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).In conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski's best, a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or.  Great music too. A+","

"dtb","9 January 2004","This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :-) -- rightly so, since title character Wladyslaw Szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways!  It's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off.  It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away.  (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there's no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest `safe house' has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head.  Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I've seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD's flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody's job often was), I'd be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won! (Besides, the rest of the 2002 Best Actor nominees already won Oscars -- this time it was dark horse Brody's turn! :-)","

"Nazi_Fighter_David","6 September 2005","'The Pianist' is definitively an inspiring epic that celebrates the tenacity and fortitude of the human spirit... It is a remarkable tale of human survival sensitively brought to life by Polanski... The film carries us to the horrible reign of terror, where condemned people wearing the emblem of humiliation and oppression, are deprived of their rights, their human values and dignity, before being shipped to 'labor camps.' In Polanski's movie all the conventional elements of the drama are at peaks of excellence: Family union: When a father has to bargain to buy a single piece of caramel and divide it in six pieces to share it with each member of his family...Starvation: When a ghetto inhabitant assaults a helpless woman for a bowl of soup... Confusion: When a distraught woman wails on a platform because she smothered the cries of her baby with her hand...Love: When a young musician turns to his younger sister and utters with sad regret, ""I wish I knew you better."" Survival: When one man observes the war through his hide-outs around the city...Cruelty: When an old man in a wheelchair is thrown off the balcony by the Nazis because he failed to stand upon their entrance...Fear: When a talented musician sits down at the old piano, and pretends to play his music, keeping his fingers flowing with control above the vertical ivories...Discrimination: When bored Nazi guards entertain themselves by forcing grotesquely mismatched old and sick couples to dance to a Jewish street band by the ghetto gate...Horror: When condemned Jewish workers lie face-down in the street, while one SS guard walks down the line, shooting without remorse each one in the back of the head... Isolation: When a fugitive emerges from his harrowing hiding place and walks through a field of deserted ruins exactly like the last man alive on Polish soil..Adrien Brody gives an absolutely moving performance (based on descriptive facial expressions) as the Polish composer and pianist who stays alive as a Jew, and remains true to his ideals... Brody captures the character's desperation, his anger and grief, his willpower and perseverance, his passion and love of music... Polanski gives us the chance to better know his shock and disbelief, his ordeal and tragedy, his hope for fairness and humanity...Nominated for seven Academy Awards, this captivating drama went on to win three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay... Once Brody took the stage to accept his Oscar, he was so overwhelmed with happiness, that he swept the gorgeous Academy Award-winning Halle Berry off her feet with a long, steamy kiss...","

"baba44713","7 April 2005","I remember seeing ""Schindler's list"" about ten years ago, and I remember how weird I felt for being almost completely unmoved by it. Although it showed the horrors of holocaust quite realistically, somehow it all seemed just a bit too fake and exaggerated. Characters were a bit off (I still can't decide who was more over the top, Schindler or Goeth), fake sentimentalism was all over the place, . While it was a work of art and an important reminder of true events that shouldn't be forgotten, on emotional level it just somehow failed to deliver.Enter ""The Pianist"". With no Spielberg around to put his trademark sappy material, we finally have a movie that shows the true horror and tragedy of Jewish people in World War II. The story is told through the eyes of one man - Wladislaw Szpielman, Jewish pianist who works in a radio station in Warsaw during the German occupation of Poland. Together with him we watch his world getting torn apart, witness his family being taken away, his existence being reduced to bare essentials. Brody gives a subtle yet spectacular performance, his best work yet. And never once are we reminded that we are watching a movie. Everything is shown from Szpielman's point of view, and it is all very gritty and realistic. While Spielberg's rendition of German atrocities always had a slightly staged feel to augment their dramatic purpose, here they are so true to life there impact is much greater - you watch and are being reminded in horror that this things actually happened.While being very hard to watch sometimes, this is a movie that ""Schindler's List"" was supposed to be. This movie doesn't judge anybody, or tries to explain anything - it shows historical events as a reflection of one man's fate, making a powerful testimony that stays with you long after the beautiful last shot and the end credits are over.","

"Xanan","20 January 2003","The Pianist is an account of the true life experience of a Polish pianist during WW2, in the context of the deportation of the Jewish community to the Ghetto of Warsaw, a setting virtually absent from all films inspired on WW2.
Polanski (himself a child survivor of the Krakow and Warsaw ghettos) could have described in more detail the legendary, desperate fighting of the Jewish resistance in the ghetto of Warsaw, or the horrific mass extermination in concentration camps. Instead, the film gains in intensity by displaying the war from the pianist's own point of view (through windows, half-opened doors, holes in the walls - with big emphasis on the use of ""point of view shooting"" by the cameraman). One cannot help feeling disturbed by the most enthralling scenes of the film, as the isolated pianist tries to ensure his survival in the ghetto and ruins of Warsaw, hiding and fleeing, moving from one bombed house to the next, gradually becoming a shadow of his former self, hungry and afraid (merit largely attributed to the extraordinary performance by Adrien Brody, who visibly loses half of his weight throughout the film).Does the pianist raise any sympathy from the audience? Not immediately, in my view. The pianist is more than often a drifting character, almost a witness of other people's and his own horrors. He seems to float and drift along the film like a lost feather, with people quickly appearing and disappearing from his life, some helping generously, others taking advantage of his quiet despair, always maintaining an almost blank, dispassionate demeanour. One may even wonder why we should care in the least about this character. But we do care. That is, I believe, the secret to this film's poetry.In one of the strongest scenes, towards the end, a German officer forces the pianist to play for his life, in an episode that suddenly brings a much lighter, beautifully poetic shade to the film (this German officer will be probably compared to Schindler, although his philanthropy does not quite share the same basis).This is also a wonderful tribute to Polish artists, through Chopin's music, with the concert at the very end of the film and the opening performance by the pianist at the local radio station (with the sound of bomb explosions in the background) forming an harmonious link between the beginning and end of the film (following Polanski's usual story-frame).Overall, The Pianist is one of the most detailed and shocking accounts of the treatment of the Jews by the Nazis, with the atmosphere in Warsaw well captured and believable. Quite possibly, The Pianist will remain in the history of film-making as the most touching and realistic portraits of the holocaust ever made.Polanski's film deserves a strong presence in the 2003 Oscar nominations, including a nomination for Adrien Brody's amazing performance, Polanski's sublime direction, best adapted screenplay and, obviously, best picture. This could be, at last, Polanski's long awaited, triumphal comeback to the high and mighty Hollywood.","

"Hitchcoc","10 September 2009","There have been so many fine films that deal with the Holocaust. Each shows the atrocities of the Germans, their random cruelty, their ruthlessness. This film has all that, but it also has Adrien Brody. This is a film that gets us inside the human being, the person who must run, whose iron will propels him forward. The thing is, though, he is not necessarily a hero in the traditional sense. We sense the fatigue of his character as he runs from situation to situation, just trying to stay alive. There are good people around him, many are good Germans. While we watch people shot in the head, beaten to the ground, mutilated, we see him moving aimlessly toward something (the thing is we don't know what that something is). He hears rumors about the Russians liberating Poland but he can't let up for a second. He watches as the underground makes sacrifice after sacrifice, their building burned, their people sent up in flames. He sees himself as a coward. He thinks about being dead, but his will to live drives him on. The title, of course, is him--the pianist--a nationally known classical pianist, suddenly dehumanized. We see his weaknesses and his strengths. We also get a more balanced though terrifying view of the situation in the Polish ghetto. This is a film we should all see.","

"Leofwine_draca","19 April 2017","THE PIANIST is a film that takes a dark and disturbing subject matter - the persecution of the Warsaw Jews by Nazis in the Second World War - and turns it into a spellbinding, enthralling journey of a movie. Roman Polanski could easily have made this maudlin and sentimental like Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST, but he thankfully avoids that temptation and the result is the much better movie of the two.This film contains a documentary-style realism in its depiction of the various atrocities carried out by the uncaring Germans. It gets dark and darker as it goes on, and yet the viewer is unable to tear his eyes off the screen because it's all so well-realised and realistic. Adrien Brody plays the eyes and ears of the viewer in a subdued manner, yet delivers his greatest and most believable performance as a result. The story has a lot of darkness and violence, but Polanski's expert camera-work and endless style stops the subject matter ever becoming depressing; instead there's enough tension to keep you involved and wanting to find out what's next. Things build to a suitably touching and poignant climax that doesn't disappoint.","

"ashcoounter","1 February 2003","Polanski has depicted the gory details of the holocaust without much restraint. But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.Every single act of escapade Szpilman goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.Overall, Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.Pawel Edelman's camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.Hervé de Luze's editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.The scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.Great film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars. I will give it a 9 Out of 10.","

"rmax304823","30 April 2008","Film makers have to step carefully when dealing with issues like the Nazi extermination program. There have been equally brutal programs of ethnic cleansing in places like Southeast Asia and Rwanda, in which hundreds of millions died, but nothing like this in Europe since the Middle Ages. The victims here were not only Jews but Gypsies, the mentally ill, homosexuals, socialists, communists, and political undesirables. The Nazis eliminated not six million but some uncountable number between 12 and 15 million. An event like that can't be treated lightly and milked for easy tears, or the event itself is cheapened.Fortunately, the films that have explored the subject have been uniformly well done, as Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is well done. Polanski himself suffered in much the same way as the protagonist, Vlad Szpilman (Adrien Brody). Polanski has a habit of embellishing his tales but there's no question that in this instance he knows what he's talking about.Szpilman is a well-known young pianist on Warsaw radio but the German occupation puts the station out of business. He and his family are herded into the Warsaw ghetto where they are subject to constant abuse and occasional murder. Szpilman barely escapes being sent to Treblinka with the rest of his family. And for the last half of the film, with the help of some friends who endanger themselves by lending him aid, he scuttles rat-like from one hiding place to another, each more dismal and perilous than the last. He suffers jaundice, his hair and beard grow long, his clothes turn to tatters, his food disappears, he's half frozen, and he seems to shrink.He's reduced to living in the attic of a nearly demolished apartment building and is ecstatic to discover a gallon can of pickles overlooked on the top shelf of a kitchen cabinet. The can falls out of his hands while he tries to open it and rolls across the floor to come to rest at the boots of a German officer, Captain Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann). The only Germans we've seen so far have been brutes -- ridiculing the insane, executing Jews who ask simple questions, or simply shooting people chosen at random.We expect nothing from Hosenfeld except a quick shooting. But Hosenfeld is a human being and, having discovered that Szpilman ""is"" -- or rather ""was"" -- a pianist, he asks him to play a piano left in one of the flats. Szpliman has been unable to play for years and when he seats himself we worry that he might not bring it off and, indeed, his first chords are tentative, uncertain. Then his playing becomes automated, the old habits return, and he dashes off a dramatic and exquisitely executed piece of Chopin. Hosenfeld has been leaning back, enjoying the music, then leaves Szpilman quietly to his attic. He returns a few times later, before the Germans withdraw before the Russians, and unceremoniously hands him a few packages of food and, finally, his overcoat. The matter-of-fact compassion shown by Hosenfeld, and Szpilman's desperate need for contact with another human, are very moving.When the Russian troops finally arrive, Szpilman stumbles out of his hovel to greet them, but seeing his overcoat the Russians open fire on him. Szpilman finally convinces them that he is a Pole, not a German, and one of the befuddled soldiers asks, ""Then why the ****ing coat?"" Szpilman is trembling with fear but manages to gulp, ""I was cold."" An epilogue tells us that Szpilman went on with his career and Hosenfeld wound up in a Soviet prison camp where he died in 1952, despite Szpilman's attempt to find him. Under the end credits, a smiling Szpilman plays a lively, sparkling composition by Chopin.It's a remarkable film. Polanski is no longer the Wunderkind but a mature film maker. Nothing is excessive. We need only as much as we need to know to understand Szpilman's travails -- one tragedy following another. There are no sentimental speeches at the final parting of Szpilman and his family. Szpilman himself never breaks down. He simply does what needs to be done to survive. And Adrien Brody captures what Szpilman must have been like. (From some angles he resembles the young Arthur Rubenstein.) Kretschmann gets Hosenfeld down pat as well. In their scenes together we sense their respective positions -- one man with nothing left to lose, the other with nothing left to gain. The story, and the historical facts it's based on, raise many questions about human nature, of course. I'm not at all sure that if we could find the answers to those questions we would like what we found.One of the better films of the year.","

"KineticSeoul","16 February 2011","This is a well crafted movie that deserves some praise, but I still felt the film is a bit overrated. I guess it's cause I was expecting a phenomenal and amazing movie, but what I got was a pretty good movie. It just wasn't as powerful or compelling as I thought it would be. Adrien Brody was almost perfect for this role, his transition from being a prideful musician to a broken down man was done really well. This film just wasn't all that challenging, the plot is basically based on a true story of Władysław Szpilman(Adrien Brody). And his struggle to survive during the Holocaust. The thing is the whole thing seems a bit conventional a lot of aspect of this movie just seemed to narrow at times and straightforward which isn't necessarily a good thing and lack depth. The film also seemed to drag a bit because of the direction it kept going, it's a good movie and I agree with some of the positive feedback this film has been getting. It just isn't a powerful or amazing film I was looking forward to seeing, not one of those movies I feel I need to see again someday after it's finished. It really isn't a masterpiece like come critics claim it to be.7.8/10","

"Xstal","28 October 2020","Around 30% of Warsaw's population was Jewish in 1939, about 375,000 people; with refugees, the population of the ghetto rose to 450,000 - over 80,000 perished in it; deportations to Treblinka began in July 1942 (Yad Vashem).I would rather have seen this film in the languages of those it portrays using actors from the countries and regions where these despicable, heinous and unforgivable events took place. It would have made an already immensely powerful reflection even more so.","

"orangeisthenewawesome","21 February 2011","My husband and I decided to watch this on netflix one night as we had heard it was good. Neither of us had any expectations and figured if it won a couple of Oscars it must be decent. I had no idea it was an absolute masterpiece. This may be one of the best movies I have seen to date. Days after I saw this movie I cannot stop visualizing the images and feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. The cinematography is breathtaking. The beauty of pre-devastation Warsaw is sharply contrasted with the bleakness of the ghetto, and it would be understatement to say how haunting the visuals of Warsaw after the bombings were. The acting here is tremendous. Brody (who I had really not seen in anything else significant prior to this) carries the entire movie on his wan shoulders. He conveys so much with pain, anguish, hope, and loss with just his eyes. It is quite the actor who causes the viewer to feel the pain he is experiencing as a character. This was an extremely well deserved acting Oscar.This movie is extremely depressing considering the subject matter but it is told and portrayed with grace and power by Polanski. So many scenes are powerful and haunting. To me, in many ways this is a perfect movie. Yes, I know this review is filled with hyperbole, but I simply cannot remember the last time I was so moved and impressed by a film as I was with the Pianist. See it at least once.","

You see the violence ramp up as the film progresses.It's an incredibly well made film, it looks terrific, people look very much of that time, surely a consideration the casting director used.Several things that always stayed with me, someone begging with a corpse laying on the ground that was one moment, another being the elderly man in the wheelchair, harrowing sequences.I thought Adrien Brody was excellent as Szpillman, a very understated performance, totally sincere, incredibly believable. Ed Stoppard, Frank Findlay, Maureen Lipman and others all so good.It's a long film, but incredibly rewarding.10/10.","

"zetes","6 July 2003","The Pianist is far from Roman Polanski's best film or his `most personal work,' as the back of the DVD case says. In fact, it's easily the least personal film I've seen from him; any director who has enough clout to secure the funding for the production could have made this film and had it turn out just as well. As a director, it is a small achievement. Likewise, the screenplay writes itself; in fact, it did write itself, as it's based on a true story. I must admit I have a bias against films dealing with WWII and especially the Jewish experience in Europe. Affecting the audience is as simple as snapping one's fingers. Or, more specifically, executing a Jew. Whenever the audience starts to get a little comfortable, all the filmmaker has to do is have a Nazi shoot a Jew in the head. It's all too easy. Any film with that subject matter is automatically deemed important in the minds of critics and audiences, which makes it difficult for anyone to propose any criticism against it. Truth be told, The Pianist is a very good film. It's well done, and, while I don't think it's Polanski's best work, he does a good job. But it's too easy, I think, to overpraise something like this. It was very entertaining that this movie caused so many upsets at the Oscars, but, after seeing the film, it doesn't surprise me. This is the kind of movie that impresses the Academy most, because it's easy. The three awards it won were not deserved, at least in my opinion. If I weren't so familiar with the Academy and their thought processes, it would really shock me that Polanski beat Scorsese, who made an original picture with verve and passion, and that Brody (I haven't mentioned him, and he is good) beat Daniel Day-Lewis, who, as I've just said above, creates a character that will live forever. As for the screenplay, Ronald Harwood (and/or Polanski) could have made the film much more than just one of ten thousand tales of survival. There are a lot of moments when more substance could have been found. I like how Szpilman has to constantly watch the action while locked up in a room, yearning to be able to do something about it, but always relegated to the spectator's role. They do do well when they introduce the character of the Nazi soldier trying to make good by helping Szpilman, but they don't do very much. Of course, I think part of the point is that this man appeared and disappeared without much pomp or circumstance. In fact, it would have been more powerful if they had never revealed that Szpilman discovered who this man was. Of course, that might have been disrespectful.I have now seen all five Best Picture nominees from last year, and I would rank them as follows: 1) The Hours; 2) Gangs of New York; 3) The Pianist; 4) Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers; 5) Chicago. That I rank the actual winner last shouldn't raise eyebrows, because, to tell you the truth, I don't rank The Pianist and The Two Towers that much higher. The first two were original, intelligent, and challenging. The last three were much simpler, and it's no big surprise that they are more beloved. 8/10.","

"dbdumonteil","29 December 2005","In March 2003, Roman Polanski's ""the Pianist"" (2002) pocketed three Oscars including best actor (Adrien Brody) and best director (Roman Polanski). One month earlier, the ceremony of the French Oscars showered the movie with praise by attributing to it and his author similar prizes. Earlier in May 2002, the festival of Cannes crowned it of the most prestigious prize: the deservedly Golden Palm. Already in 2002 and chiefly throughout 2003, awards rained on Polanski's deeply moving piece of work and rightly so. It is a true return to form for him after an uneven career which started after the spooky ""the Tenant"" (1976) and wildly oscillated between duds (Pirates, 1986, Frantic, 1988) and palatable but not peerless works (Death and the Maiden, 1994, the Ninth Gate, 1999). ""The Pianist"" helped to rekindle the flame that made such treasures, hallmarks in their own domains (the wonderful ""Rosemary's Baby"", 1968 in the fantastic or the fabulous ""Chinatown"", 1974 in the film noir) and could be a stalwart success in the movie with the Second World War as the backdrop. It is perhaps Polanski's most personal film to date and the one he has always wanted to shot, surely to exorcise traumatic memories haunting him since his childhood. Like his main protagonist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, he experienced the horror of the ghetto of Warsaw.To get his demons out of his head, he preferred to adapt for the screen Spilzman's memories, a genius pianist and a man who bit by bit lost his family and friends on whom he could rely, a man who was deprived of his piano and thus of his ""raison d'être"". As Stefan Zweig says: ""to read is to live"", well for him ""to play is to live"". Even when he has the opportunity to play, he has to refrain himself. See the scene in which he has settled down to his flat. Before leaving him, the owner says to him: ""please, don't make noise"". Polanski makes us share his craving for playing by putting his main protagonist in front of the sacred instrument ans plays us the music in Spilzman's head without the latter touches the keys. He was also a man who saw sorrow, pain and the unthinkable (the sequences in which German officers and soldiers kill Jewish people give goose pimples because they're precisely unthinkable). Throughout his sufferings, chance didn't totally relinquish him: he was rescued at the last minute by a Polish policeman (and a fellow of his brother) who stopped him from going up in the train of death to Auschwitz. At this moment, he was saved from death but he lost his family. Then, he had to rely on his courage to survive and enjoyed the help of some fellows even if they absconded (the woman Spilzman made the acquaintance at the beginning of the film and her husband who found him a flat). At last, the German officer at the end of the film, was his ultimate glimmer of hope.Roman Polanski shot his film with a classic but startling directing for the sake of detail and realism. It has a linear but inevitable progression which has the look of a downward spiral: the tightening of the restrictions on Jewish people which become increasingly harsher (the armband to distinguish the Jewish from other peoples, then the delimitation and the encircling of the ghetto, the Jews chased away from their neighborhood and deported to the extermination camps) and the least sign of certainty is nearly automatically blighted: ""we have work certificates at last"" sighs Spilzman's father. Alas! Hopes blighted since just as he pronounces these words, a German officer asks them with other people to go outside. Some of them are killed while the others (including Spilzman's family) have to wait on a large square with thousands of others. Polanski also relates notable events with a minimum of means (the fight and shooting sequences are often perceived from a balcony or a window).The second part of the film strongly recalls Polanski's murkiest hours extracted from his masterworks. For example, in his flat, Spilzman tries to be as quiet as possible and while searching for food in his kitchen and drops crockery. The noise makes his neighbor intervene and by giving the alarm in the building obliges him to flee once again. At this moment, we find one of Polanski's trademarks: the eerie neighbor who has a harmful influence on the hero and contributes to his or her fall (the Castevet in ""Rosemary's Baby"", the offbeat inhabitants of the building in ""the Tenant"". In another extent, when Spilzman has to lurk in the destroyed ghetto (the distant shot where we can see him trudging in the ruins of this apocalyptic landscape deserves to rank among Polanski's most notable shots in all his filmography), Polanski really places us amid a ""in camera"" in spite of the sprawling scenery.The filmmaker should also be thanked for having chosen Adrien Brody in the main role. He works wonders in a part which seemed to be tailor-made for him, a far cry from his cardboard character in M Night Shyamalan's ""the Village"" (2004). He can act several persona in himself: a smart young man as well as a dirty and bearded tramp. His angular face, his acute and melancholic countenance stay with us for a long time. As for the German officers, they are often caricatured but ultimately Polanski eschews the trap of Manicheism which seemed to pervade the whole film thanks to the last sequences with the sympathetic German officer. Not all Nazis were beasts...Interspersed with either unbearable, either excruciating or either moving sequences and with striking shots, ""the Pianist"" has its place on the podium of Polanski's towering achievements. See it any costs! Unfortunately it would seem that the flame began to flicker again given the lukewarm critics ""Oliver Twist"" met this year. The slump again? Only time will tell...","

"Shilo_R_A","18 March 2023","The Pianist must be one of the most acclaimed and well-known depictions of the Holocaust in cinema, ever. Directed by Roman Polanski, it follows the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman - a Jewish pianist in Warsaw, Poland, just as the Nazi occupation begins there. It depicts the worsening state of him and his family through the Holocaust, and his struggle to survive throughout it.I can appreciate the sentiment of the film, showing how even well-known artists and people with status were stripped by the Nazi regime of their human rights, how things slowly escalated until even the artists couldn't think of art outside of dreams, maybe. How it all came down to surviving, and even the luckiest people that somehow managed to survived were deeply scarred by the horrible things they've seen. I'd say that Brody gives a very solid performance, and the film does manage to accomplish what it tries to do, in a way. The problem is, well, that it doesn't do much beyond that.There were scenes with shock value, sure, and thinking that everything we saw in the film is pretty close to how things went down can make one shiver all right. But the plot, especially in the second half of the film, didn't have much meat at all. The film crawled its way forward, the saturation goes down with each scene, but never did anything special to compensate for the slow, slow pacing and lack of interest I had in the main plot. The cinematography is okay, the dialogue is okay, the performances are okay. The moments that moved me were mostly that - moments - and mostly on the first half of the film. For a 2.5-hour film, it could've done more. Especially considering how widely acclaimed it is.So, if I had to sum it up, I'd say that I do appreciate certain things in the movie - the way it depicts the fall, the terror and the utter shock that Jewish artists have felt as they were torn apart from their seemingly-safe world, for instance. The shock value is definitely there in certain scenes, but the overall experience was pretty slow and lacking. I wasn't immersed, and I think that the film ends up feeling just...well, not bad, but not really good either. The first half is pretty good; the second half is mostly meh. I'm feeling something like a 6.3/10. Really wanted to like this more, but I guess it wasn't meant to be.","

"ma-cortes","18 November 2008","This is an emotionally tale and very decent drama about a pianist named Szpilman from luxurious life until terrible ending in the Warsaw ghetto. Polanski correctly directs a spellbinding portrait about the holocaust with his personal knowledge and proper experience on his childhood . Adrien Brody is excellent in a complicate and suffering role. Besides splendid actors, Frank Finlay,Jessica Meyer, Emilia Fox and Thomas Kretschman as a good Nazi officer who helps him. Evocative cinematography by cameraman Pawel Edlman, Polanski's usual. Musical score by Wojciech Kilar with brilliant piano sounds. Academy Award for best director Roman Polanski, Actor, Adrien Brody and adapted script by Ronald Harwood based on Wladyslaw Szpilman memories.Adding more details over largely described on the movie referred 'the Warsaw ghetto uprising', the events happened on the following manner : In 1939, after the invasion of Poland, Reinhard Heydrich chief of Gestapo began to place all Polish Jews in ghettos, where they could slowly die of hunger and disease. The campaign was to be administered by the Waffen-SS the party's military formations that fought as integral units in the armed forces. The Warsaw ghetto was the largest of these segregated areas established by the Nazis in Poland. In 1940 Heydrich, using the excuse that the spread of typhus had to be contained, set up a special section 11 miles in circumference enclosed by a brick wall 10 feet high. The cost was paid by the Judenrat, the Jewish Council of twenty-four-members, which was in charge of Jewish affairs inside the ghetto. In 1940 more than 80.000 gentile Poles living in the infected area were ordered to leave, and the next month about 140,000 living elsewhere in the city were moved in which the 240,000 still live in the ghetto. Some 360.000 Jews, a third of Warsaw's population, were herded into a 3,5-square-mile area. Meanwhile, Gestapo agents removed all Jews from the economic and cultural life of the city, from factories,shops, theaters, and libraries. On November 15,1940, the ghetto was sealed and its twenty-two entrances closed. No one was allowed to leave or enter, there was to be contact with the outside world.The situation soon became critical,Jews fought for jobs in the ghetto, including work with the labor battalions organized by the Nazis. Those unable to find work tried to exist by selling jewels,clothing, or anything else to obtain food. From 300 to 400 died daily in the Warsaw trap. More than 43.000 starved to death during the first year. Children crazed by hunger crawled through the sewers to the non-Jewish sectors of the city to smuggle in a bit of food. People were no longer moved by the sight of men and women falling dead on the streets. The Nazi authorities began intensified measure on July 22, 1942. As a memorial to Heydrich, Heirich Himmler ordered all Jews except those already in concentration camps to be deported .The ghetto and all labor camps would then be destroyed. Mass deportations to the gas chambers of Treblinka began. In two months 300.000 Jews were eliminated. The Judenrat was ordered to deliver 6.000 Jews daily for deportation. Each day thousands were driven by guards through the gates.Young Zionists, pioneers training to go to Palestine, mobilized first to be followed by members of the Polish workers party . On July 28, 1942, the Jewish Combat organization consisting about 1.000 men and boys was formed. All resolved to kill as many of their tormentors as they could before they died.The Jews fighting from rooftops, cellars, and attics,Poles outside the ghetto now began to send in more revolvers, grenades, and dynamite. In 1943 the guerrillas divided into twenty-two groups built an intricate network underground cellars and tunnels ,linked with command posts . In April 19,1943 German troops moved in on the ghetto to send all who were left to Treblinka in a final action. First came the armed trucks, tanks, and armored cars. The ghetto fighters poured a hail of bullets, grenades and bombs, the fighting went on for twenty-eight days. The guerrillas fought to the last. Many committed suicide at the moment before capture. The Germans dragged survivors from the cellars and rubble. Fewer than 100 escaped, the last 60000 Jews had been exterminated or killed in the explosions and fires.Polish sources reported that the fighters had killed 300 Germans and wounded 1000. From Warsaw Jewish resistance moved to swamps and forests.","

"Buddy-51","14 June 2003","`The Pianist' is a bit like `Schindler's List' as seen from the inside out.  The one flaw in that earlier film always seemed to be that, by choosing to make a Gentile  Oskar Schindler - the protagonist in his film, Spielberg turned the Jews themselves almost into background players in their own story.  That doesn't happen with `The Pianist' since the hero in this case happens to be himself a Jew  the real life Polish pianist and composer Wladyslaw Szpilman - who managed, through strength, determination and the assistance of a number of brave and caring individuals, to survive the horrors of that darkest and most inexplicable chapter in 20th Century history.This is not to say that `The Pianist' is a better film than `Schindler's List'  far from it.  For while this latest work from Roman Polanski is a fascinating tale of survival in its own right, the film lacks the moral and psychological resonance that made Spielberg's work such a universally acclaimed masterpiece.  Because Schindler was an outsider looking in, he was forced to make the kind of moral choices that Szpilman never really faces in the situations in which he finds himself.  In fact, the one time that the protagonist is confronted with such an option  having to decide whether or not to betray his people by joining the Jewish police whose job it is maintain order in the Warsaw ghetto  Szpilman flat out declines the offer. This may, indeed, be the way circumstances played themselves out in real life, but this elimination of any kind of psychological depth makes `The Pianist' seem frustratingly superficial at times.Although the film isn't as rich and powerful as it might have been, `The Pianist' is still exceptional on a lot of different levels.  First of all, Polanski and his screenwriter, Ronald Hardwood, both of whom won Oscars for their work here, capture the brutality and sadism of the Nazi regime with frightening candor and almost `reportorial' objectivity.  As in `Schindler's List,' people in this film die in very believable, very graphic ways. Particularly interesting are the early sections of the film in which we witness the gradual steps leading up to the eventual deportation and extermination of the Warsaw Jews, beginning with the curtailment of Jewish civil rights, then to the branding of them with stars of David on their clothing, then to their imprisonment in the Warsaw ghetto, and, finally, to the inexorable walk to the gas chamber.  `The Pianist' doesn't take us that far on screen, but we sure sense the presence of those death camps in the loss of Szpilman's entire family.  `The Pianist' brilliantly recreates this shameful era in recent human history and does so without becoming sentimental and pretentious in the process.  Adrian Brody won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance here, and he is very good indeed, especially given the fact that the role calls for him to be more of a reactor to the events around him than a catalyst.  Polanski and Hardwood have provided this fine young actor with a veritable tour de force assignment that he executes with a great deal of skill and aplomb. Unfortunately, a number of the other characters - particularly those who go out of their way to help him - remain stubbornly enigmatic throughout.`The Pianist' is an honorable addition to the list of fine films that have attempted to come to grips with the subject of the holocaust.  But, for my money, the best still remains `The Shop on Main Street,' the Oscar-winning Best Foreign Language film of 1965.  This superb Czech film does what `The Pianist' is never quite able to do, which is to find a way to involve us in the momentous moral dilemmas that undoubtedly faced many of the people involved in this life-and-death event.  `The Pianist,' by making its tale strictly a story of survival and not a study of human psychology, fails to illuminate much of what we really need to know about that time. And about ourselves.","

"sddavis63","4 November 2009","The first thing that should be said is that this is most definitely more than a Holocaust movie. Although that dreadful event stands firmly in the background, this movie is really about one man's struggle for survival. The one man is Polish Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Adrien Brody played that lead role, and he played it well. Szpilman comes across as both pitiful in his desperation to survive but at the same time as noble in his desperation to survive. Brody portrays him as a man with great dignity. It was a challenging role, because as the movie progresses, there's less and less dialogue for the simple reason that almost everyone except Szpilman has been taken by the Nazis. Brody ends up playing long stretches without voice, but it doesn't stop him from rendering a brilliant portrait of the man, whose friends and family are gone and who simply tries to live day by day hoping for a way out of this madness. Just as haunting are extended scenes in which director Roman Polanski simply shows us a devastated Warsaw - not just the Jewish ghetto, but other parts of the city as well. The scenes of rubble, the scenes of innocent people being gunned down in the street by German soldiers - sometimes just for sport, without any other obvious reason, the scenes of burned out buildings. It's all haunting.For all that - and all that was very good - there was something about the story that didn't really click with me. For some strange reason I found it difficult to follow and I did think that at almost two and a half hours it was a little bit too long. As much as was accomplished in that running time could have been accomplished in two hours flat. It's a good movie, but just failed to reach the level of greatness that some have assigned to it. 6/10","

"johnharapa","23 October 2021","Some reviews I've read here, have found this movie too detached, lacking urgency. I believe, that impassive quality reflects exactly what Polanski wants to say this extraordinary jewel.By showing Wladyslaw Szpilman as a survivor but not a fighter or a hero--as a man who does all he can to save himself, but would have died without enormous good luck and some kindness from a few non-Jews--Polanski is reflecting, I believe, his own deepest feelings: that he survived, but need not have, and that his mother died and left a wound that had never properly healed.Adrian Brody's performance was utterly mesmerising. I doubt that we'll see him act like that - EVER.Little wonder he was awarded Best Male Actor at the Oscars.Polanski too was awarded Best Director - ironic Brody was the youngest recipient of an Oscar and Polanski was the oldest until Clint Eastwood won it several years later.","

"ACollegeStudent","17 May 2023","Rating: 7.0The movie was ok, it put you in the shoes of a Jewish pianist surviving the German occupation. Honestly, it's boring in stretches since we already know the pianist survives therefore it has no stakes. Due to this and a subject matter has been done to death it personally didn't move me. The side characters weren't compelling or interesting, and the pianist himself is just a guy on the run who can play the piano, no other notable traits besides that. Because the subject matter is overdone and we already know how it ends it needs a lot more to keep it engaging which this doesn't have. Granted this is a biography so can't deviate too much or else it loses accuracy.","

"Derek237","30 March 2003","The Pianist is not a movie made for entertainment. It's either more or less than that and only the viewer can decide. You have to ask yourself sometimes if the main reason films about the holocaust are so popular is because of shock appeal. If a movie depicts these terrifying events well, does that make it a good movie? The Pianist has many scenes showing the Nazi's brutality that feel almost voyeuristic. Some scenes show Adrien Brody's character looking out the window at these terrible things and you feel as if you're looking out a window, too.I hope shock appeal isn't the reason this film is liked so much, though. Because this is an amazing story about the will to survive. Music is the character's passion,and throughout his struggles he can only fantasize about playing piano. There is one scene near the end in which he finally gets the opportunity. What follows is a touching moment that transitions from rusty skills warming up to an intense and passionate display of artistic talent. In this moment there is no longer a war going on, no longer the agony of hunger or memories of lost loved ones, just beautiful music. His reputation as a musician and his desire to go on to play again is essentially what keeps him alive. And who says art isn't important?Adrien Brody is very good in this. Well obviously he is, he just won the Best Actor Oscar. I think he can be compared to Tom Hanks in Cast Away- even in scenes of silence there's just something about the actor's movements and expressions that keeps you engaged.There's another scene near the end that defines the entire performance, the entire movie for me: After all the trouble Brody went through trying to survive, he is almost killed by the people who would save him. He is wearing a coat that a German officer had given him earlier, and when Russian troops spotted Brody they thought he was German. They shot at him and almost killed him, but they finally found out he was Polish. An officer asks him, ""Why the f-cking coat?"" Brody, with his hands still in the air, a terrified look on his face, almost crying, replies: ""I'm cold."" That did it for me.The Pianist is certainly a shocking and even depressing film, but like most movies that aspire to provoke thoughts and emotions, the audience takes out of it what they bring in to it. Surely Szpiellman wasn't just a lucky bastard who survived in times of inhumane brutality. It was through the kindness and compassion of others who helped him, if only because they found themselves inexplicably moved by his music.My rating: 10/10","

"evanston_dad","4 August 2010","Before seeing ""The Pianist,"" I thought there couldn't possibly be a movie about the Holocaust that could tell me something I didn't already know, or make me feel an emotion I haven't already felt a hundred times before about the topic. But director Roman Polanski proved me wrong.There's a scene in ""The Pianist"" in which Nazis invade a Jewish apartment building and ""clean out"" its tenants. They pick up an elderly man confined to a wheelchair, carry the chair to the edge of the balcony, and casually tip him over the edge to fall to his death on the pavement below. The moment shocked me in a way that nothing in Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" did, I think precisely because, unlike Spielberg, Polanski isn't interested in manipulating his audience into feeling something. The strength of his movies has always been that they unfold with a detached, objective point of view and let audiences draw their own conclusions. The scene described above is so shocking because Polanski does nothing to embellish it and therefore never draws attention to the fact that you're watching a movie.The rest of the film is like that -- it's harrowing and unpleasant at times, but it also rewards the viewer by saying something about a historical event when I didn't think there was anything left to say.Grade: A","

"tedg","21 April 2003","Spoilers herein.Nearly any film is for me a double experience: the watching and the post-coital rumination. That second phase can make the experience worthwhile even when the film itself is ordinary or poorly done.But it works the other way as well, especially when a film is designed for discussion: the film delivered with so many opinions that themselves are ordinary or poorly done. This film comes so charged. Szpilman wasn't `Jewish enough' to be the center of an important holocaust film, goes the most ordinary and loudest of them. I suppose there are some things about the commingling of descriptive art and definitive life to be said there. But one likes to have more freedom in post-film thoughts and that whole topic is dominated by the sorts of reflexive responses manipulated by film.There's a second prepackaged topic concerning whether `Schindler' was better or `worse.' I don't consider Spielberg's film a holocaust film at all: he lives in a happy world, where justice and right (and lots of other happy values) always triumph. His observations are always external. His goal is always to tell a story, a stance that furthers the distance between his films and reality. Polanski's project has no story at all, merely a life of accidents. His camera is within the artist's personal space. His own mannerisms are Eastern European and depressed, congruent with what he shows. (Speilberg's Schindler really did have the silk unctuousness of the East, but as observed from California.) So I credit Polanski's vision as having more historical credibility than Speilberg's, knowing that despite the best efforts of us all to avoid having practical history made by the movie marketplace.(One exception, where Polanksi is offensively theatrical: when Szpliman runs from the destroyed hospital, he faces a street of desolation as far as one can see, `High Noon'-wise.)Much more interesting to my mind is the portrayal of an artist. Polanski has always been deeply self-referential in his work: always there is an examination of the artist within the art. And I make a minor hobby out of collecting film experiences that do this with music and mathematics because I have some personal experience to work with. For those who don't know: Polands pride is Chopin, who invented a relationship to the piano that not only defined modernity but reinvented everything about musical performance. (Film would follow this lead in 1941.) Chopin built pieces designed to be bent in performance, designed with empty rooms that a pianist could explore. Unlike, Bach for instance, where the magic of the performance was in attuning to Bach and his intent, the performer of Chopin really could bring his own soul to parity with God. Szpliman was a strong pianist, and therefore more than a national character, instead a reflection of the Polish heart.Here, we  watch this man compromise his own pride, eschew his religion, run away from every opportunity for dignity in order to keep his hands warm to play another day; and not just play, but play on the radio for Poles. So during this painful journey, we assume what we are meant to in films about tortured artists: that the pain we are watching will be transmuted by this man into great art that will lift us all. His own personal denigration - what is done to him and the denigrating choices he makes - are worth it overall.This is where the fatal pessimism of Polanski stops, because he doesn't let us know the musical truth. This is not Szpilmans playing of course, but not much unlike him. Szpilman was a `safe' player, one who never had the strength or desire to add much to Chopin. That's why he was on the radio: his `interpretations' were unchallenging and palatable. But he would never have been considered an artist of note at all if he had not survived the perfect brutality of the Germans, whose own music, though sentimental was constrained in ways that Chopin's never was. The payoff is supposed to be that after his trials, the artist is now - theoretically - capable of expressing the pain and yearning of the world. That we are meant to so think is clear from the end, where he plays with the glow of Dreyfuss from `Music of the Heart.'Ah, but not so. The sound we actually hear throughout is by Olejniczak, a similarly ordinary man. Szpilman did not in fact come through a better artist, but much worse: a meek pianist. `Shellshocked,' postwar contemporaries would say. Contrast this with Artur Rubinstein. Jewish Pole of the previous generation, and the first giant to explore Chopin's rubato. He had his own dark nights, but not because the world was inhospitable. Listen to his recordings (freely available) compared to Szpilmans (hard to get) or even Olejniczaks on the soundtrack. These are two different universes. One is merely pleasant, the other life-altering.Polanski has made some great films (including the under-appreciated `Ninth Gate'), and his thinking through of the intellectual reach of a project is extensive but he has ultimately let us down here. Implicit in much of modern Jewishness is the triumph of enrichment of the people through their tribulation. Perhaps that is true, but this film undermines the idea when selecting Szpilman as metaphor.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.","

"gavin6942","19 May 2010","I don't have much to say on this movie, other than that it was very good. Adrien Brody is a fine actor and this is probably his finest role (though I'm partial to ""The Jacket"").My only real concern with this film ,and it shouldn't be seen as a slight against it, is that it seems that making a film about the Holocaust makes a film automatically better. I'm not sure if it's because it evokes emotions or what, but this film, ""Schindler's List"" and others quickly rise to the top of the list of good films... World War II in general seems to do this, but the Holocaust even more so. It's an odd phenomenon.","

"9902439Claessens","1 October 2002","last weekend, I saw Roman Polanski's The Pianist and what a movie. The grizzly reality feeling of the movie shell-shocked me in the first place but later on I recognized the pure feeling of the film: The horror what war does with innocent people truly is. the main story isn't about a war hero, but about people who don't want to die in this madness. Every aspect of the film is really done for an reason and in his place and you don't feel this as entertainment.the music is what hit me the most. the classical tunes had such an enormous impact on me and portrayed the feelings of the main role of the pianist. The fact that there are no hero's in a war movie is for me more than a welcome benefit. No war in the world should have hero's who can't die. Everybody in this movie can die, every second of it. The scary moments are real scary.
bottom line: ten times as realistic as the also brilliant Schindler's list. and twenty times better than Saving private Ryan for the lack of hero's and there is no patriotism at all.ten out of ten, best movie of 2002","

"Poseidon-3","19 January 2004","Far from the first motion picture to deal with the Holocaust and unlikely to be the last, this is nevertheless a stunning piece of film.  Brody portrays the title character (based on an actual person) who plays piano on Polish radio until the Nazi invasion of his country makes it impossible to continue.  Through his eyes, the audience witnesses the continual, seemingly-unstoppable dehumanization of Brody and his family and the virtual destruction of Poland.  The journey that this character takes, undoubtedly enhanced by director Polanski's own recollection of his early life, is almost incomprehensible.  Since so many films have been released on this subject, one can't help noticing the similarity to other movies and the familiarity of the situations depicted in the opening scenes.  However, the utter craftsmanship of this film and the casting (nothing short of perfection down the very last role) set this apart until the story's uniqueness kicks in.  Brody is nothing short of magnificent.  His face reflects (naturally and without mugging) the soulfulness, humiliation and deprivation of his character.  Polanski does a superb job of recreating the world of WWII Poland.  Every detail of the film is exact and mesmerizing (helped greatly by casting non-name actors who inhabit their roles with great feeling and authenticity.  There is no opportunity to play ""spot the star"" except for the most seasoned filmgoer.)  What happens to Brody is so startlingly, stunningly jaw-dropping it seems surreal at times.  Amazingly, Polanski is able to occasionally inject the faintest touches of black humor and irony to this, which makes for some very intriguing viewing.  That is not to say that the film is easy to watch.  Already a master (for decades) of creating feelings of unease, paranoia and fear in the viewer, Polanski sets into motion a film in which the audience can hardly breathe for fear that their own noise will result in the discovery of the frequently hidden Brody.  The film is notable for making sounds such as marching boots, idling cars and faraway voices seem more terrifying than anything Hollywood has ever had to offer in all of its multitudinous thrillers and horror films. If there are any faults in the film, they are few.  Perhaps some of Brody's experiences seem repetitive at times and the depiction of Germans sometimes approaches caricature.  However, all is forgiven as the story reaches its heart-stopping moment when Brody is attempting to open an all-important can of food.  Here the film reaches brilliance.  Clearly, the film is not going to appeal to the shallow or the disinterested, but to those who have a fondness for striking, deeply-felt and lovingly-told stories, this one is hard to top.","

"Close_The_Door","25 January 2006","I knew Roman Polanski's talent but was not prepared to this descent to Hell, described in painstaking detail. I'm physically upset after watching this film. The sense of disgust is real. How awful. How awful.I could not help identifying myself with the Jewish Poles in Varsovia. I couldn't help thinking that the paralytic old man thrown down the window could be my grandfather. Couldn't help thinking that the kid savagely pulled through the wall could be my brother. Couldn't help thinking that the girl asking the SS-guard the wrong question and being killed just for that, could be myself.The film describes beastly destruction of any dignity, and yet the struggle for surviving despite everything, even if rationally you realise that, perhaps, it would be even better to end it all at once. It describes the dishonesty of people profiting of this situation to make business out of your misery. It describes your need of believing the words of men NOT of their word, if they promise you life. And affection and courage surviving despite all this.This film could make a good pair with ""der Untergang"" with Bruno Ganz, which is also such a masterpiece that you may risk feeling sympathetic with the Nazi. Have you had this temptation? Watch ""The Pianist"".","

"Theo Robertson","20 September 2009","The problem with making a holocaust film is that it's a subject that's been done before . Everyone from Steven Spielberg to ( Amazingly and somewhat hypocritically I say ) Vanessa Redgrave has made a film centering around the Nazi attempt to exterminate European Jewry . I have a problem with this because it denigrates history to an extent . If people have to make a film featuring man's inhumanity to man as a reminder what does this say for the rest of humanity ? Can't the rest of humanity watch a documentary like SHOA or the Genocide episode of THE WORLD AT WAR ( My first introduction to The Holocaust ) or read a book of the accounts of Nazi mass murder ? Would it be too cynical to point out how well rewarded Holocaust movies are ? It's also noticeable how formulaic these type of movies are . We start at the beginning of the war and follow the protagonist's survival until they're liberated by the allies in 1945 That said THE PIANIST does have merits of its own even though it doesn't really bring much to the table originality wise . Actually the food allegory is appropriate though slightly confusing . Early in the film we see the terrible conditions in the Warsaw ghetto as its Jewish population are effectively walled up from the rest of the city and left to die . Cut to a restaurant interior as Wladyslaw Szpilman entertains the guests by playing the piano as the patrons grow fat by gorging themselves on food , fine wine and cigarettes as their fellow Jews fall dead in the streets . With a little editing you might find yourself thinking this part was directed by David Irving instead of Roman Polanski ! One thing THE PIANIST does do well is include the apocryphal tale of the Jews discussing their fate at the hands of the Nazis with no one wanting to believe for a second that the lone voice stating the Nazis are deporting them to be murdered may in fact be talking the truth no matter how unbelievable and horrific the truth may be Like I AM LEGEND the story suffers from the fact that the protagonist has no one to speak to for large portions of the narrative but there's so much incident on screen such as the Warsaw uprising it's not a major problem . You could make the point that Szpliman then becomes a spectator to Polish history rather than a character in his own right and you'd possibly be correct but these scenes are very well choreographed and filmed that it shouldn't be made as a criticism . There's also the introduction of "" A good German "" that we've seen before in films such as MUTTER'S COURAGE but Hosenfeld is so well drawn and acted by Thomas Kretschmann it's very difficult not to feel sorry for his fate In truth THE PIANIST follows the usual structure of holocaust movies but unlike some movies of this particular genre certainly deserved much of the critical acclaim hoisted upon it . As can be expected it's not a feel good movie but is definitely a well made and acted story of human suffering and endurance","

"Doylenf","11 June 2003","Words are inadequate to describe the flawless flow of events in this absorbing account of Polish Jews facing extinction in the Warsaw Ghetto of the '40s during the Nazi reign of terror.Surely the most deserving Oscar award in years was bestowed on Adrien Brody who captures his character completely and carries the film with his amazingly real performance. He is at the center of vision throughout most of the action--so perfect in his role that he makes the story an unforgettable experience. His confrontation with a Nazi officer who discovers his hiding place and then asks him to prove that he is a pianist by playing the piano, is just one of the memorable highlights. This scene alone was justification for Brody's Oscar.Roman Polanski's direction is masterful throughout, never allowing the story to bog down in sentimentality but keeping the focus on survival and some of the horrific things that happen along the way.An inspired piece of filmmaking that is stunning to watch because it is so real and moving. Not since SCHINDLER'S LIST has the brutality and epic sweep of World War II been captured so accurately.","

"ElMaruecan82","1 June 2012","To think that I avoided ""The Pianist"" for about 10 years because I expected a new ""Schindler's List""! And I don't even mean that negatively.I've watched Spielberg's film several times and know too well how painful Holocaust movies are, and while ""Life is Beautiful"" was a tragicomic fable and ""Sophie's Choice"" more of a character study relating a traumatic experience, I knew ""The Pianist"" would be on the same level of ambition and seriousness than Spielberg's film, if only because it was directed by Roman Polanski, a Holocaust survivor himself. I knew the movie would feature shocking arbitrary executions and poignant separations, so in a way, ""The Pianist"" was already having an impact on me without watching it. But this is not the only reason why I didn't feel the urge to watch it.Part of the blame is to be put on the film itself although it was inevitably going to be compared with its 'glorious' predecessor. Speaking of my own experience, I was mislead by ""The Pianist"" and the movie trailers. I thought it was the story of a man who played music for the Nazis and his survival, and therefore found in the present's horror and gloominess a heaven of escapism in the inner, universal and timeless beauty of music. Wladislaw would have the state of mind of one of Schindler's factory workers with music as the same weapon as Guido's humor and optimism in ""Life is Beautiful"". Of course, I realize now how my preconceived ideas totally underestimated Roman Polanski and I hope this review redeems my 10 years of abstinence.First, one must give to Spielberg what is Spielberg's and to Polanski what is Polanski's. ""Schindler's List"" is a better directed film but ""The Pianist"" is a better told story. And while the directing of Spielberg betrays sometimes the harshness of its subject by too much 'mise en scene', Polanski's ability to hook our hearts to the fate of Wladislaw Spillman, magnificently portrayed by Adrien Brody, and his family is beyond words. Indeed, we feel like part of this family. While the epic scope of ""Schindler's List"" provided a sort of moral aura to the victims, making the film a martyrdom's remembrance, ""The Pianist"" is simply the chronicles of a banal horror. And Polanski keeps an intimate, almost unnoticeable directing, to better convey the feeling that we're watching normal people whose lives are dramatically affected by an absurd War, and it's their very normality that emphasizes the cruelty of the Nazi treatment.The film opens in Warsaw in September 1939 so those with a minimum of historical knowledge understand the implication. Wladislaw is playing Chopin in a studio when the first German bombings are heard, his family wants to leave but later, they learn in the radio that France and Britain entered the War. Relieved, they celebrate the news with a toast, and the relatively cheerful ambiance contrasts with the usual demonstrations of grief and pain. Of course, we know the worst is to come, but Polanski takes his time to get us immersed in the war's ambiance and letting us observe the progressive decline of the Spillmans, directly mirroring the atmosphere that probably prevailed within all the Jewish families.Through the Spillman's perspectives, we get a more accurate idea of the nightmare endured by Polish Jews. When they're all parked in the Warsaw ghetto, before the inevitable evacuation, we witness gut-wrenching, intolerable, and acts of brutality, so unbelievably gratuitous and horrific, we never doubt that they're based on true stories, and that war, definitely, inspires the worst from humanity. In war, there's no room for dignity, for charity, for understanding, for God I would even say. As for violence, there is no scale, soldiers throwing off a balcony an old grandfather on a wheelchair because he couldn't stand is a horrifying sight, but maybe I expected these kind of moments so much that I was more shocked by the part where the soldiers made people dance together. Sometimes, humiliations are more impacting than random and arbitrary killings.And again, the talent of Polanski is precisely not to have overplayed on the directing department: no 'Black and White', no special effects, no 'little girl in Red', just basic colors, as to sustain the feeling of a present, more real then more horrific. ""Schindler's List"" might be a better film for some, but it's still a film, while ""The Pianist"" is a survival story, raw and real. Not a hero, not a victim either, the main protagonist will sometimes count on his courage, sometimes on his good luck, sometimes on the help of good-hearted and understanding people, from any sides. There is a light of hope in the film, through music, at a time where humanity reached its lowest point, music was here to remind people, to remind Nazis what a waste the War was, a feeling incarnated by Adrien Brody's sad-looking eyes.Again, don't expect a hero à la Oskar Schindler in Wladislaw, ""The Pianist"" shows the boldness of a period where cowardice was sometimes guided by survival instinct, where the desire to live could be more necessary than the desire to fight, because surviving left more voices to speak about the atrocities. ""The Pianist"" reveals those hidden subtleties that couldn't be truly expressed in epic movies. Some Jews didn't fight back precisely because the horrors of Auschwitz, Treblinka, Buchenwald had to be known, and ironically, this was one of the reasons that accelerated the exterminations' process. And some like Wladislaw had to hide not to make the sacrifices of the others unnecessary, those were tough times and no one is allowed to put a judgment... not us, anyway.And this is why ""The Pianist"" is more affecting than ""Schindler's List"", and if one has any doubt, let's not forget, that Spielberg was born in 1946 while Roman Polanski is still a war survivor who lost his mother in a Death Camp.","

"Steffi_P","5 April 2012","The Pianist is a movie that often gets bundled together with Schindler's List as being ""about"" the holocaust. But this is a misunderstanding, a simplification even, of this picture (and of Schindler's List). It relates to the holocaust, but it is not the story of the holocaust – it's the story of one man. Władisław Szpilman was an artist, with great talent in his hands and his mind, and in him is represented something very precious in humanity. He also appears, as many such people really are, someone to whom the music mattered far more than current affairs. As such, he provides a unusual view on atrocity, that of someone who, rather than actively fight against it, for the most part tried simply to exist in spite of it.This somewhat passive yet dignified stance is ably reflected in Roman Polanski's direction, which has always been characterised by an excruciating intimacy with his subjects and a certain detachment from the world in which they inhabit. Here we see Szpilman glimpsing the war through windows and doorways, yet often himself or his hands in close-up. But Polanski's boldest strokes of genius are in his creation and presentation of the ghetto and its inhabitants, especially as regards how he draws our attention. The soldiers giving a cigarette to an elderly Jewish man and the couple fighting over a can of stew are foregrounded. Seconds later, a corpse lies innocuously in the background. When Władek's father is accosted by two Germans, we see a couple of Polish women hastily get out of the way. When the shot changes to reveal the officer's back, the focus is suddenly on his gun holster – it draws our attention to things that give a little extra breadth and context to a scene.Central to The Pianist is Adrien Brody's portrayal of the title character. It's an incredibly sedate performance, with everything below the surface, utterly commanding of our attention despite its understatement. His emotions seem muted – when reunited with a friend the merest ghost of a smile plays across his lips, but by now we know the character and understand that this is a deep and sincere expression. Brody virtually carries the movie alone, and one of the unfortunate things about The Pianist is that not one other performance stands out at all, and the inadequacy of some of the supporting players does hurt the earlier scenes a little.But perhaps the greatest thing about The Pianist is in the fine construction of its story. Although most of it is based incredibly faithfully on Szpilman's own memoir, the adaptation by Ronald Harwood gives it a certain dramatic course. There is one intensely poignant scene, and one of the few entirely fictionalised episodes, in which Szpilman is being sheltered by Dorota, wakes to the sound of her cello-playing and, just for a moment, he can imagine what life would be like if she had been his wife. Finally, the scene where Hosenfeld asks Szpilman to play for him seems to be the key to the whole thing. It's as if every moment, every narrative line, points towards that scene. We've seen Germans forcing Jews to dance for their entertainment, which makes us first question Hosenfeld's motives. We've seen Szpilman's desperation to be reunited with a piano, his fingers making keystrokes in the air. In retrospect, this all seems a set-up for that encounter. In effect, The Pianist becomes a tale of a harrowing time, filtered through the beauty of a musical performance.","

"dbborroughs","7 August 2005","I don't know what to say about this move other than it really didn't movie me. Sure Adrian Brody is excellent as the Pianist of the title who hides out in Warsaw as the city is destroyed around him, but I never really connected to the story. I never really cared. I'm not sure if its poor film making or simply the fact that for me this seemed as been there and done that. Many of the things that I dislike in the well financed movies concerning the Holocaust came into play, in particular the fact that everything looks so nice as to be unreal. I also have the sense that the film is insisting that I like and respect it simply because of the subject matter. Its not that simple you have to give me characters and a good story before I care. Unfortunately while Brody is an excellent actor however I never connected to him. I never had a reason to care other than what happened was truly remarkable, which means this movie meant nothing to me. This film is a major disappointment","

Having already seen the film once I wanted to watch again so I felt like I was in a much better head space for the trip.Adrien Brody is a great fit for this part. And his lack of speech in the whole films shows just how horrifying the actions of the Germans to the Jewish community were.We are fully on this journey with him, and it's heartbreaking the journey he goes on, especially having to leave his family to go to their death on the train to treblinka.The scene where the German SS throw the wheelchair bound man out the window always sticks with me.I can't believe he went through all that to nearly get killed by his own men mistaking him for a German!It's a shame Szpilman wasn't able to repay Hosenfeld his kindness, but maybe that is karma after all!","

"tfrizzell","11 April 2003","Haunting adaptation based on the life of Polish Jew Wladyslaw Szpilman (portrayed by surprise Oscar-winner Adrien Brody), a somewhat sheltered young man who just takes life as it comes to him and of course has an uncanny knack for playing the piano. Timing is bad though for the titled character as the Nazi occupation of Poland is imminent and exile to death camps is a definite possibility. Brody and his family (parents Maureen Lipman and Frank Finley and siblings Ed Stoppard, Jessica Kate Meyer and Julia Rayner) quickly realize that things are going from bad to worse as life starts to spin out of control. Instructions in the newspaper foreshadow future hardships as the Star of David patches are demanded of all Jewish peoples to wear and then the dreaded ghettos follow. The film then becomes heart-wrenching, but a change occurs that allows Brody to be spared from the death camps. Now he must try to avoid the Nazi Regime and find an unbending will to survive against all odds. Help does come from fellow Jews and non-Nazi Germans. Emilia Fox makes a lasting impression as a woman that Brody falls in love with early on and then shows up again later in an important part. Thomas Kretschmann also stands out as a Nazi officer who has a change of heart during the film's latter moments (he is also linked to Brody because of his love for the piano). ""The Pianist"" is a film that fashions itself after Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". This production is better in spots than the earlier movie, but as a whole it is not quite as impressive. ""The Pianist"" has a more exact focus and ends up being more of a one-man showcase for Brody in its second half. ""Cast Away"" meets the Holocaust would probably be the way to describe ""The Pianist"" when all is said and done. A brilliant adapted screenplay by Oscar-winner Ronald Harwood brings the novel to life. Roman Polanski finally struck Oscar gold for his unbelievable direction here (his work is on par with Scorsese's in ""Gangs of New York"" for the most part). He quietly became the oldest winner ever in the Academy's history in that particular category. All the supporters have well-calculated parts, but Brody's character is the most dominant of course. However, Brody never does reach the level of Liam Neeson in ""Schindler's List"" or even past Oscar-winner Roberto Benigni in ""Life Is Beautiful"". In fact his character is not near as complicated as the film would like. He is trying to survive and his motivation is life. A case can be made quite easily for either Daniel Day-Lewis in ""Gangs of New York"" or Jack Nicholson in ""About Schmidt"" to have taken home the Best Actor Oscar instead, but that is in the past now (it is better not to go into Brody's acceptance speech at all). Also Brody did very little playing of the piano himself (he had a double for the much more difficult pieces) which pales him to past Oscar winners like Holly Hunter (""The Piano"") and Geoffrey Rush (""Shine""). Overall I do think ""The Pianist"" is an excellent film. I do think it is one of the stronger screenplay- and direction-driven films of recent memory.

"Sandcooler","5 May 2008","I don't go as far as saying holocaust movies are vanity projects of directors showing that they too can make an epic.But where Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" was somewhere way in the distance and ages ago,""The Pianist"" puts you in the action with the old trick of having a main character you care about.Bit by piece we get to see the downfall of the Jewish community in well,everywhere.Originally they just get discriminated and won't get to do anything to be anywhere,but are still members of society who usually don't get killed.Then it gets ugly.The ghettos,the incredible lack of everything,the random executions,I knew they existed but never have they seemed so sincere on behalf of the makers.What to say about an old man eating what appears to be liquid corn straight of the road?Eventually we learn yet again that the holocaust in fact,really made no sense.We're talking about Western Europe here,and it isn't even a long time ago.People were somewhat educated,thought for themselves when the Gestapo wasn't watching,and still most of them just went along with this crap.I was fearing a ""Night Of The Living Dead""-style ending,but this is based on an autobiography so that would have been impossible.Five years of hate packed in about two hours,and it works.","

"CinemaClown","1 May 2011","Helmed by a Holocaust survivor himself yet presenting an objective take on the disturbing subject matter, The Pianist is the most personal film renowned director Roman Polanski has made in his decades-spanning career for it is crafted with meticulous care n attention, told with immaculate simplicity & also happens to feature one of cinema's most extraordinary performances.Based on the memoir of the same name & set in Warsaw during the Second World War, The Pianist tells the story of Władysław Szpilman; a Polish-Jewish musician who after avoiding deportation to Nazi labour camps tries to elude capture by living in the ruins of his city. The plot details his miraculous survival against all odds which wouldn't have happened without the kindness of few compassionate humans.Directed by Roman Polanski, The Pianist does bring back the horrors of the Holocaust and never shies away from depicting the barbaric treatment millions of Jews underwent during Nazi occupation. But it's not a tale about someone who caused an uprising or put his life on the line to save others but through one person, it tries to capture what most people under same circumstances were trying to do: survive, no matter what it takes.Polanski does manage to infuse his own history into the story but never lets that distract his own vision for the picture at hand, and there in lies the true beauty of this survival story. It's arguably the finest film that he's made & certainly the most artistic. Adding more strength to the feature is the brilliantly-written screenplay that keeps the focus on our protagonist at all times & resonates the brutality that millions underwent through his own life story.Coming to the technical aspects, every single element only ends up enhancing the entire experience. Production Design team does a superb job in recreating the war-torn city & set pieces are refined to smallest of details. Cinematography makes impeccable use of camera in capturing every frame plus the cold colour temperature encapsulates the whole film with a bleak mood. Editing paces its 149 minutes of runtime with precision. And classical music is beautifully incorporated into the narrative.Another thing that seals the destiny of The Pianist is the exceptional performance by Adrien Brody in the role of Władysław Szpilman that simply exceeded every expectation. Perfectly capturing not just the feeling of hopelessness, loneliness, grief & living under constant fear but also the desperation, survival instinct & passion for music, what Brody delivers here is one of cinema's most memorable performances that still ranks as his best and his Academy Award win for this role was deserving in every manner.On an overall scale, The Pianist marks the career high moment for Roman Polanski & Adrien Brody, is an emotionally devastating & powerfully moving cinema that's worthy of all the accolades it has garnered so far, and is amongst the finest examples of historical drama in existence. It certainly isn't going to be an easy sit for most but you'll be a better person for having done because some films, no matter how difficult, deserve to be viewed, and Roman Polanski's magnum opus is definitely one of those cinematic treasures. Strongly recommended.","

"bob the moo","2 April 2006","Wladyslaw Szpilman is a musician living with his family in 1930's Warsaw. The rise of anti-Semitism starts to erode their civil liberties, making them have permits to work, requiring them to wear armbands that identify them as Jewish and generally treating them like second-class citizens and lesser people. This gradual slide becomes increasingly serious as all Jews are ordered into one small area of the city, where whole families are given flats with one or two small rooms to be shared among six or seven people. As the murders and control of the Jews continue, Szpilman is left to try and survive while the war rages across Europe.I didn't bother to watch this in the cinema despite the Oscars and rave reviews simply because I could never get my head in the right space to spend my time on a subject that was never going to be an easy watch. With it coming onto television recently though I decided it was worth a look and easily got into it, which the emotional power of the story doing enough to carry it along for the duration. At times it does feel like watching war porn, as Polanski wheels out one more shocking atrocity after another and occasionally feels like he is involved in a game of one-upmanship with other Holocaust movies (so we don't just have a man thrown out a window, but a disabled old man thrown out a window). This was a bit of a problem for me because I wanted more to the film that just the horror shown to me. However the film does do more than that and generally does enough to be as impacting in the study of Szpilman as it is in just yet again reminding us of the terrible things done in Europe barely 60 years ago.On both levels the film works while never being something you should try and watch expecting it to be a fun night in. Staying away from the front line of the war, the film focuses on the effects on the innocent, specifically Szpilman, who struggles to just stay alive. Up till this point the film had been a bit obvious, with bad things happening while the Szpilman's argue over what to do etc, with the film relying heavily on the shock and horror of what was happening. The rest of the film is more about him being left alone and hidden within Warsaw, which although slow is still impacting and engaging. At this point Brody also steps up and becomes much better than before, showing so much with just a horrified look but still containing enough of a character to be more than just our eyes. The rest of the cast are all good but generally it is Brody that carries the majority of the film. Polanski directs with a very good eye for the breakdown of this world and it looks totally of period and convincing.Overall then, not a film to come to if you are hoping for a cheerful night in but one to watch to gain a wider appreciation of the atrocities that can so easily be allowed to take place. Ethnic cleansing and wars continue even as I sit writing these words so those that think this film is just an unnecessary wallow in past horrors would do well to take a minute and think. At times it could have been better but it is impossible to ignore the power of the story and the impact of the delivery.","

This is Polanski's finest film by far.Adrien Brody was magnificent, and his performance made you feel you were right there with him.It wasn't a pretty picture, the outstanding cinematography notwithstanding. Bodies lie in the streets, and people just passed them by. People were shot for asking a simple question. A man was so hungry that when his attempt to steal a woman's soup resulted in it falling to the ground, he fell to the ground and lapped it up.Amidst all the carnage and deprivation, Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) managed to survive until the end. An amazing story.","

"=G=","29 May 2003","""The Pianist"" is doubtless well crafted and technically and artistically sound albeit naive and conventional. The film parses into one hour of a stereotypical and exploitive regurgitation of the horrors of the Nazi reign over the Warsaw ghetto, where every German soldier is more evil than Satan and every Jew a pathetic victim, and one hour of Brody living like a rat foraging for sustenance amid the Warsaw ruination. Only in the very end does the film introduce a bit of irony and a sympathetic Nazi after countless missed opportunities to breath something fresh into what is just another in a very long list of films about the infamous ghetto (Families torn apart, summary executions, etc.).  Brody delivers a fine performance as a pianist and the film's centerpiece but is not required to perform the range of emotion deserving of a little gold statuette. Overall, the film is worthwhile but shows us nothing new and exploits rather than honors the memory of those Polish Jews who died in the conflict. ""The Pianist"" will play best with those who have not yet had their fill of Warsaw ghetto films. (B)","

"MovieAddict2016","3 November 2004","Although I found ""The Pianist"" to be a commendable and fairly well-made effort, I did not find it to be a masterpiece.

I was shocked to see that the film had generated some fairly bad reviews on RottenTomatoes.com. I can understand where these authors are coming from -- ""The Pianist"" is a fine movie but uneven and not as great as it seems to think it is.At best I can compliment the good parts because some of them really are touching, but more often than not it's just too purposely sentimental to warm up to -- I never thought I'd say this but even Spielberg's version was less sugar-coated!Don't get me wrong, it's not glamorized and there are some brutal deaths, but it's just a bit too black-and-white and emotionally controlling for me to call it a masterpiece.3/5","

"richardchatten","30 December 2022","Despite the title Adrien Brody doesn't actually get to play the piano much during this film depicting the monstrous institutionalised bullying on an industrial scale that characterised the German occupation of Poland. The second half of the film also largely abandons dialogue for sound effects (what dialogue there is is in German).Growing steadily more gaunt and dishevelled Brody staggers through a Warsaw transformed into a ghost town scattered with corpses while subject to the casual brutality of uniformed thugs who plainly regard it all as a bit of a lark and coping with the hostility of native anti-semites.Director Polanski (90 next August) keeps on going from strength to strength. Originally an actor in the war films of Andrzej Wadja, here he finally addresses head-on the childhood traumas in occupied Poland which obviously lay behind his other films (like Brody the young Polanski was used for target practise by Nazis.When they finally appear the Russians actually get pretty short shift, and considering their recent activities in Ukraine, the observation about the Poles that ""No one thought they'd hold out so long!"" must currently be giving Putin sleepless nights.","

"JamesHitchcock","20 January 2017","There have been innumerable films about World War II, but relatively few about the Holocaust, a subject which, at least for the first few decades after the war, seemed to daunt film-makers by its very enormity. Since the 1980s, however, there have been some fine attempts to come to terms with the most notorious crime of the twentieth century, including Pakula's ""Sophie's Choice"" and Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is another to add to this list.The film is based on the autobiography of Władysław Szpilman, a Jewish pianist, who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland. (As one character points out, Szpilman's surname is an appropriate one; it is a Polonised form of ""Spielmann"", the German for ""musician""). In September 1939 the Szpilman family are living in relative middle-class comfort in Warsaw when they learn that the country has been invaded by Germany. The film then traces the way in which the situation of Poland, and especially of its Jewish community, deteriorates throughout the course of the war- the passing of anti-Jewish laws, the creation of the Warsaw Ghetto in November 1940 and finally the deportations to the concentration camps beginning in 1942. By a stroke of chance Szpilman is separated from his family when they are deported to Treblinka extermination camp. For a time he becomes a slave labourer, but manages to escape and is sheltered by non-Jewish friends linked to the Polish resistance, surviving while thousands are dying around him and while his city is gradually turned into a wasteland of rubble.A key scene comes towards the end of the film. Much of the city, including the building in which Szpilman was sheltering, has been destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising of August 1944, and Szpilman is desperately trying to hide in a ruined building when he is discovered by a German officer named Wilm Hosenfeld. Hosenfeld guesses that Szpilman is Jewish, but takes pity on him and spares his life, even bringing him food and giving him a coat to help him survive.Szpilman's story had a deep personal significance for Polanski, himself a Polish Jew who managed to survive the war in hiding, although other members of his family, including his mother, died. It is therefore unsurprising that it has a greater emotional resonance than many of Polanski's earlier films, which can often be rather emotionally cool. Szpilman is a gifted musician, but his survival has very little to do with his talent and a great deal to do with the kindness of others and with sheer luck. It is a role which called for a superb actor, and Polanski was fortunate enough to find one in the shape of Adrien Brody, who won a well-deserved ""Best Actor"" Oscar. (Strangely enough, Brody was not the director's first choice for the role- that was Joseph Fiennes, who was unavailable). Brody's Szpilman becomes a sort of Everyman figure, a tragic version of Chaplin's Little Tramp, stumbling his way through a city which has been reduced to a vision of Hell on Earth. As Roger Ebert put it, he is not a fighter or a hero but a survivor.Polanski himself won the ""Best Director"" award. The film was nominated for Best Picture, but lost to ""Chicago"". ""The Pianist"" is a harrowing record of man's inhumanity to man, but it is also a film with a message of hope in that it shows how even unspeakable barbarity like that of the Nazis cannot altogether extinguish man's better instincts, shown by the kindness and bravery of Szpilman's friends and his defiant rendition of Chopin's Grande Polonaise Brillante at the end. It is one of the most moving films about the war that I know, comparable in this respect to either Pakula's or Spielberg's. 9/10","

"Pedro_H","1 February 2005","Roman Polanski is something of a genius for being in the middle of world history. Even if he had never made a film in his life his autobiography would still have been fascinating and history packed. I won't try and summate it in detail, but it involves an escape not unlike the one presented here on film! Having turned down Schindler's List (for reasons much noted elsewhere) he decides to make this as his tribute to the anti-Jewish horrors of WWII. Interesting.Despite the awards (all deserved) this is not what you might call a ""fat"" film. It has one main theme: ""self preservation"" in a world gone mad and that limits my sympathy and involvement. Indeed the protagonist (Adrian Brody) has something that people can envy even in his darkest hour - a great musical talent.The question I ask myself is how much of this lifesaver influences his decisions? While many gave up or joined in the resistance movement, Brody watches from the window: very much a curious and non Hollywood approach. Brave but not to everyone's taste.The real Warsaw Ghetto was featured in the great Granada documentary series ""The World at War"" (quite frankly the most amazing piece of historical television ever created - if you can rent it do so) and nothing can be as shocking as the real pictures. However this is a close second.The early scenes of family life are like the scenes from the Titanic, we know what those on screen don't and we feel like calling out and warning them! In many ways the information is soft peddled and tokenised. We do not see the actual horrors of the death camps and even post war the survivors look too healthy to be believable. The only bum note in the entire movie.Although I had nothing to do with the making of this film I am proud of it. I am proud that millions of people have been educated and will continue to be educated about the horrors of war and what man does to man. But I didn't really enjoy it very much and I have no desire to see it again despite having some wonderful pieces of cinematography.","

And it is a Polanski in which Adrien Brody is brilliant. For the art to discover each color of silent fight. For the strange occasions in which death is expected answer.

He succeeded on making us understand how his main character was feeling and made it easier for us to follow his story. The interpretation of Adrien Brody who played as Wladyslaw Szpilman was simply amazing and he deserved the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role.

"henry8-3","5 May 2020","Follows a Jewish pianist (Brody) trying to survive in the Warsaw ghetto during WW2.A film broadly of 2 parts, the first covering the arrival of the nazis and its impact on the Jewish community most particularly Brody and his family. This is full of tension brought about the German atrocities and as the family descends further and further into hell. In many ways this is the most harrowing part of the film in that there are so many vulnerable family members to worry about as they move from disbelief and outrage to fear and some form of resignation.The bulk of the film though is a slow but fairly tense passage following Brody hiding and surviving alone in the empty ghetto, his life without food and warmth punctuated by moments of terror.The film is tense and like Schindler's List you do have this dreadful sense throughout of disbelief that this could have happened by people to people. Brody is very good in the lead and overall it is a considerable achievement - important to be sure. I just found that some passages took long to make their point - sorry.","

"diane-34","12 March 2005","Fortunately my wife convinced me to see this film on TV several nights ago; initially I was reluctant because I thought that it would end up being too tough for a overly sensitive softy like myself-how wrong I was! Polanski's film was not what I had expected; in all the publicity surrounding his return to films, I had failed to grasp the substance of the film. In hindsight this surprises me because for many years I have been curious as to why film makers had not focused on the extraordinary events of the Warsaw Ghetto and its eventual destruction by the Nazis. I have always thought that this event was one of the most powerful of a string of events that have been overlooked by film makers for years. The enormity of all that happened from '38 to '45 seem to have prevented people from mining the history of those years. It is conceivable that producers feel there is a fatigue clause at work here, meaning that there is possibly a feeling by producers that the public might be tired of non-military war films. Another possibility concerns the Jewish people themselves-a concern that they do not want this terribly painful history to be mined simply to provide fodder for film makers. Whatever the reason, there is to my mind a noticeable absence of films about these monumental but painful events of the mid twentieth century.Even given the drawbacks associated with watching a film on the small screen, this movie immediately gave the impression that it had the touch of genius about it. Polanski's superb direction; Brody's superb acting and Edelman's brilliant cinematography impart the stamp of excellence on the film. I am a film viewer who watches films as collections of images so Edelman's work knocked me out! The beauty of the clarity and darkness of the camera work was wonderful to watch. POlanski's shot selection of course allowed Edelman ample canvas upon which to paint in those wonderful grays and muted colours that were eventually seen on the screen. Diane and I have the tape of the film and it will definitely be watched many times in the future. In short, the film is as good as the awards that it justifiably received.","

This movie's telling of the methodical NAZI takeover and extermination of the Jewish people is brutal and chilling in detail. It portrays the crescendo of evil inflicted upon those people as their rights slowly were stripped away through the eyes of Wladyslaw Szpilman. This sugarcoats absolutely nothing. It sears many horrific scenes into your brain at the lack of any ounce of humanity by the NAZI's. It is of the highest quality in terms of production, screenplay, editing and of course the musical moments. This is top quality on this subject. Do not watch.....on a whim.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","27 February 2008","""The Pianist"" is a film that is impossible to dislike. In fact, it may be impossible to love it as well. It's a traumatic and difficult biographical account of one of the many unbelievable Holocaust survival stories. What makes ""Pianist"" stand out, however is the traumatic realism, the way that the story evolves to strike an emotional chord in regards to the Nazi's crimes and the unique role of music in the film.""The Pianist"" is the Oscar-winning best adapted screenplay from the autobiography of Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), an accomplished Jewish pianist in Warsaw right as World War II strikes. The film plays out as several scenes following a timeline from the initial invasion to the Warsaw ghetto to Szpilman's many hideouts in the city throughout the war. While the true sense of time is skewed and thus the true agony of Szpilman's isolation unrealized, the timeline clearly shows how the Jews and everyone in Warsaw for that matter had their lives transformed.What makes this film so effective is the way Oscar winners Ronald Harwood (screenplay), but mostly director Roman Polanski, go right for your heartstrings. The Nazis are portrayed as cold-blooded killers. There is no emotional build-up or excessive suspense in the film's violent moments. It is sudden and mechanical, leaving you wondering how anyone could do such a thing, when the fact of the matter was that's exactly how it happened: many times arbitrary, heartless killing. The whole effect that Polanski has created with the violence being viewed by Szpilman and his family through windows, isolated from the mêlée, is very effective in the way that it connects with how the viewer is very much isolated from the true nature of the violence. Polanski conditions you to be afraid every time Szpilman looks out the window that violence might occur, which is exactly what Szpilman was: very curious about what was going on, but truly afraid. The effect is brilliant.The films third Oscar winner, Brody, doesn't give an emotionally moving performance per say, but his performance is award-worthy in its realism through exquisite use of non-verbal skills and his natural demeanor. You can tell how the war has transformed him as a person through each stage--from day one to the final moments of the film.If there's a weakness to the film, it's the fact that it doesn't spend enough time grasping Szpilman as a pianist. There is no sense as to how important his playing is or why he plays. Instead, the focus is more on the unfolding the events of WWII. While the idea the film presents of him being a pianist simply because that's what he knows to do is effective towards the end, a greater understanding of what playing the piano means to him would have been ideal in the beginning.""The Pianist"" is a tremendous achievement in terms of successfully telling a often repeated story in a way that is uniquely effective. It focuses on the aspect of the Holocaust that speaks to perseverance, basic survival in a life of fear that plays out outside your window. It is a tough film, but it's a good one.","

"claudio_carvalho","18 January 2004","Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a Polish Jewish pianist very famous in Warsaw. When Germany invades Poland, his wealthy family and him are sent to the Warsaw Ghetto. Them they are sent to Treblinka, but Szpilman escapes in the train station. He struggles to survive, hidden in the most different places and depending on friend's sympathy to stay alive. He survives the war and died in the year 2000. This movie is a super production, very well directed by Roman Polanski and having an outstanding performance of Adrien Brody. However, this sad story does not present anything that was not showed before, like, for example, `Schindler`s List' did some years ago. There is a good movie (`Uprising' (2001), TV), showing better the events of the Warsow Ghetto uprising, but the intention of `The Pianist' is to show the true saga of Szpilman. I can perfectly understand that Jewish persons, who are majority in the cinema industry, have a great interest in keeping alive the atrocities of the Second World War. But these movies are very repetitive, showing horrible dramas of the most different survivors, or persons who died. However, there are so many other massacres of races to be explored through the human history and unfortunately they are not showed in movies like the murder of Jewish in the WWII. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): `O Pianista' (`The Pianist')","

"danielmanson","4 September 2021","Well that's quite a good film isn't it! Really not what I expected from a film called ""the pianist"". I've put this off for so long, because I simply thought it would be really dull. But wow, I've been wrong this whole time.The first hour is spectacular. The camera shots, the acting, the story and the feel of the film was all perfect. It really captured the realism of what it would have been like in them times. The one thing that was done perfectly throughout was that it captured the emotion of the characters and illustrated it so well.Speaking of characters. The arc of Adrien Brody's character was exceptional. Everything about him was done perfectly and it illustrated everything it needed to.Got to give props to Adrien Brody as well, phenomenal performance. Honestly one of the best I've seen in a long time.Only real negative I have to say is that I thought the final hour or so dragged at parts and it didn't need to be as long as it needed to. But this is nit picking.If you haven't seen please do. It's moving, emotional and just damn right amazing.","

"TxMike","26 June 2004","This movie is too long for what it depicts, one Jew's struggle to survive Nazi-occupied Warsaw during the second world war. The movie doesn't cover any new ground, the audience doesn't learn anything new. However, being a personal project for the director may account for its length. I hadn't planned to see it, because if you've seen one holocaust film, you've seen them all. And that is not in any way intended to minimize the horror of the mistreatment of the Jews, but how many times does a person need to see it reinacted to grasp the message? It happened, it was bad, we all need to do our part to see that nothing like that happens again. But I saw it for Adrien Brody, the hawkish actor who won the best actor Oscar for his performance. And, after seeing it, I believe it was deserved. The first hour of the movie established the setting and danger, the middle hour spends too much time showing the protagonist trying to survive, hiding in bombed-out buildings, scratching for food. We know it all happened, but if you show everything, the movie is 6 years long!!  The movie starts with actual black and white film footage of 1939 Warsaw, and we see its residents leading normal lives for that period. Then, cut to the movie, the pianist is playing for a live radio broadcast when bombs or artillery shells begin to explode and all Jewish families begin their fights for survival. Forced to wear identifying arm bands, eventually they were banished to their own ghetto, then the trains came. SPOILERS are contained in the rest of my comments, for my own recollection, please read no further. The last half hour of the movie pulls everything together. The pianist is helped by a German soldier who discovers him, has him play piano for him, then secretly brings him food as the war winds down. When the Russians finally come to Warsaw, the few remaining Jews are out of danger, the Germans are imprisoned, and eventually the pianist is playing again for the radio, and the final scene is his playing a concert before a live audience. The pianist was a real person, this movie is a true story based on his book.","

"truemythmedia","11 November 2019","If I'm being honest, I think Polanski winning the best director Oscar for this film is sort of like Scorsese winning his Oscar for ""The Departed""; both awards feel a bit like consolation Oscars. What do I mean by that? Well, I don't believe that this is the best film Polanski has put out; in fact, I wouldn't even put it in his top three. It is a good film, however, and with all the amazing movies that Polanski produced during his career I'm glad that he found a bit of recognition, even if it is for a film that isn't as polished as some of his others.Polanski himself said that his was the most personal film he's ever made, and there's good reason for that. Polanski was in his preteens when WWII washed over Poland, and he, like Wladyslaw Szpilman, survived the ghettos while their families were less fortunate (Polanski's mother was killed in Auschwitz). ""The Pianist"" shows a side of the holocaust that we rarely see, for it's not from the perspective of the camps which we see most of the film, but from the perspective of one who has escaped the camps and is still forced to live in a prison of isolation and degradation.As a whole, I think the story told in this movie is wonderful, and since it is based on a true story, it's hard to criticize it too much for structure, but at the same time, I do feel that this movie starts to drag in the second act. Most of the truly disturbing stuff happens in the first half of this film. The parts where Szpilman is separated from his family, the purging of the ghetto, the moving to concentration camps... all of that stuff happens within the first hour and fifteen minutes, and the last hour of this movie is mostly focused on Szpilman trying to stay quiet in apartments, trying to figure out what's gong on outside, and struggling to get over sickness. By no means does the story ever get boring- it's still fascinating, but the horrors of the first half of this movie are far more memorable than those in the second half.","

"Holt344","28 November 2018","This movie got everything right from the cinematography to the soundtrack, just pure perfection.
It was realistic, almost too realistic as it's depressing but in a good way. It feels real and you feel immersed from start to finish and it's because the director, Roman Polanski's knowledge and understanding of the holocaust and also the incredible acting performance of Adrien Brody, just stunning to look at. Seeing his transformation into a holocaust survivor and giving 100% into the role made this one of the best performances I've seen this year.
I'm glad that they showed that there were lots of Germans helping the Jews.They managed to create something more than a movie, this is pure art.","

"yoyomagoo","24 March 2003","I despise the term overrated (partly because of its often use on IMDB) but this movie is the dictionary definition of the term. How did it win those oscars? Why it is in the top 250? I don't know.Polanski's tribute to the holocaust is a largely pedestrian affair that suffers from a lack of style and tautness. The inclusion of many scenes in the movie is mysterious considering the fact they hold little relevance to either the holocaust or the Brody's character's story. The film therefore feels bloated and self-important. Polanski does not treat the subject matter with any opinion or style- and just shows us what happens before casually strolling onto the next scene. Polanski would argue that this is because the subject matter does not need any style or opinion added to it, which is fair enough. However the problem with this is, that it is extremely dull for the audience. The ""powerful"" elements of the movie are few and far between, bluntening their impact. Also, towards the middle of the film, there seems to be a genuinely scary lack of substance and we get treated to lots of long shots contrasted with close-ups. What this is supposed to tell us, is also a mystery. While the movie must be commended for its treatment of the subject matter and Adrien Brody's excellent performance, it feels more guided rather than directed. Its casual attitude to the violence seems mundane rather than shocking and there is nothing here that Steven Spielberg didn't do better in Schindler's List. Essentially dull, rather than powerful, only the last 45 minutes make this film memorable. 6/10","

"LW-08854","27 December 2023","Revisiting this film I found it really holds up very well. The film opens with invasion and the coming occupation of Warsaw, a family must now decide whether to flee, and if so where to go? Our main character is a middle-class musician, cultured, well dressed, handsome but his world is now turned up side down. The early scenes of the city apartments being emptied, of glass smashing, radio falling silent and distress are all really well directed and acted. We next move now to the Warsaw ghetto and the casual brutality and contempt the occupiers now display to the inhabitants. Our main character is still able to work as a pianist but his life now is looking increasingly precarious. The family fortune dwindles, money has little value anymore. You really have to give high praise to the costumes, props and locations, I really felt myself there living it. This is an English language film but you don't really hear any English accents which at least helps. It has a bit of a desaturated look but it's still very much something shot on film and not at all like some digital films we get now. The story is very much that of the pianist, everything that happens we see through his eyes. The thuggery and terror brought by the Nazis is revolting and shocking. There's a tiny bit of CGI but mostly it's all in camera and I have to give the production values very high praise. At times I did slightly loose track of what year it was, maybe that's deliberate. I also found our main character very passive, there's no mad heroics, no impassioned speeches from him, he's probably too shocked for anything remotely like that. As I said it's very much his story, we have no sense of who's winning or losing the war, no cut aways to generals looking at maps or giving out orders really. There's some great physical acting in here too, our main character's appearance change so much as he lives a more and more hunted and animal like life. He is truly just a survivor in an increasingly dangerous landscape. We see some acts of defiance and resistance, his life though is terribly lonely and he carries with him his love of music throughout his life on the run.","

"Smells_Like_Cheese","1 November 2004","Man, I can not get this film out of my head. It is so rare that a movie can affect me the way ""The Pianst"" did. The last movie that did that was ""Casino"". I was really tired when I was watching the movie. It was almost midnight, so I was thinking that I'll start watching and I'll finish it in the morning. Did I? No, indeed I did not stop watching. I couldn't stop it. I just wanted to see what would happen next. I cried during ""Schindler's List"", I sobbed in this film. Everything that happens in this film is so sad. Adrien Brody does a remarkable job of acting in this film. I would very highly recommend this film. Especially if you are a history buff. Please, I think this film should be in the top 10 best films of all time.I looked on the message boards you know and some other user comments that didn't enjoy this film much, they criticized Adrien Brody's performance and say that he was boring and only showed emotions that are easy to act. Please, you have got to be kidding me. This man portrayed the total feeling of hopelessness, being alone, being hated. I one time had an audition in high school like this to see if I could improvise, and the way I imagined this feeling is like in dodgeball where you have no one else on your team and you're the only one left standing, yet on the other team there is 20 big men that are just waiting to wack that ball at you. Adrien couldn't have done a better job, I was so frightened for him and cried for him during the whole film while he was one the run.Roman Polanski as the director, he himself escaped the terrors of being a prisoner in The Holocaust, yet he lost his mother and other family members. Yes, I'm sure this film must have been hard to re create for him, but he was probably the only director that could have done this movie as brilliantly as he did. He created this story and made it so effective, I called up my mom and told her that I loved her so much because we take so many things for granted. True, this isn't the 1930's or 40's, and we are in America. But it's still frightening to think that human beings are capable of that much hate and being so brutal to another human. World War II is one of the most frightening wars in history, if you read more about The Holocaust, you get more into it and you should. If you are not interested, then watch this film. It's a must see, otherwise how else will we learn from our mistakes? The Pianist is a beautiful and extremely dark tale about a man and the struggle to survive. The ending is so powerful and moving to know that sometimes one man can make a difference in a crowd of so many and I'm not talking about Adrien Brody's character. You'll see what I mean.10/10","

In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust. This movie came close to Schindlers list in depicting the horrors of Holocaust. Brody puts in a marvelous and utterly touching performance. The story depicts the emotional and cultural breakdown of persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them. Excellent acting by Brody.","

"baumer","27 March 2003","I can remember when this film came out I was adamantly against seeing it. I had my preconceived notions that it would be some other heroic Jewish Holocaust film where good triumphs over evil and in between we would see some brutal atrocities committed by the Germans to add some flavour.How wrong I was.This is one of the best films I have ever seen and what it did to me I cannot describe in words. But in a nutshell, it moved me, made me cry, made me feel like I was in the Polish ghetto in 1940, and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as I walked out of the theater and thanked God that I live in the free society that I do. Roman Polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby but this is his crowning achievement. I think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years Oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film. I believe that the Oscar's are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else, so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year, it tells you that it should have won best picture but the Weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone, hence a charlatan like Chicago takes top prize. Sorry for the digression here but when you compare a ""film"" like Chicago to a masterpiece like The Pianist, there really is one clear cut winner. They handed out the statue to the wrong movie.The Pianist follows up and coming piano player Wlad Spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos, surviving only by the kindness of strangers. I think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because Spielzman is a man that we can all relate to. He is not a hero, he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge. He is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. He is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can. Only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide. And this is how I related to him. If put in his position, how would I react? Exactly the way he did. This is a man that had everything taken from him. His livelihood, his family, his freedom and almost his life. There is no time for heroics here. Adrien Brody embodies the spirit of Spielzman and his win at this years Oscars was one of the happiest moments I have had watching the festivities. His speech was even better but that is a topic for another time.Ultimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the German soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes I've witnessed. With very little dialogue, it is in the eyes, the face, the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know. I think it is this scene that won Brody his Oscar. This is one of the all time great performances.I think Polanski spoke from the heart here. He has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other. I think The Pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done, Chicago will be forgotten the way Ordinary People was forgotten and when people talk about the film The Pianist, they will do so with reverence and respect. This is a cinematic masterpiece.10 out of 10","

"FilmOtaku","28 April 2003","The Pianist is the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, at the time Poland's most acclaimed pianist whose life is transformed during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw beginning in 1939.  The film spans several years and maps his many personal trials in addition to providing the perspectives of his family, rebel factions and sympathizers.Brilliantly directed by Roman Polanski and starring an amazing Adrien Brody, The Pianist is bound to garner comparisons to Schindler's List, for obvious reasons.  However similar the subject matter, the approach is different. While Schindler's List was filmed in a beautiful, crisp black and white that offered many incredible images, The Pianist was filmed with almost muted color.  Schindler's List featured what has been argued as a complicated hero.  Oskar Schindler did save many Jews, but not without battling his own materialistic demons first.  The Pianist's Szpilman is a sympathetic character throughout.  His plight was desperate, and the demons he fought were over his own guilt in surviving a fight that eventually turns into a primal will to live.Polanski does not spare the viewer any grief with his film.  The horrific scenes between the Nazis and the Warsaw Jews were more terrifying and horrible than any horror/suspense movie I have seen in some time, possibly ever.  The humiliation and complete loss is wrenching.  In several scenes, Jews are lined up in the middle of the night and subjected to either torture or death.  In one case, a woman asks of a Nazi officer, ""What will happen to us?"" and is promptly shot point blank in the head.  The camera does not flinch or subdue any of these atrocities.A mention must be made of Brody's performance.  Having only previously seen Brody in two other films, Spike Lee's ""Summer of Sam"" and Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" (a part that was supposed to be his launch into stardom before his part was unfortunately cut drastically) I knew his potential was great.  After his Oscar win, I viewed this movie with more criticism than I normally would have and he certainly did not disappoint.  He transcended my expectations.  His physical transformation was amazing, but more importantly, he conveyed the sorrow of this man shockingly well - in both verbal and non-verbal contexts.  It will be very interesting to see what kind of opportunities this role will afford him, and the kinds of roles he will accept.Something worth mentioning is the affect this movie had on the audience with whom I viewed this film.  Normally, when a film ends, the regular hardcore filmsters like myself will stay and watch the credits in their entirety. The rest of the audience stands up and leaves, usually to the chagrin of the remaining enthusiasts.  This was one of the few times I have seen a film at a theater where not one person stood to leave during the final credits. It wasn't until the house lights came up at the end did people begin to disperse.  Personally, I hightailed it out of the theater the second the lights came on because not only was my face a mess from crying during the film (Tammy Faye comes to mind) but I had this overwhelming need for an emotional release, so when I reached my car I sat and wept for about five minutes.  It has been years since I have watched a film that upset me to that extent. Conversely, while discussing this film with my brother, (someone who loves movies as much and has similar tastes as I do) he mentioned that while he thought the movie was excellent, he wasn't as profoundly emotionally effected as I was.  After thinking about this for a couple of days, I realized the difference: The music.  As a classical music enthusiast and erstwhile musician, the thought of not being able to enjoy, much less play the music you love is a tragic one.  Then the emotional outpouring that comes when you return to it - there aren't words to describe how intense that is.  Not having the same appreciation for this musical genre, one will be able to sympathize with the physical and emotional tribulations, but perhaps not in the musical sense.The Pianist was truly an astonishing film.  I was riveted from start to finish and so emotionally affected that I couldn't even consider writing a review until a week later.  Having said that, I am filing this away with my list of movies which include Schindlers List and Philadelphia, as films that I love but cannot rewatch for a long time after due to their intensely emotional content.--Shelly","

"jotix100","21 January 2003","The Pianist is an incredible film in many aspects. Roman Polanski's account of the survival of the pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is a document about how one man can overcome the worst possible situations in a world gone completely mad around him.The only fault one can find with the adaptation of Mr. Szpilman's story by playwright Ronald Harwood, is the fact that we never get to know the real Wladyslaw Szpilman, the man, as some of the comments made to this forum also have indicated.There is a very interesting point raised by the the pianist's father who upon reading something in the paper, comments about how the Americans have forgotten them. Well, not only the Americans, but the rest of the world would not raise a finger to do anything for the people that were being imprisoned and made to live in the confined area of Warsaw. The exterminating camps will come later. What is amazing in the film, is the frankness in which director Polanski portrays the duplicity of some Jews in the ghetto. The fact that Jews were used to control other Jews is mind boggling, but it was a fact, and it's treated here matter of factly. Had this been made by an American director, this aspect would have never surfaced at all. Yet, Mr. Polanski and Mr. Harewood show us that all was not as noble and dignified as some other films have treated this ugly side of war.  Wladyslaw Szpilman, as played by Adrien Brody, is puzzling sometimes, in that we never get to know what's in his mind. He's a man intent in not dying, but he's not a fighter. He accepts the kindness extended to him. He never offers to do anything other than keep on hiding, which is a human instinct. He will never fight side by side with the real heroes of the ghetto uprising. His role is simply to witness the battle from his vantage point in one of the safe houses across the street from where the action takes place.Adrien Brody is an interesting actor to watch. As the pianist of the story he exudes intelligence. There is a scene where Szpilman, in one of the safe houses he is taken, discovers an upright piano. One can see the music in his head and he can't contain himself in moving his fingers outside the closed instrument playing the glorious music from which he can only imagine what it will sound in his mind.The supporting cast is excellent. Frank Findlay, a magnificent English actor is the father of the pianist and Maureen Lipman, another veteran of the stage, plays the mother with refined dignity.In watching this film one can only shudder at the thought of another conflict that is currently brewing in front of our eyes. We wonder if the leaders of the different factions could be made to sit through a showing of The Pianist to make them realize that war is hell.","

"classicsoncall","3 February 2013","Fortunately, I'm able to keep my personal feelings about Roman Polanski compartmentalized enough to say that this was a remarkable film. I've read many comparisons between ""The Pianist"" and ""Schindler's List"" on this board, and even though the films are quite different, the overpowering portrayals of Man's inhumanity against Man will leave the viewer forever affected. Adrien Brody's Best Actor award was stunningly achieved here, as his character arcs through an incredible series of circumstances to barely survive life in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II. What little I knew of director Polanski outside of his marriage to Sharon Tate, the grisly Manson murders, and his rape conviction in the late 1970's, was put into an entirely different perspective when I learned about his own life in the Polish Ghetto. Much of what we see in the film must emanate from his own unique experience as a child during the War and experiencing Nazi atrocity first hand. I don't envy anyone who survived that experience enduring the painful daily memories of those times.Given the film's title, I guess I was somewhat surprised by the paucity of musical sequences, though what was offered was artistically presented. Particularly poignant was the scene when Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) was left to hide in an apartment where a piano was available, and he mimed his way through a selection from memory by the need to maintain silence.Many years following the end of World War II, a single film cannister simply marked ""The Ghetto"" was discovered, revealing valuable insight into how the Nazi propaganda machine attempted to manipulate public opinion about 'rich' Jews who lived in luxury alongside fellow Jews in squalid conditions. Even more intimate details of life in the Warsaw Ghetto are presented in ""Shtikat Haarchion"" (A Film Unfinished), describing conditions that are even more horrific than those depicted in ""The Pianist"" or ""Schindler's List"", if that can even be imagined. These movies exist for a higher calling as a constant reminder that the term ""Never Again"" be one to constantly take seriously in an ever increasingly dangerous world.","

"Quinoa1984","16 January 2003","The Pianist tells the story of such a man in war time Poland, played by Adrien Brody, who from start to finish sees his life literally getting worse and worse and worse- starts off with new rules from the Nazis, then the stars on the arms, followed by the Warsaw ghetto, and while there he could play in the restaurant, that too soon ended, as the trains arrived and took his family and anyone else he knew away.  During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  This is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).In conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski's best, a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or.  Great music too. A+","

"dtb","9 January 2004","This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :-) -- rightly so, since title character Wladyslaw Szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways!  It's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off.  It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away.  (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there's no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest `safe house' has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head.  Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I've seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD's flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody's job often was), I'd be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won! (Besides, the rest of the 2002 Best Actor nominees already won Oscars -- this time it was dark horse Brody's turn! :-)","

"Nazi_Fighter_David","6 September 2005","'The Pianist' is definitively an inspiring epic that celebrates the tenacity and fortitude of the human spirit... It is a remarkable tale of human survival sensitively brought to life by Polanski... The film carries us to the horrible reign of terror, where condemned people wearing the emblem of humiliation and oppression, are deprived of their rights, their human values and dignity, before being shipped to 'labor camps.' In Polanski's movie all the conventional elements of the drama are at peaks of excellence: Family union: When a father has to bargain to buy a single piece of caramel and divide it in six pieces to share it with each member of his family...Starvation: When a ghetto inhabitant assaults a helpless woman for a bowl of soup... Confusion: When a distraught woman wails on a platform because she smothered the cries of her baby with her hand...Love: When a young musician turns to his younger sister and utters with sad regret, ""I wish I knew you better."" Survival: When one man observes the war through his hide-outs around the city...Cruelty: When an old man in a wheelchair is thrown off the balcony by the Nazis because he failed to stand upon their entrance...Fear: When a talented musician sits down at the old piano, and pretends to play his music, keeping his fingers flowing with control above the vertical ivories...Discrimination: When bored Nazi guards entertain themselves by forcing grotesquely mismatched old and sick couples to dance to a Jewish street band by the ghetto gate...Horror: When condemned Jewish workers lie face-down in the street, while one SS guard walks down the line, shooting without remorse each one in the back of the head... Isolation: When a fugitive emerges from his harrowing hiding place and walks through a field of deserted ruins exactly like the last man alive on Polish soil..Adrien Brody gives an absolutely moving performance (based on descriptive facial expressions) as the Polish composer and pianist who stays alive as a Jew, and remains true to his ideals... Brody captures the character's desperation, his anger and grief, his willpower and perseverance, his passion and love of music... Polanski gives us the chance to better know his shock and disbelief, his ordeal and tragedy, his hope for fairness and humanity...Nominated for seven Academy Awards, this captivating drama went on to win three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay... Once Brody took the stage to accept his Oscar, he was so overwhelmed with happiness, that he swept the gorgeous Academy Award-winning Halle Berry off her feet with a long, steamy kiss...","

"baba44713","7 April 2005","I remember seeing ""Schindler's list"" about ten years ago, and I remember how weird I felt for being almost completely unmoved by it. Although it showed the horrors of holocaust quite realistically, somehow it all seemed just a bit too fake and exaggerated. Characters were a bit off (I still can't decide who was more over the top, Schindler or Goeth), fake sentimentalism was all over the place, . While it was a work of art and an important reminder of true events that shouldn't be forgotten, on emotional level it just somehow failed to deliver.Enter ""The Pianist"". With no Spielberg around to put his trademark sappy material, we finally have a movie that shows the true horror and tragedy of Jewish people in World War II. The story is told through the eyes of one man - Wladislaw Szpielman, Jewish pianist who works in a radio station in Warsaw during the German occupation of Poland. Together with him we watch his world getting torn apart, witness his family being taken away, his existence being reduced to bare essentials. Brody gives a subtle yet spectacular performance, his best work yet. And never once are we reminded that we are watching a movie. Everything is shown from Szpielman's point of view, and it is all very gritty and realistic. While Spielberg's rendition of German atrocities always had a slightly staged feel to augment their dramatic purpose, here they are so true to life there impact is much greater - you watch and are being reminded in horror that this things actually happened.While being very hard to watch sometimes, this is a movie that ""Schindler's List"" was supposed to be. This movie doesn't judge anybody, or tries to explain anything - it shows historical events as a reflection of one man's fate, making a powerful testimony that stays with you long after the beautiful last shot and the end credits are over.","

"Xanan","20 January 2003","The Pianist is an account of the true life experience of a Polish pianist during WW2, in the context of the deportation of the Jewish community to the Ghetto of Warsaw, a setting virtually absent from all films inspired on WW2.
Polanski (himself a child survivor of the Krakow and Warsaw ghettos) could have described in more detail the legendary, desperate fighting of the Jewish resistance in the ghetto of Warsaw, or the horrific mass extermination in concentration camps. Instead, the film gains in intensity by displaying the war from the pianist's own point of view (through windows, half-opened doors, holes in the walls - with big emphasis on the use of ""point of view shooting"" by the cameraman). One cannot help feeling disturbed by the most enthralling scenes of the film, as the isolated pianist tries to ensure his survival in the ghetto and ruins of Warsaw, hiding and fleeing, moving from one bombed house to the next, gradually becoming a shadow of his former self, hungry and afraid (merit largely attributed to the extraordinary performance by Adrien Brody, who visibly loses half of his weight throughout the film).Does the pianist raise any sympathy from the audience? Not immediately, in my view. The pianist is more than often a drifting character, almost a witness of other people's and his own horrors. He seems to float and drift along the film like a lost feather, with people quickly appearing and disappearing from his life, some helping generously, others taking advantage of his quiet despair, always maintaining an almost blank, dispassionate demeanour. One may even wonder why we should care in the least about this character. But we do care. That is, I believe, the secret to this film's poetry.In one of the strongest scenes, towards the end, a German officer forces the pianist to play for his life, in an episode that suddenly brings a much lighter, beautifully poetic shade to the film (this German officer will be probably compared to Schindler, although his philanthropy does not quite share the same basis).This is also a wonderful tribute to Polish artists, through Chopin's music, with the concert at the very end of the film and the opening performance by the pianist at the local radio station (with the sound of bomb explosions in the background) forming an harmonious link between the beginning and end of the film (following Polanski's usual story-frame).Overall, The Pianist is one of the most detailed and shocking accounts of the treatment of the Jews by the Nazis, with the atmosphere in Warsaw well captured and believable. Quite possibly, The Pianist will remain in the history of film-making as the most touching and realistic portraits of the holocaust ever made.Polanski's film deserves a strong presence in the 2003 Oscar nominations, including a nomination for Adrien Brody's amazing performance, Polanski's sublime direction, best adapted screenplay and, obviously, best picture. This could be, at last, Polanski's long awaited, triumphal comeback to the high and mighty Hollywood.","

"Hitchcoc","10 September 2009","There have been so many fine films that deal with the Holocaust. Each shows the atrocities of the Germans, their random cruelty, their ruthlessness. This film has all that, but it also has Adrien Brody. This is a film that gets us inside the human being, the person who must run, whose iron will propels him forward. The thing is, though, he is not necessarily a hero in the traditional sense. We sense the fatigue of his character as he runs from situation to situation, just trying to stay alive. There are good people around him, many are good Germans. While we watch people shot in the head, beaten to the ground, mutilated, we see him moving aimlessly toward something (the thing is we don't know what that something is). He hears rumors about the Russians liberating Poland but he can't let up for a second. He watches as the underground makes sacrifice after sacrifice, their building burned, their people sent up in flames. He sees himself as a coward. He thinks about being dead, but his will to live drives him on. The title, of course, is him--the pianist--a nationally known classical pianist, suddenly dehumanized. We see his weaknesses and his strengths. We also get a more balanced though terrifying view of the situation in the Polish ghetto. This is a film we should all see.","

"Leofwine_draca","19 April 2017","THE PIANIST is a film that takes a dark and disturbing subject matter - the persecution of the Warsaw Jews by Nazis in the Second World War - and turns it into a spellbinding, enthralling journey of a movie. Roman Polanski could easily have made this maudlin and sentimental like Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST, but he thankfully avoids that temptation and the result is the much better movie of the two.This film contains a documentary-style realism in its depiction of the various atrocities carried out by the uncaring Germans. It gets dark and darker as it goes on, and yet the viewer is unable to tear his eyes off the screen because it's all so well-realised and realistic. Adrien Brody plays the eyes and ears of the viewer in a subdued manner, yet delivers his greatest and most believable performance as a result. The story has a lot of darkness and violence, but Polanski's expert camera-work and endless style stops the subject matter ever becoming depressing; instead there's enough tension to keep you involved and wanting to find out what's next. Things build to a suitably touching and poignant climax that doesn't disappoint.","

"ashcoounter","1 February 2003","Polanski has depicted the gory details of the holocaust without much restraint. But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.Every single act of escapade Szpilman goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.Overall, Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.Pawel Edelman's camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.Hervé de Luze's editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.The scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.Great film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars. I will give it a 9 Out of 10.","

"rmax304823","30 April 2008","Film makers have to step carefully when dealing with issues like the Nazi extermination program. There have been equally brutal programs of ethnic cleansing in places like Southeast Asia and Rwanda, in which hundreds of millions died, but nothing like this in Europe since the Middle Ages. The victims here were not only Jews but Gypsies, the mentally ill, homosexuals, socialists, communists, and political undesirables. The Nazis eliminated not six million but some uncountable number between 12 and 15 million. An event like that can't be treated lightly and milked for easy tears, or the event itself is cheapened.Fortunately, the films that have explored the subject have been uniformly well done, as Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is well done. Polanski himself suffered in much the same way as the protagonist, Vlad Szpilman (Adrien Brody). Polanski has a habit of embellishing his tales but there's no question that in this instance he knows what he's talking about.Szpilman is a well-known young pianist on Warsaw radio but the German occupation puts the station out of business. He and his family are herded into the Warsaw ghetto where they are subject to constant abuse and occasional murder. Szpilman barely escapes being sent to Treblinka with the rest of his family. And for the last half of the film, with the help of some friends who endanger themselves by lending him aid, he scuttles rat-like from one hiding place to another, each more dismal and perilous than the last. He suffers jaundice, his hair and beard grow long, his clothes turn to tatters, his food disappears, he's half frozen, and he seems to shrink.He's reduced to living in the attic of a nearly demolished apartment building and is ecstatic to discover a gallon can of pickles overlooked on the top shelf of a kitchen cabinet. The can falls out of his hands while he tries to open it and rolls across the floor to come to rest at the boots of a German officer, Captain Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann). The only Germans we've seen so far have been brutes -- ridiculing the insane, executing Jews who ask simple questions, or simply shooting people chosen at random.We expect nothing from Hosenfeld except a quick shooting. But Hosenfeld is a human being and, having discovered that Szpilman ""is"" -- or rather ""was"" -- a pianist, he asks him to play a piano left in one of the flats. Szpliman has been unable to play for years and when he seats himself we worry that he might not bring it off and, indeed, his first chords are tentative, uncertain. Then his playing becomes automated, the old habits return, and he dashes off a dramatic and exquisitely executed piece of Chopin. Hosenfeld has been leaning back, enjoying the music, then leaves Szpilman quietly to his attic. He returns a few times later, before the Germans withdraw before the Russians, and unceremoniously hands him a few packages of food and, finally, his overcoat. The matter-of-fact compassion shown by Hosenfeld, and Szpilman's desperate need for contact with another human, are very moving.When the Russian troops finally arrive, Szpilman stumbles out of his hovel to greet them, but seeing his overcoat the Russians open fire on him. Szpilman finally convinces them that he is a Pole, not a German, and one of the befuddled soldiers asks, ""Then why the ****ing coat?"" Szpilman is trembling with fear but manages to gulp, ""I was cold."" An epilogue tells us that Szpilman went on with his career and Hosenfeld wound up in a Soviet prison camp where he died in 1952, despite Szpilman's attempt to find him. Under the end credits, a smiling Szpilman plays a lively, sparkling composition by Chopin.It's a remarkable film. Polanski is no longer the Wunderkind but a mature film maker. Nothing is excessive. We need only as much as we need to know to understand Szpilman's travails -- one tragedy following another. There are no sentimental speeches at the final parting of Szpilman and his family. Szpilman himself never breaks down. He simply does what needs to be done to survive. And Adrien Brody captures what Szpilman must have been like. (From some angles he resembles the young Arthur Rubenstein.) Kretschmann gets Hosenfeld down pat as well. In their scenes together we sense their respective positions -- one man with nothing left to lose, the other with nothing left to gain. The story, and the historical facts it's based on, raise many questions about human nature, of course. I'm not at all sure that if we could find the answers to those questions we would like what we found.One of the better films of the year.","

"KineticSeoul","16 February 2011","This is a well crafted movie that deserves some praise, but I still felt the film is a bit overrated. I guess it's cause I was expecting a phenomenal and amazing movie, but what I got was a pretty good movie. It just wasn't as powerful or compelling as I thought it would be. Adrien Brody was almost perfect for this role, his transition from being a prideful musician to a broken down man was done really well. This film just wasn't all that challenging, the plot is basically based on a true story of Władysław Szpilman(Adrien Brody). And his struggle to survive during the Holocaust. The thing is the whole thing seems a bit conventional a lot of aspect of this movie just seemed to narrow at times and straightforward which isn't necessarily a good thing and lack depth. The film also seemed to drag a bit because of the direction it kept going, it's a good movie and I agree with some of the positive feedback this film has been getting. It just isn't a powerful or amazing film I was looking forward to seeing, not one of those movies I feel I need to see again someday after it's finished. It really isn't a masterpiece like come critics claim it to be.7.8/10","

"Xstal","28 October 2020","Around 30% of Warsaw's population was Jewish in 1939, about 375,000 people; with refugees, the population of the ghetto rose to 450,000 - over 80,000 perished in it; deportations to Treblinka began in July 1942 (Yad Vashem).I would rather have seen this film in the languages of those it portrays using actors from the countries and regions where these despicable, heinous and unforgivable events took place. It would have made an already immensely powerful reflection even more so.","

"orangeisthenewawesome","21 February 2011","My husband and I decided to watch this on netflix one night as we had heard it was good. Neither of us had any expectations and figured if it won a couple of Oscars it must be decent. I had no idea it was an absolute masterpiece. This may be one of the best movies I have seen to date. Days after I saw this movie I cannot stop visualizing the images and feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. The cinematography is breathtaking. The beauty of pre-devastation Warsaw is sharply contrasted with the bleakness of the ghetto, and it would be understatement to say how haunting the visuals of Warsaw after the bombings were. The acting here is tremendous. Brody (who I had really not seen in anything else significant prior to this) carries the entire movie on his wan shoulders. He conveys so much with pain, anguish, hope, and loss with just his eyes. It is quite the actor who causes the viewer to feel the pain he is experiencing as a character. This was an extremely well deserved acting Oscar.This movie is extremely depressing considering the subject matter but it is told and portrayed with grace and power by Polanski. So many scenes are powerful and haunting. To me, in many ways this is a perfect movie. Yes, I know this review is filled with hyperbole, but I simply cannot remember the last time I was so moved and impressed by a film as I was with the Pianist. See it at least once.","

You see the violence ramp up as the film progresses.It's an incredibly well made film, it looks terrific, people look very much of that time, surely a consideration the casting director used.Several things that always stayed with me, someone begging with a corpse laying on the ground that was one moment, another being the elderly man in the wheelchair, harrowing sequences.I thought Adrien Brody was excellent as Szpillman, a very understated performance, totally sincere, incredibly believable.

"zetes","6 July 2003","The Pianist is far from Roman Polanski's best film or his `most personal work,' as the back of the DVD case says. In fact, it's easily the least personal film I've seen from him; any director who has enough clout to secure the funding for the production could have made this film and had it turn out just as well. As a director, it is a small achievement. Likewise, the screenplay writes itself; in fact, it did write itself, as it's based on a true story. I must admit I have a bias against films dealing with WWII and especially the Jewish experience in Europe. Affecting the audience is as simple as snapping one's fingers. Or, more specifically, executing a Jew. Whenever the audience starts to get a little comfortable, all the filmmaker has to do is have a Nazi shoot a Jew in the head. It's all too easy. Any film with that subject matter is automatically deemed important in the minds of critics and audiences, which makes it difficult for anyone to propose any criticism against it. Truth be told, The Pianist is a very good film. It's well done, and, while I don't think it's Polanski's best work, he does a good job. But it's too easy, I think, to overpraise something like this. It was very entertaining that this movie caused so many upsets at the Oscars, but, after seeing the film, it doesn't surprise me. This is the kind of movie that impresses the Academy most, because it's easy. The three awards it won were not deserved, at least in my opinion. If I weren't so familiar with the Academy and their thought processes, it would really shock me that Polanski beat Scorsese, who made an original picture with verve and passion, and that Brody (I haven't mentioned him, and he is good) beat Daniel Day-Lewis, who, as I've just said above, creates a character that will live forever. As for the screenplay, Ronald Harwood (and/or Polanski) could have made the film much more than just one of ten thousand tales of survival. There are a lot of moments when more substance could have been found. I like how Szpilman has to constantly watch the action while locked up in a room, yearning to be able to do something about it, but always relegated to the spectator's role. They do do well when they introduce the character of the Nazi soldier trying to make good by helping Szpilman, but they don't do very much. Of course, I think part of the point is that this man appeared and disappeared without much pomp or circumstance. In fact, it would have been more powerful if they had never revealed that Szpilman discovered who this man was. Of course, that might have been disrespectful.I have now seen all five Best Picture nominees from last year, and I would rank them as follows: 1) The Hours; 2) Gangs of New York; 3) The Pianist; 4) Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers; 5) Chicago. That I rank the actual winner last shouldn't raise eyebrows, because, to tell you the truth, I don't rank The Pianist and The Two Towers that much higher. The first two were original, intelligent, and challenging. The last three were much simpler, and it's no big surprise that they are more beloved. 8/10.","

"dbdumonteil","29 December 2005","In March 2003, Roman Polanski's ""the Pianist"" (2002) pocketed three Oscars including best actor (Adrien Brody) and best director (Roman Polanski). One month earlier, the ceremony of the French Oscars showered the movie with praise by attributing to it and his author similar prizes. Earlier in May 2002, the festival of Cannes crowned it of the most prestigious prize: the deservedly Golden Palm. Already in 2002 and chiefly throughout 2003, awards rained on Polanski's deeply moving piece of work and rightly so. It is a true return to form for him after an uneven career which started after the spooky ""the Tenant"" (1976) and wildly oscillated between duds (Pirates, 1986, Frantic, 1988) and palatable but not peerless works (Death and the Maiden, 1994, the Ninth Gate, 1999). ""The Pianist"" helped to rekindle the flame that made such treasures, hallmarks in their own domains (the wonderful ""Rosemary's Baby"", 1968 in the fantastic or the fabulous ""Chinatown"", 1974 in the film noir) and could be a stalwart success in the movie with the Second World War as the backdrop. It is perhaps Polanski's most personal film to date and the one he has always wanted to shot, surely to exorcise traumatic memories haunting him since his childhood. Like his main protagonist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, he experienced the horror of the ghetto of Warsaw.To get his demons out of his head, he preferred to adapt for the screen Spilzman's memories, a genius pianist and a man who bit by bit lost his family and friends on whom he could rely, a man who was deprived of his piano and thus of his ""raison d'être"". As Stefan Zweig says: ""to read is to live"", well for him ""to play is to live"". Even when he has the opportunity to play, he has to refrain himself. See the scene in which he has settled down to his flat. Before leaving him, the owner says to him: ""please, don't make noise"". Polanski makes us share his craving for playing by putting his main protagonist in front of the sacred instrument ans plays us the music in Spilzman's head without the latter touches the keys. He was also a man who saw sorrow, pain and the unthinkable (the sequences in which German officers and soldiers kill Jewish people give goose pimples because they're precisely unthinkable). Throughout his sufferings, chance didn't totally relinquish him: he was rescued at the last minute by a Polish policeman (and a fellow of his brother) who stopped him from going up in the train of death to Auschwitz. At this moment, he was saved from death but he lost his family. Then, he had to rely on his courage to survive and enjoyed the help of some fellows even if they absconded (the woman Spilzman made the acquaintance at the beginning of the film and her husband who found him a flat). At last, the German officer at the end of the film, was his ultimate glimmer of hope.Roman Polanski shot his film with a classic but startling directing for the sake of detail and realism. It has a linear but inevitable progression which has the look of a downward spiral: the tightening of the restrictions on Jewish people which become increasingly harsher (the armband to distinguish the Jewish from other peoples, then the delimitation and the encircling of the ghetto, the Jews chased away from their neighborhood and deported to the extermination camps) and the least sign of certainty is nearly automatically blighted: ""we have work certificates at last"" sighs Spilzman's father. Alas! Hopes blighted since just as he pronounces these words, a German officer asks them with other people to go outside. Some of them are killed while the others (including Spilzman's family) have to wait on a large square with thousands of others. Polanski also relates notable events with a minimum of means (the fight and shooting sequences are often perceived from a balcony or a window).The second part of the film strongly recalls Polanski's murkiest hours extracted from his masterworks. For example, in his flat, Spilzman tries to be as quiet as possible and while searching for food in his kitchen and drops crockery. The noise makes his neighbor intervene and by giving the alarm in the building obliges him to flee once again. At this moment, we find one of Polanski's trademarks: the eerie neighbor who has a harmful influence on the hero and contributes to his or her fall (the Castevet in ""Rosemary's Baby"", the offbeat inhabitants of the building in ""the Tenant"". In another extent, when Spilzman has to lurk in the destroyed ghetto (the distant shot where we can see him trudging in the ruins of this apocalyptic landscape deserves to rank among Polanski's most notable shots in all his filmography), Polanski really places us amid a ""in camera"" in spite of the sprawling scenery.The filmmaker should also be thanked for having chosen Adrien Brody in the main role. He works wonders in a part which seemed to be tailor-made for him, a far cry from his cardboard character in M Night Shyamalan's ""the Village"" (2004). He can act several persona in himself: a smart young man as well as a dirty and bearded tramp. His angular face, his acute and melancholic countenance stay with us for a long time. As for the German officers, they are often caricatured but ultimately Polanski eschews the trap of Manicheism which seemed to pervade the whole film thanks to the last sequences with the sympathetic German officer. Not all Nazis were beasts...Interspersed with either unbearable, either excruciating or either moving sequences and with striking shots, ""the Pianist"" has its place on the podium of Polanski's towering achievements. See it any costs! Unfortunately it would seem that the flame began to flicker again given the lukewarm critics ""Oliver Twist"" met this year. The slump again? Only time will tell...","

"Shilo_R_A","18 March 2023","The Pianist must be one of the most acclaimed and well-known depictions of the Holocaust in cinema, ever. Directed by Roman Polanski, it follows the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman - a Jewish pianist in Warsaw, Poland, just as the Nazi occupation begins there. It depicts the worsening state of him and his family through the Holocaust, and his struggle to survive throughout it.I can appreciate the sentiment of the film, showing how even well-known artists and people with status were stripped by the Nazi regime of their human rights, how things slowly escalated until even the artists couldn't think of art outside of dreams, maybe. How it all came down to surviving, and even the luckiest people that somehow managed to survived were deeply scarred by the horrible things they've seen. I'd say that Brody gives a very solid performance, and the film does manage to accomplish what it tries to do, in a way. The problem is, well, that it doesn't do much beyond that.There were scenes with shock value, sure, and thinking that everything we saw in the film is pretty close to how things went down can make one shiver all right. But the plot, especially in the second half of the film, didn't have much meat at all. The film crawled its way forward, the saturation goes down with each scene, but never did anything special to compensate for the slow, slow pacing and lack of interest I had in the main plot. The cinematography is okay, the dialogue is okay, the performances are okay. The moments that moved me were mostly that - moments - and mostly on the first half of the film. For a 2.5-hour film, it could've done more. Especially considering how widely acclaimed it is.So, if I had to sum it up, I'd say that I do appreciate certain things in the movie - the way it depicts the fall, the terror and the utter shock that Jewish artists have felt as they were torn apart from their seemingly-safe world, for instance. The shock value is definitely there in certain scenes, but the overall experience was pretty slow and lacking. I wasn't immersed, and I think that the film ends up feeling just...well, not bad, but not really good either. The first half is pretty good; the second half is mostly meh. I'm feeling something like a 6.3/10. Really wanted to like this more, but I guess it wasn't meant to be.","

"ma-cortes","18 November 2008","This is an emotionally tale and very decent drama about a pianist named Szpilman from luxurious life until terrible ending in the Warsaw ghetto. Polanski correctly directs a spellbinding portrait about the holocaust with his personal knowledge and proper experience on his childhood . Adrien Brody is excellent in a complicate and suffering role. Besides splendid actors, Frank Finlay,Jessica Meyer, Emilia Fox and Thomas Kretschman as a good Nazi officer who helps him. Evocative cinematography by cameraman Pawel Edlman, Polanski's usual. Musical score by Wojciech Kilar with brilliant piano sounds. Academy Award for best director Roman Polanski, Actor, Adrien Brody and adapted script by Ronald Harwood based on Wladyslaw Szpilman memories.Adding more details over largely described on the movie referred 'the Warsaw ghetto uprising', the events happened on the following manner : In 1939, after the invasion of Poland, Reinhard Heydrich chief of Gestapo began to place all Polish Jews in ghettos, where they could slowly die of hunger and disease. The campaign was to be administered by the Waffen-SS the party's military formations that fought as integral units in the armed forces. The Warsaw ghetto was the largest of these segregated areas established by the Nazis in Poland. In 1940 Heydrich, using the excuse that the spread of typhus had to be contained, set up a special section 11 miles in circumference enclosed by a brick wall 10 feet high. The cost was paid by the Judenrat, the Jewish Council of twenty-four-members, which was in charge of Jewish affairs inside the ghetto. In 1940 more than 80.000 gentile Poles living in the infected area were ordered to leave, and the next month about 140,000 living elsewhere in the city were moved in which the 240,000 still live in the ghetto. Some 360.000 Jews, a third of Warsaw's population, were herded into a 3,5-square-mile area. Meanwhile, Gestapo agents removed all Jews from the economic and cultural life of the city, from factories,shops, theaters, and libraries. On November 15,1940, the ghetto was sealed and its twenty-two entrances closed. No one was allowed to leave or enter, there was to be contact with the outside world.The situation soon became critical,Jews fought for jobs in the ghetto, including work with the labor battalions organized by the Nazis. Those unable to find work tried to exist by selling jewels,clothing, or anything else to obtain food. From 300 to 400 died daily in the Warsaw trap. More than 43.000 starved to death during the first year. Children crazed by hunger crawled through the sewers to the non-Jewish sectors of the city to smuggle in a bit of food. People were no longer moved by the sight of men and women falling dead on the streets. The Nazi authorities began intensified measure on July 22, 1942. As a memorial to Heydrich, Heirich Himmler ordered all Jews except those already in concentration camps to be deported .The ghetto and all labor camps would then be destroyed. Mass deportations to the gas chambers of Treblinka began. In two months 300.000 Jews were eliminated. The Judenrat was ordered to deliver 6.000 Jews daily for deportation. Each day thousands were driven by guards through the gates.Young Zionists, pioneers training to go to Palestine, mobilized first to be followed by members of the Polish workers party . On July 28, 1942, the Jewish Combat organization consisting about 1.000 men and boys was formed. All resolved to kill as many of their tormentors as they could before they died.The Jews fighting from rooftops, cellars, and attics,Poles outside the ghetto now began to send in more revolvers, grenades, and dynamite. In 1943 the guerrillas divided into twenty-two groups built an intricate network underground cellars and tunnels ,linked with command posts . In April 19,1943 German troops moved in on the ghetto to send all who were left to Treblinka in a final action. First came the armed trucks, tanks, and armored cars. The ghetto fighters poured a hail of bullets, grenades and bombs, the fighting went on for twenty-eight days. The guerrillas fought to the last. Many committed suicide at the moment before capture. The Germans dragged survivors from the cellars and rubble. Fewer than 100 escaped, the last 60000 Jews had been exterminated or killed in the explosions and fires.Polish sources reported that the fighters had killed 300 Germans and wounded 1000. From Warsaw Jewish resistance moved to swamps and forests.","

"Buddy-51","14 June 2003","`The Pianist' is a bit like `Schindler's List' as seen from the inside out.  The one flaw in that earlier film always seemed to be that, by choosing to make a Gentile  Oskar Schindler - the protagonist in his film, Spielberg turned the Jews themselves almost into background players in their own story.  That doesn't happen with `The Pianist' since the hero in this case happens to be himself a Jew  the real life Polish pianist and composer Wladyslaw Szpilman - who managed, through strength, determination and the assistance of a number of brave and caring individuals, to survive the horrors of that darkest and most inexplicable chapter in 20th Century history.This is not to say that `The Pianist' is a better film than `Schindler's List'  far from it.  For while this latest work from Roman Polanski is a fascinating tale of survival in its own right, the film lacks the moral and psychological resonance that made Spielberg's work such a universally acclaimed masterpiece.  Because Schindler was an outsider looking in, he was forced to make the kind of moral choices that Szpilman never really faces in the situations in which he finds himself.  In fact, the one time that the protagonist is confronted with such an option  having to decide whether or not to betray his people by joining the Jewish police whose job it is maintain order in the Warsaw ghetto  Szpilman flat out declines the offer. This may, indeed, be the way circumstances played themselves out in real life, but this elimination of any kind of psychological depth makes `The Pianist' seem frustratingly superficial at times.Although the film isn't as rich and powerful as it might have been, `The Pianist' is still exceptional on a lot of different levels.  First of all, Polanski and his screenwriter, Ronald Hardwood, both of whom won Oscars for their work here, capture the brutality and sadism of the Nazi regime with frightening candor and almost `reportorial' objectivity.  As in `Schindler's List,' people in this film die in very believable, very graphic ways. Particularly interesting are the early sections of the film in which we witness the gradual steps leading up to the eventual deportation and extermination of the Warsaw Jews, beginning with the curtailment of Jewish civil rights, then to the branding of them with stars of David on their clothing, then to their imprisonment in the Warsaw ghetto, and, finally, to the inexorable walk to the gas chamber.  `The Pianist' doesn't take us that far on screen, but we sure sense the presence of those death camps in the loss of Szpilman's entire family.  `The Pianist' brilliantly recreates this shameful era in recent human history and does so without becoming sentimental and pretentious in the process.  Adrian Brody won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance here, and he is very good indeed, especially given the fact that the role calls for him to be more of a reactor to the events around him than a catalyst.  Polanski and Hardwood have provided this fine young actor with a veritable tour de force assignment that he executes with a great deal of skill and aplomb. Unfortunately, a number of the other characters - particularly those who go out of their way to help him - remain stubbornly enigmatic throughout.`The Pianist' is an honorable addition to the list of fine films that have attempted to come to grips with the subject of the holocaust.  But, for my money, the best still remains `The Shop on Main Street,' the Oscar-winning Best Foreign Language film of 1965.  This superb Czech film does what `The Pianist' is never quite able to do, which is to find a way to involve us in the momentous moral dilemmas that undoubtedly faced many of the people involved in this life-and-death event.  `The Pianist,' by making its tale strictly a story of survival and not a study of human psychology, fails to illuminate much of what we really need to know about that time. And about ourselves.","

"sddavis63","4 November 2009","The first thing that should be said is that this is most definitely more than a Holocaust movie. Although that dreadful event stands firmly in the background, this movie is really about one man's struggle for survival. The one man is Polish Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Adrien Brody played that lead role, and he played it well. Szpilman comes across as both pitiful in his desperation to survive but at the same time as noble in his desperation to survive. Brody portrays him as a man with great dignity. It was a challenging role, because as the movie progresses, there's less and less dialogue for the simple reason that almost everyone except Szpilman has been taken by the Nazis. Brody ends up playing long stretches without voice, but it doesn't stop him from rendering a brilliant portrait of the man, whose friends and family are gone and who simply tries to live day by day hoping for a way out of this madness. Just as haunting are extended scenes in which director Roman Polanski simply shows us a devastated Warsaw - not just the Jewish ghetto, but other parts of the city as well. The scenes of rubble, the scenes of innocent people being gunned down in the street by German soldiers - sometimes just for sport, without any other obvious reason, the scenes of burned out buildings. It's all haunting.For all that - and all that was very good - there was something about the story that didn't really click with me. For some strange reason I found it difficult to follow and I did think that at almost two and a half hours it was a little bit too long. As much as was accomplished in that running time could have been accomplished in two hours flat. It's a good movie, but just failed to reach the level of greatness that some have assigned to it. 6/10","

"johnharapa","23 October 2021","Some reviews I've read here, have found this movie too detached, lacking urgency. I believe, that impassive quality reflects exactly what Polanski wants to say this extraordinary jewel.By showing Wladyslaw Szpilman as a survivor but not a fighter or a hero--as a man who does all he can to save himself, but would have died without enormous good luck and some kindness from a few non-Jews--Polanski is reflecting, I believe, his own deepest feelings: that he survived, but need not have, and that his mother died and left a wound that had never properly healed.Adrian Brody's performance was utterly mesmerising. I doubt that we'll see him act like that - EVER.Little wonder he was awarded Best Male Actor at the Oscars.Polanski too was awarded Best Director - ironic Brody was the youngest recipient of an Oscar and Polanski was the oldest until Clint Eastwood won it several years later.","

"ACollegeStudent","17 May 2023","Rating: 7.0The movie was ok, it put you in the shoes of a Jewish pianist surviving the German occupation. Honestly, it's boring in stretches since we already know the pianist survives therefore it has no stakes. Due to this and a subject matter has been done to death it personally didn't move me. The side characters weren't compelling or interesting, and the pianist himself is just a guy on the run who can play the piano, no other notable traits besides that. Because the subject matter is overdone and we already know how it ends it needs a lot more to keep it engaging which this doesn't have. Granted this is a biography so can't deviate too much or else it loses accuracy.","

"Derek237","30 March 2003","The Pianist is not a movie made for entertainment. It's either more or less than that and only the viewer can decide. You have to ask yourself sometimes if the main reason films about the holocaust are so popular is because of shock appeal. If a movie depicts these terrifying events well, does that make it a good movie? The Pianist has many scenes showing the Nazi's brutality that feel almost voyeuristic. Some scenes show Adrien Brody's character looking out the window at these terrible things and you feel as if you're looking out a window, too.I hope shock appeal isn't the reason this film is liked so much, though. Because this is an amazing story about the will to survive. Music is the character's passion,and throughout his struggles he can only fantasize about playing piano. There is one scene near the end in which he finally gets the opportunity. What follows is a touching moment that transitions from rusty skills warming up to an intense and passionate display of artistic talent. In this moment there is no longer a war going on, no longer the agony of hunger or memories of lost loved ones, just beautiful music. His reputation as a musician and his desire to go on to play again is essentially what keeps him alive. And who says art isn't important?Adrien Brody is very good in this. Well obviously he is, he just won the Best Actor Oscar. I think he can be compared to Tom Hanks in Cast Away- even in scenes of silence there's just something about the actor's movements and expressions that keeps you engaged.There's another scene near the end that defines the entire performance, the entire movie for me: After all the trouble Brody went through trying to survive, he is almost killed by the people who would save him. He is wearing a coat that a German officer had given him earlier, and when Russian troops spotted Brody they thought he was German. They shot at him and almost killed him, but they finally found out he was Polish. An officer asks him, ""Why the f-cking coat?"" Brody, with his hands still in the air, a terrified look on his face, almost crying, replies: ""I'm cold."" That did it for me.The Pianist is certainly a shocking and even depressing film, but like most movies that aspire to provoke thoughts and emotions, the audience takes out of it what they bring in to it. Surely Szpiellman wasn't just a lucky bastard who survived in times of inhumane brutality. It was through the kindness and compassion of others who helped him, if only because they found themselves inexplicably moved by his music.My rating: 10/10","

"evanston_dad","4 August 2010","Before seeing ""The Pianist,"" I thought there couldn't possibly be a movie about the Holocaust that could tell me something I didn't already know, or make me feel an emotion I haven't already felt a hundred times before about the topic. But director Roman Polanski proved me wrong.There's a scene in ""The Pianist"" in which Nazis invade a Jewish apartment building and ""clean out"" its tenants. They pick up an elderly man confined to a wheelchair, carry the chair to the edge of the balcony, and casually tip him over the edge to fall to his death on the pavement below. The moment shocked me in a way that nothing in Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" did, I think precisely because, unlike Spielberg, Polanski isn't interested in manipulating his audience into feeling something. The strength of his movies has always been that they unfold with a detached, objective point of view and let audiences draw their own conclusions. The scene described above is so shocking because Polanski does nothing to embellish it and therefore never draws attention to the fact that you're watching a movie.The rest of the film is like that -- it's harrowing and unpleasant at times, but it also rewards the viewer by saying something about a historical event when I didn't think there was anything left to say.Grade: A","

"tedg","21 April 2003","Spoilers herein.Nearly any film is for me a double experience: the watching and the post-coital rumination. That second phase can make the experience worthwhile even when the film itself is ordinary or poorly done.But it works the other way as well, especially when a film is designed for discussion: the film delivered with so many opinions that themselves are ordinary or poorly done. This film comes so charged. Szpilman wasn't `Jewish enough' to be the center of an important holocaust film, goes the most ordinary and loudest of them. I suppose there are some things about the commingling of descriptive art and definitive life to be said there. But one likes to have more freedom in post-film thoughts and that whole topic is dominated by the sorts of reflexive responses manipulated by film.There's a second prepackaged topic concerning whether `Schindler' was better or `worse.' I don't consider Spielberg's film a holocaust film at all: he lives in a happy world, where justice and right (and lots of other happy values) always triumph. His observations are always external. His goal is always to tell a story, a stance that furthers the distance between his films and reality. Polanski's project has no story at all, merely a life of accidents. His camera is within the artist's personal space. His own mannerisms are Eastern European and depressed, congruent with what he shows. (Speilberg's Schindler really did have the silk unctuousness of the East, but as observed from California.) So I credit Polanski's vision as having more historical credibility than Speilberg's, knowing that despite the best efforts of us all to avoid having practical history made by the movie marketplace.(One exception, where Polanksi is offensively theatrical: when Szpliman runs from the destroyed hospital, he faces a street of desolation as far as one can see, `High Noon'-wise.)Much more interesting to my mind is the portrayal of an artist. Polanski has always been deeply self-referential in his work: always there is an examination of the artist within the art. And I make a minor hobby out of collecting film experiences that do this with music and mathematics because I have some personal experience to work with. For those who don't know: Polands pride is Chopin, who invented a relationship to the piano that not only defined modernity but reinvented everything about musical performance. (Film would follow this lead in 1941.) Chopin built pieces designed to be bent in performance, designed with empty rooms that a pianist could explore. Unlike, Bach for instance, where the magic of the performance was in attuning to Bach and his intent, the performer of Chopin really could bring his own soul to parity with God. Szpliman was a strong pianist, and therefore more than a national character, instead a reflection of the Polish heart.Here, we  watch this man compromise his own pride, eschew his religion, run away from every opportunity for dignity in order to keep his hands warm to play another day; and not just play, but play on the radio for Poles. So during this painful journey, we assume what we are meant to in films about tortured artists: that the pain we are watching will be transmuted by this man into great art that will lift us all. His own personal denigration - what is done to him and the denigrating choices he makes - are worth it overall.This is where the fatal pessimism of Polanski stops, because he doesn't let us know the musical truth. This is not Szpilmans playing of course, but not much unlike him. Szpilman was a `safe' player, one who never had the strength or desire to add much to Chopin. That's why he was on the radio: his `interpretations' were unchallenging and palatable. But he would never have been considered an artist of note at all if he had not survived the perfect brutality of the Germans, whose own music, though sentimental was constrained in ways that Chopin's never was. The payoff is supposed to be that after his trials, the artist is now - theoretically - capable of expressing the pain and yearning of the world. That we are meant to so think is clear from the end, where he plays with the glow of Dreyfuss from `Music of the Heart.'Ah, but not so. The sound we actually hear throughout is by Olejniczak, a similarly ordinary man. Szpilman did not in fact come through a better artist, but much worse: a meek pianist. `Shellshocked,' postwar contemporaries would say. Contrast this with Artur Rubinstein. Jewish Pole of the previous generation, and the first giant to explore Chopin's rubato. He had his own dark nights, but not because the world was inhospitable. Listen to his recordings (freely available) compared to Szpilmans (hard to get) or even Olejniczaks on the soundtrack. These are two different universes. One is merely pleasant, the other life-altering.Polanski has made some great films (including the under-appreciated `Ninth Gate'), and his thinking through of the intellectual reach of a project is extensive but he has ultimately let us down here. Implicit in much of modern Jewishness is the triumph of enrichment of the people through their tribulation. Perhaps that is true, but this film undermines the idea when selecting Szpilman as metaphor.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.","

I'm not sure if it's because it evokes emotions or what, but this film, ""Schindler's List"" and others quickly rise to the top of the list of good films...

The grizzly reality feeling of the movie shell-shocked me in the first place but later on I recognized the pure feeling of the film: The horror what war does with innocent people truly is. the main story isn't about a war hero, but about people who don't want to die in this madness. Every aspect of the film is really done for an reason and in his place and you don't feel this as entertainment.the music is what hit me the most. the classical tunes had such an enormous impact on me and portrayed the feelings of the main role of the pianist. The fact that there are no hero's in a war movie is for me more than a welcome benefit. No war in the world should have hero's who can't die. Everybody in this movie can die, every second of it. The scary moments are real scary.
bottom line: ten times as realistic as the also brilliant Schindler's list. and twenty times better than Saving private Ryan for the lack of hero's and there is no patriotism at all.ten out of ten, best movie of 2002","

"Poseidon-3","19 January 2004","Far from the first motion picture to deal with the Holocaust and unlikely to be the last, this is nevertheless a stunning piece of film.  Brody portrays the title character (based on an actual person) who plays piano on Polish radio until the Nazi invasion of his country makes it impossible to continue.  Through his eyes, the audience witnesses the continual, seemingly-unstoppable dehumanization of Brody and his family and the virtual destruction of Poland.  The journey that this character takes, undoubtedly enhanced by director Polanski's own recollection of his early life, is almost incomprehensible.  Since so many films have been released on this subject, one can't help noticing the similarity to other movies and the familiarity of the situations depicted in the opening scenes.  However, the utter craftsmanship of this film and the casting (nothing short of perfection down the very last role) set this apart until the story's uniqueness kicks in.  Brody is nothing short of magnificent.  His face reflects (naturally and without mugging) the soulfulness, humiliation and deprivation of his character.  Polanski does a superb job of recreating the world of WWII Poland.  Every detail of the film is exact and mesmerizing (helped greatly by casting non-name actors who inhabit their roles with great feeling and authenticity.  There is no opportunity to play ""spot the star"" except for the most seasoned filmgoer.)  What happens to Brody is so startlingly, stunningly jaw-dropping it seems surreal at times.  Amazingly, Polanski is able to occasionally inject the faintest touches of black humor and irony to this, which makes for some very intriguing viewing.  That is not to say that the film is easy to watch.  Already a master (for decades) of creating feelings of unease, paranoia and fear in the viewer, Polanski sets into motion a film in which the audience can hardly breathe for fear that their own noise will result in the discovery of the frequently hidden Brody.  The film is notable for making sounds such as marching boots, idling cars and faraway voices seem more terrifying than anything Hollywood has ever had to offer in all of its multitudinous thrillers and horror films. If there are any faults in the film, they are few.  Perhaps some of Brody's experiences seem repetitive at times and the depiction of Germans sometimes approaches caricature.  However, all is forgiven as the story reaches its heart-stopping moment when Brody is attempting to open an all-important can of food.  Here the film reaches brilliance.  Clearly, the film is not going to appeal to the shallow or the disinterested, but to those who have a fondness for striking, deeply-felt and lovingly-told stories, this one is hard to top.","

The sense of disgust is real. How awful. How awful.I could not help identifying myself with the Jewish Poles in Varsovia. I couldn't help thinking that the paralytic old man thrown down the window could be my grandfather. Couldn't help thinking that the kid savagely pulled through the wall could be my brother. Couldn't help thinking that the girl asking the SS-guard the wrong question and being killed just for that, could be myself.The film describes beastly destruction of any dignity, and yet the struggle for surviving despite everything, even if rationally you realise that, perhaps, it would be even better to end it all at once. It describes the dishonesty of people profiting of this situation to make business out of your misery. It describes your need of believing the words of men NOT of their word, if they promise you life. And affection and courage surviving despite all this.This film could make a good pair with ""der Untergang"" with Bruno Ganz, which is also such a masterpiece that you may risk feeling sympathetic with the Nazi.

"Theo Robertson","20 September 2009","The problem with making a holocaust film is that it's a subject that's been done before . Everyone from Steven Spielberg to ( Amazingly and somewhat hypocritically I say ) Vanessa Redgrave has made a film centering around the Nazi attempt to exterminate European Jewry . I have a problem with this because it denigrates history to an extent . If people have to make a film featuring man's inhumanity to man as a reminder what does this say for the rest of humanity ? Can't the rest of humanity watch a documentary like SHOA or the Genocide episode of THE WORLD AT WAR ( My first introduction to The Holocaust ) or read a book of the accounts of Nazi mass murder ? Would it be too cynical to point out how well rewarded Holocaust movies are ? It's also noticeable how formulaic these type of movies are . We start at the beginning of the war and follow the protagonist's survival until they're liberated by the allies in 1945 That said THE PIANIST does have merits of its own even though it doesn't really bring much to the table originality wise . Actually the food allegory is appropriate though slightly confusing . Early in the film we see the terrible conditions in the Warsaw ghetto as its Jewish population are effectively walled up from the rest of the city and left to die . Cut to a restaurant interior as Wladyslaw Szpilman entertains the guests by playing the piano as the patrons grow fat by gorging themselves on food , fine wine and cigarettes as their fellow Jews fall dead in the streets . With a little editing you might find yourself thinking this part was directed by David Irving instead of Roman Polanski ! One thing THE PIANIST does do well is include the apocryphal tale of the Jews discussing their fate at the hands of the Nazis with no one wanting to believe for a second that the lone voice stating the Nazis are deporting them to be murdered may in fact be talking the truth no matter how unbelievable and horrific the truth may be Like I AM LEGEND the story suffers from the fact that the protagonist has no one to speak to for large portions of the narrative but there's so much incident on screen such as the Warsaw uprising it's not a major problem . You could make the point that Szpliman then becomes a spectator to Polish history rather than a character in his own right and you'd possibly be correct but these scenes are very well choreographed and filmed that it shouldn't be made as a criticism . There's also the introduction of "" A good German "" that we've seen before in films such as MUTTER'S COURAGE but Hosenfeld is so well drawn and acted by Thomas Kretschmann it's very difficult not to feel sorry for his fate In truth THE PIANIST follows the usual structure of holocaust movies but unlike some movies of this particular genre certainly deserved much of the critical acclaim hoisted upon it . As can be expected it's not a feel good movie but is definitely a well made and acted story of human suffering and endurance","

"Doylenf","11 June 2003","Words are inadequate to describe the flawless flow of events in this absorbing account of Polish Jews facing extinction in the Warsaw Ghetto of the '40s during the Nazi reign of terror.Surely the most deserving Oscar award in years was bestowed on Adrien Brody who captures his character completely and carries the film with his amazingly real performance. He is at the center of vision throughout most of the action--so perfect in his role that he makes the story an unforgettable experience. His confrontation with a Nazi officer who discovers his hiding place and then asks him to prove that he is a pianist by playing the piano, is just one of the memorable highlights. This scene alone was justification for Brody's Oscar.Roman Polanski's direction is masterful throughout, never allowing the story to bog down in sentimentality but keeping the focus on survival and some of the horrific things that happen along the way.An inspired piece of filmmaking that is stunning to watch because it is so real and moving. Not since SCHINDLER'S LIST has the brutality and epic sweep of World War II been captured so accurately.","

And I don't even mean that negatively.I've watched Spielberg's film several times and know too well how painful Holocaust movies are, and while ""Life is Beautiful"" was a tragicomic fable and ""Sophie's Choice"" more of a character study relating a traumatic experience, I knew ""The Pianist"" would be on the same level of ambition and seriousness than Spielberg's film, if only because it was directed by Roman Polanski, a Holocaust survivor himself. I knew the movie would feature shocking arbitrary executions and poignant separations, so in a way, ""The Pianist"" was already having an impact on me without watching it. But this is not the only reason why I didn't feel the urge to watch it.Part of the blame is to be put on the film itself although it was inevitably going to be compared with its 'glorious' predecessor. Speaking of my own experience, I was mislead by ""The Pianist"" and the movie trailers. I thought it was the story of a man who played music for the Nazis and his survival, and therefore found in the present's horror and gloominess a heaven of escapism in the inner, universal and timeless beauty of music. Wladislaw would have the state of mind of one of Schindler's factory workers with music as the same weapon as Guido's humor and optimism in ""Life is Beautiful"". Of course, I realize now how my preconceived ideas totally underestimated Roman Polanski and I hope this review redeems my 10 years of abstinence.First, one must give to Spielberg what is Spielberg's and to Polanski what is Polanski's. ""Schindler's List"" is a better directed film but ""The Pianist"" is a better told story. And while the directing of Spielberg betrays sometimes the harshness of its subject by too much 'mise en scene', Polanski's ability to hook our hearts to the fate of Wladislaw Spillman, magnificently portrayed by Adrien Brody, and his family is beyond words. Indeed, we feel like part of this family. While the epic scope of ""Schindler's List"" provided a sort of moral aura to the victims, making the film a martyrdom's remembrance, ""The Pianist"" is simply the chronicles of a banal horror. And Polanski keeps an intimate, almost unnoticeable directing, to better convey the feeling that we're watching normal people whose lives are dramatically affected by an absurd War, and it's their very normality that emphasizes the cruelty of the Nazi treatment.The film opens in Warsaw in September 1939 so those with a minimum of historical knowledge understand the implication. Wladislaw is playing Chopin in a studio when the first German bombings are heard, his family wants to leave but later, they learn in the radio that France and Britain entered the War. Relieved, they celebrate the news with a toast, and the relatively cheerful ambiance contrasts with the usual demonstrations of grief and pain. Of course, we know the worst is to come, but Polanski takes his time to get us immersed in the war's ambiance and letting us observe the progressive decline of the Spillmans, directly mirroring the atmosphere that probably prevailed within all the Jewish families.Through the Spillman's perspectives, we get a more accurate idea of the nightmare endured by Polish Jews. When they're all parked in the Warsaw ghetto, before the inevitable evacuation, we witness gut-wrenching, intolerable, and acts of brutality, so unbelievably gratuitous and horrific, we never doubt that they're based on true stories, and that war, definitely, inspires the worst from humanity. In war, there's no room for dignity, for charity, for understanding, for God I would even say. As for violence, there is no scale, soldiers throwing off a balcony an old grandfather on a wheelchair because he couldn't stand is a horrifying sight, but maybe I expected these kind of moments so much that I was more shocked by the part where the soldiers made people dance together. Sometimes, humiliations are more impacting than random and arbitrary killings.And again, the talent of Polanski is precisely not to have overplayed on the directing department: no 'Black and White', no special effects, no 'little girl in Red', just basic colors, as to sustain the feeling of a present, more real then more horrific. ""Schindler's List"" might be a better film for some, but it's still a film, while ""The Pianist"" is a survival story, raw and real. Not a hero, not a victim either, the main protagonist will sometimes count on his courage, sometimes on his good luck, sometimes on the help of good-hearted and understanding people, from any sides. There is a light of hope in the film, through music, at a time where humanity reached its lowest point, music was here to remind people, to remind Nazis what a waste the War was, a feeling incarnated by Adrien Brody's sad-looking eyes.Again, don't expect a hero à la Oskar Schindler in Wladislaw, ""The Pianist"" shows the boldness of a period where cowardice was sometimes guided by survival instinct, where the desire to live could be more necessary than the desire to fight, because surviving left more voices to speak about the atrocities. ""The Pianist"" reveals those hidden subtleties that couldn't be truly expressed in epic movies. Some Jews didn't fight back precisely because the horrors of Auschwitz, Treblinka, Buchenwald had to be known, and ironically, this was one of the reasons that accelerated the exterminations' process. And some like Wladislaw had to hide not to make the sacrifices of the others unnecessary, those were tough times and no one is allowed to put a judgment... not us, anyway.And this is why ""The Pianist"" is more affecting than ""Schindler's List"", and if one has any doubt, let's not forget, that Spielberg was born in 1946 while Roman Polanski is still a war survivor who lost his mother in a Death Camp.","

"Steffi_P","5 April 2012","The Pianist is a movie that often gets bundled together with Schindler's List as being ""about"" the holocaust. But this is a misunderstanding, a simplification even, of this picture (and of Schindler's List). It relates to the holocaust, but it is not the story of the holocaust – it's the story of one man. Władisław Szpilman was an artist, with great talent in his hands and his mind, and in him is represented something very precious in humanity. He also appears, as many such people really are, someone to whom the music mattered far more than current affairs. As such, he provides a unusual view on atrocity, that of someone who, rather than actively fight against it, for the most part tried simply to exist in spite of it.This somewhat passive yet dignified stance is ably reflected in Roman Polanski's direction, which has always been characterised by an excruciating intimacy with his subjects and a certain detachment from the world in which they inhabit. Here we see Szpilman glimpsing the war through windows and doorways, yet often himself or his hands in close-up. But Polanski's boldest strokes of genius are in his creation and presentation of the ghetto and its inhabitants, especially as regards how he draws our attention. The soldiers giving a cigarette to an elderly Jewish man and the couple fighting over a can of stew are foregrounded. Seconds later, a corpse lies innocuously in the background. When Władek's father is accosted by two Germans, we see a couple of Polish women hastily get out of the way. When the shot changes to reveal the officer's back, the focus is suddenly on his gun holster – it draws our attention to things that give a little extra breadth and context to a scene.Central to The Pianist is Adrien Brody's portrayal of the title character. It's an incredibly sedate performance, with everything below the surface, utterly commanding of our attention despite its understatement. His emotions seem muted – when reunited with a friend the merest ghost of a smile plays across his lips, but by now we know the character and understand that this is a deep and sincere expression. Brody virtually carries the movie alone, and one of the unfortunate things about The Pianist is that not one other performance stands out at all, and the inadequacy of some of the supporting players does hurt the earlier scenes a little.But perhaps the greatest thing about The Pianist is in the fine construction of its story. Although most of it is based incredibly faithfully on Szpilman's own memoir, the adaptation by Ronald Harwood gives it a certain dramatic course. There is one intensely poignant scene, and one of the few entirely fictionalised episodes, in which Szpilman is being sheltered by Dorota, wakes to the sound of her cello-playing and, just for a moment, he can imagine what life would be like if she had been his wife. Finally, the scene where Hosenfeld asks Szpilman to play for him seems to be the key to the whole thing. It's as if every moment, every narrative line, points towards that scene. We've seen Germans forcing Jews to dance for their entertainment, which makes us first question Hosenfeld's motives. We've seen Szpilman's desperation to be reunited with a piano, his fingers making keystrokes in the air. In retrospect, this all seems a set-up for that encounter. In effect, The Pianist becomes a tale of a harrowing time, filtered through the beauty of a musical performance.","

"dbborroughs","7 August 2005","I don't know what to say about this move other than it really didn't movie me. Sure Adrian Brody is excellent as the Pianist of the title who hides out in Warsaw as the city is destroyed around him, but I never really connected to the story. I never really cared. I'm not sure if its poor film making or simply the fact that for me this seemed as been there and done that. Many of the things that I dislike in the well financed movies concerning the Holocaust came into play, in particular the fact that everything looks so nice as to be unreal. I also have the sense that the film is insisting that I like and respect it simply because of the subject matter. Its not that simple you have to give me characters and a good story before I care. Unfortunately while Brody is an excellent actor however I never connected to him. I never had a reason to care other than what happened was truly remarkable, which means this movie meant nothing to me. This film is a major disappointment","

"MattHankinson","21 December 2023","Me and my girlfriend are going to krakow over the weekend, and obviously a trip to auschwitz is on the cards. Having already seen the film once I wanted to watch again so I felt like I was in a much better head space for the trip.Adrien Brody is a great fit for this part. And his lack of speech in the whole films shows just how horrifying the actions of the Germans to the Jewish community were.We are fully on this journey with him, and it's heartbreaking the journey he goes on, especially having to leave his family to go to their death on the train to treblinka.The scene where the German SS throw the wheelchair bound man out the window always sticks with me.I can't believe he went through all that to nearly get killed by his own men mistaking him for a German!It's a shame Szpilman wasn't able to repay Hosenfeld his kindness, but maybe that is karma after all!","

"tfrizzell","11 April 2003","Haunting adaptation based on the life of Polish Jew Wladyslaw Szpilman (portrayed by surprise Oscar-winner Adrien Brody), a somewhat sheltered young man who just takes life as it comes to him and of course has an uncanny knack for playing the piano. Timing is bad though for the titled character as the Nazi occupation of Poland is imminent and exile to death camps is a definite possibility. Brody and his family (parents Maureen Lipman and Frank Finley and siblings Ed Stoppard, Jessica Kate Meyer and Julia Rayner) quickly realize that things are going from bad to worse as life starts to spin out of control. Instructions in the newspaper foreshadow future hardships as the Star of David patches are demanded of all Jewish peoples to wear and then the dreaded ghettos follow. The film then becomes heart-wrenching, but a change occurs that allows Brody to be spared from the death camps. Now he must try to avoid the Nazi Regime and find an unbending will to survive against all odds. Help does come from fellow Jews and non-Nazi Germans. Emilia Fox makes a lasting impression as a woman that Brody falls in love with early on and then shows up again later in an important part. Thomas Kretschmann also stands out as a Nazi officer who has a change of heart during the film's latter moments (he is also linked to Brody because of his love for the piano). ""The Pianist"" is a film that fashions itself after Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". This production is better in spots than the earlier movie, but as a whole it is not quite as impressive. ""The Pianist"" has a more exact focus and ends up being more of a one-man showcase for Brody in its second half. ""Cast Away"" meets the Holocaust would probably be the way to describe ""The Pianist"" when all is said and done. A brilliant adapted screenplay by Oscar-winner Ronald Harwood brings the novel to life. Roman Polanski finally struck Oscar gold for his unbelievable direction here (his work is on par with Scorsese's in ""Gangs of New York"" for the most part). He quietly became the oldest winner ever in the Academy's history in that particular category. All the supporters have well-calculated parts, but Brody's character is the most dominant of course. However, Brody never does reach the level of Liam Neeson in ""Schindler's List"" or even past Oscar-winner Roberto Benigni in ""Life Is Beautiful"". In fact his character is not near as complicated as the film would like. He is trying to survive and his motivation is life. A case can be made quite easily for either Daniel Day-Lewis in ""Gangs of New York"" or Jack Nicholson in ""About Schmidt"" to have taken home the Best Actor Oscar instead, but that is in the past now (it is better not to go into Brody's acceptance speech at all). Also Brody did very little playing of the piano himself (he had a double for the much more difficult pieces) which pales him to past Oscar winners like Holly Hunter (""The Piano"") and Geoffrey Rush (""Shine""). Overall I do think ""The Pianist"" is an excellent film. I do think it is one of the stronger screenplay- and direction-driven films of recent memory. Polanski ends up being the real star here and it is his vision, tone, ability and film-making skill that does make ""The Pianist"" one of the best movies of 2002. 5 stars out of 5.","

"CinemaClown","1 May 2011","Helmed by a Holocaust survivor himself yet presenting an objective take on the disturbing subject matter, The Pianist is the most personal film renowned director Roman Polanski has made in his decades-spanning career for it is crafted with meticulous care n attention, told with immaculate simplicity & also happens to feature one of cinema's most extraordinary performances.Based on the memoir of the same name & set in Warsaw during the Second World War, The Pianist tells the story of Władysław Szpilman; a Polish-Jewish musician who after avoiding deportation to Nazi labour camps tries to elude capture by living in the ruins of his city. The plot details his miraculous survival against all odds which wouldn't have happened without the kindness of few compassionate humans.Directed by Roman Polanski, The Pianist does bring back the horrors of the Holocaust and never shies away from depicting the barbaric treatment millions of Jews underwent during Nazi occupation. But it's not a tale about someone who caused an uprising or put his life on the line to save others but through one person, it tries to capture what most people under same circumstances were trying to do: survive, no matter what it takes.Polanski does manage to infuse his own history into the story but never lets that distract his own vision for the picture at hand, and there in lies the true beauty of this survival story. It's arguably the finest film that he's made & certainly the most artistic. Adding more strength to the feature is the brilliantly-written screenplay that keeps the focus on our protagonist at all times & resonates the brutality that millions underwent through his own life story.Coming to the technical aspects, every single element only ends up enhancing the entire experience. Production Design team does a superb job in recreating the war-torn city & set pieces are refined to smallest of details. Cinematography makes impeccable use of camera in capturing every frame plus the cold colour temperature encapsulates the whole film with a bleak mood. Editing paces its 149 minutes of runtime with precision. And classical music is beautifully incorporated into the narrative.Another thing that seals the destiny of The Pianist is the exceptional performance by Adrien Brody in the role of Władysław Szpilman that simply exceeded every expectation. Perfectly capturing not just the feeling of hopelessness, loneliness, grief & living under constant fear but also the desperation, survival instinct & passion for music, what Brody delivers here is one of cinema's most memorable performances that still ranks as his best and his Academy Award win for this role was deserving in every manner.On an overall scale, The Pianist marks the career high moment for Roman Polanski & Adrien Brody, is an emotionally devastating & powerfully moving cinema that's worthy of all the accolades it has garnered so far, and is amongst the finest examples of historical drama in existence. It certainly isn't going to be an easy sit for most but you'll be a better person for having done because some films, no matter how difficult, deserve to be viewed, and Roman Polanski's magnum opus is definitely one of those cinematic treasures. Strongly recommended.","

"bob the moo","2 April 2006","Wladyslaw Szpilman is a musician living with his family in 1930's Warsaw. The rise of anti-Semitism starts to erode their civil liberties, making them have permits to work, requiring them to wear armbands that identify them as Jewish and generally treating them like second-class citizens and lesser people. This gradual slide becomes increasingly serious as all Jews are ordered into one small area of the city, where whole families are given flats with one or two small rooms to be shared among six or seven people. As the murders and control of the Jews continue, Szpilman is left to try and survive while the war rages across Europe.I didn't bother to watch this in the cinema despite the Oscars and rave reviews simply because I could never get my head in the right space to spend my time on a subject that was never going to be an easy watch. With it coming onto television recently though I decided it was worth a look and easily got into it, which the emotional power of the story doing enough to carry it along for the duration. At times it does feel like watching war porn, as Polanski wheels out one more shocking atrocity after another and occasionally feels like he is involved in a game of one-upmanship with other Holocaust movies (so we don't just have a man thrown out a window, but a disabled old man thrown out a window). This was a bit of a problem for me because I wanted more to the film that just the horror shown to me. However the film does do more than that and generally does enough to be as impacting in the study of Szpilman as it is in just yet again reminding us of the terrible things done in Europe barely 60 years ago.On both levels the film works while never being something you should try and watch expecting it to be a fun night in. Staying away from the front line of the war, the film focuses on the effects on the innocent, specifically Szpilman, who struggles to just stay alive. Up till this point the film had been a bit obvious, with bad things happening while the Szpilman's argue over what to do etc, with the film relying heavily on the shock and horror of what was happening. The rest of the film is more about him being left alone and hidden within Warsaw, which although slow is still impacting and engaging. At this point Brody also steps up and becomes much better than before, showing so much with just a horrified look but still containing enough of a character to be more than just our eyes. The rest of the cast are all good but generally it is Brody that carries the majority of the film. Polanski directs with a very good eye for the breakdown of this world and it looks totally of period and convincing.Overall then, not a film to come to if you are hoping for a cheerful night in but one to watch to gain a wider appreciation of the atrocities that can so easily be allowed to take place. Ethnic cleansing and wars continue even as I sit writing these words so those that think this film is just an unnecessary wallow in past horrors would do well to take a minute and think. At times it could have been better but it is impossible to ignore the power of the story and the impact of the delivery.","

This is Polanski's finest film by far.Adrien Brody was magnificent, and his performance made you feel you were right there with him.It wasn't a pretty picture, the outstanding cinematography notwithstanding. Bodies lie in the streets, and people just passed them by. People were shot for asking a simple question.

"=G=","29 May 2003","""The Pianist"" is doubtless well crafted and technically and artistically sound albeit naive and conventional. The film parses into one hour of a stereotypical and exploitive regurgitation of the horrors of the Nazi reign over the Warsaw ghetto, where every German soldier is more evil than Satan and every Jew a pathetic victim, and one hour of Brody living like a rat foraging for sustenance amid the Warsaw ruination. Only in the very end does the film introduce a bit of irony and a sympathetic Nazi after countless missed opportunities to breath something fresh into what is just another in a very long list of films about the infamous ghetto (Families torn apart, summary executions, etc.).  Brody delivers a fine performance as a pianist and the film's centerpiece but is not required to perform the range of emotion deserving of a little gold statuette. Overall, the film is worthwhile but shows us nothing new and exploits rather than honors the memory of those Polish Jews who died in the conflict. ""The Pianist"" will play best with those who have not yet had their fill of Warsaw ghetto films. (B)","

Originally an actor in the war films of Andrzej Wadja, here he finally addresses head-on the childhood traumas in occupied Poland which obviously lay behind his other films (like Brody the young Polanski was used for target practise by Nazis.When they finally appear the Russians actually get pretty short shift, and considering their recent activities in Ukraine, the observation about the Poles that ""No one thought they'd hold out so long!"" must currently be giving Putin sleepless nights.","

"JamesHitchcock","20 January 2017","There have been innumerable films about World War II, but relatively few about the Holocaust, a subject which, at least for the first few decades after the war, seemed to daunt film-makers by its very enormity. Since the 1980s, however, there have been some fine attempts to come to terms with the most notorious crime of the twentieth century, including Pakula's ""Sophie's Choice"" and Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is another to add to this list.The film is based on the autobiography of Władysław Szpilman, a Jewish pianist, who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland. (As one character points out, Szpilman's surname is an appropriate one; it is a Polonised form of ""Spielmann"", the German for ""musician""). In September 1939 the Szpilman family are living in relative middle-class comfort in Warsaw when they learn that the country has been invaded by Germany. The film then traces the way in which the situation of Poland, and especially of its Jewish community, deteriorates throughout the course of the war- the passing of anti-Jewish laws, the creation of the Warsaw Ghetto in November 1940 and finally the deportations to the concentration camps beginning in 1942. By a stroke of chance Szpilman is separated from his family when they are deported to Treblinka extermination camp. For a time he becomes a slave labourer, but manages to escape and is sheltered by non-Jewish friends linked to the Polish resistance, surviving while thousands are dying around him and while his city is gradually turned into a wasteland of rubble.A key scene comes towards the end of the film. Much of the city, including the building in which Szpilman was sheltering, has been destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising of August 1944, and Szpilman is desperately trying to hide in a ruined building when he is discovered by a German officer named Wilm Hosenfeld. Hosenfeld guesses that Szpilman is Jewish, but takes pity on him and spares his life, even bringing him food and giving him a coat to help him survive.Szpilman's story had a deep personal significance for Polanski, himself a Polish Jew who managed to survive the war in hiding, although other members of his family, including his mother, died. It is therefore unsurprising that it has a greater emotional resonance than many of Polanski's earlier films, which can often be rather emotionally cool. Szpilman is a gifted musician, but his survival has very little to do with his talent and a great deal to do with the kindness of others and with sheer luck. It is a role which called for a superb actor, and Polanski was fortunate enough to find one in the shape of Adrien Brody, who won a well-deserved ""Best Actor"" Oscar. (Strangely enough, Brody was not the director's first choice for the role- that was Joseph Fiennes, who was unavailable). Brody's Szpilman becomes a sort of Everyman figure, a tragic version of Chaplin's Little Tramp, stumbling his way through a city which has been reduced to a vision of Hell on Earth. As Roger Ebert put it, he is not a fighter or a hero but a survivor.Polanski himself won the ""Best Director"" award. The film was nominated for Best Picture, but lost to ""Chicago"". ""The Pianist"" is a harrowing record of man's inhumanity to man, but it is also a film with a message of hope in that it shows how even unspeakable barbarity like that of the Nazis cannot altogether extinguish man's better instincts, shown by the kindness and bravery of Szpilman's friends and his defiant rendition of Chopin's Grande Polonaise Brillante at the end. It is one of the most moving films about the war that I know, comparable in this respect to either Pakula's or Spielberg's. 9/10","

"Pedro_H","1 February 2005","Roman Polanski is something of a genius for being in the middle of world history. Even if he had never made a film in his life his autobiography would still have been fascinating and history packed. I won't try and summate it in detail, but it involves an escape not unlike the one presented here on film! Having turned down Schindler's List (for reasons much noted elsewhere) he decides to make this as his tribute to the anti-Jewish horrors of WWII. Interesting.Despite the awards (all deserved) this is not what you might call a ""fat"" film. It has one main theme: ""self preservation"" in a world gone mad and that limits my sympathy and involvement. Indeed the protagonist (Adrian Brody) has something that people can envy even in his darkest hour - a great musical talent.The question I ask myself is how much of this lifesaver influences his decisions? While many gave up or joined in the resistance movement, Brody watches from the window: very much a curious and non Hollywood approach. Brave but not to everyone's taste.The real Warsaw Ghetto was featured in the great Granada documentary series ""The World at War"" (quite frankly the most amazing piece of historical television ever created - if you can rent it do so) and nothing can be as shocking as the real pictures. However this is a close second.The early scenes of family life are like the scenes from the Titanic, we know what those on screen don't and we feel like calling out and warning them! In many ways the information is soft peddled and tokenised. We do not see the actual horrors of the death camps and even post war the survivors look too healthy to be believable. The only bum note in the entire movie.Although I had nothing to do with the making of this film I am proud of it. I am proud that millions of people have been educated and will continue to be educated about the horrors of war and what man does to man. But I didn't really enjoy it very much and I have no desire to see it again despite having some wonderful pieces of cinematography.","

"Vincentiu","29 December 2011","A movie about survive. In dark nuances, with Shoah as scene, in the steps of gorgeous images, a story. A pianist, few miracles and music. A long trip in a large desert. And fear, hope and trust as only protection. It is a biographic piece but it speaks about values. It is a War tall but essence is peace behind reality. And it is a Polanski in which Adrien Brody is brilliant. For the art to discover each color of silent fight. For the strange occasions in which death is expected answer. But the final is a town in ruin, a Nazi officer and a piano. A kind of gift as birth of new time. Precise and not pathetic, harsh and dusty, cruel in a poetic manner, show of a life, it is one precious stone who remembers the respiration of earth and fragility of grass.","

"Thanos_Alfie","13 March 2021","""The Pianist"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we follow the life of a Polish Jewish pianist during World War II who is trying with all of his powers to survive. He sees a lot and he has to deal with many difficulties and surpass a lot of obstacles in order to survive.I liked this movie very much because it is based on true events and it presents very well the true face of World War II. The direction which was made by Roman Polanski, it was for one more time simply exceptional and he created another masterpiece. He succeeded on making us understand how his main character was feeling and made it easier for us to follow his story. The interpretation of Adrien Brody who played as Wladyslaw Szpilman was simply amazing and he deserved the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Emilia Fox's who played as Dorota and Thomas Kretschmann's who played as Captain Wilm Hosenfeld. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Pianist"" is an amazing movie that shows the cruel face of war and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.","

"henry8-3","5 May 2020","Follows a Jewish pianist (Brody) trying to survive in the Warsaw ghetto during WW2.A film broadly of 2 parts, the first covering the arrival of the nazis and its impact on the Jewish community most particularly Brody and his family. This is full of tension brought about the German atrocities and as the family descends further and further into hell. In many ways this is the most harrowing part of the film in that there are so many vulnerable family members to worry about as they move from disbelief and outrage to fear and some form of resignation.The bulk of the film though is a slow but fairly tense passage following Brody hiding and surviving alone in the empty ghetto, his life without food and warmth punctuated by moments of terror.The film is tense and like Schindler's List you do have this dreadful sense throughout of disbelief that this could have happened by people to people. Brody is very good in the lead and overall it is a considerable achievement - important to be sure. I just found that some passages took long to make their point - sorry.","

"diane-34","12 March 2005","Fortunately my wife convinced me to see this film on TV several nights ago; initially I was reluctant because I thought that it would end up being too tough for a overly sensitive softy like myself-how wrong I was! Polanski's film was not what I had expected; in all the publicity surrounding his return to films, I had failed to grasp the substance of the film. In hindsight this surprises me because for many years I have been curious as to why film makers had not focused on the extraordinary events of the Warsaw Ghetto and its eventual destruction by the Nazis. I have always thought that this event was one of the most powerful of a string of events that have been overlooked by film makers for years. The enormity of all that happened from '38 to '45 seem to have prevented people from mining the history of those years. It is conceivable that producers feel there is a fatigue clause at work here, meaning that there is possibly a feeling by producers that the public might be tired of non-military war films. Another possibility concerns the Jewish people themselves-a concern that they do not want this terribly painful history to be mined simply to provide fodder for film makers. Whatever the reason, there is to my mind a noticeable absence of films about these monumental but painful events of the mid twentieth century.Even given the drawbacks associated with watching a film on the small screen, this movie immediately gave the impression that it had the touch of genius about it. Polanski's superb direction; Brody's superb acting and Edelman's brilliant cinematography impart the stamp of excellence on the film. I am a film viewer who watches films as collections of images so Edelman's work knocked me out! The beauty of the clarity and darkness of the camera work was wonderful to watch. POlanski's shot selection of course allowed Edelman ample canvas upon which to paint in those wonderful grays and muted colours that were eventually seen on the screen. Diane and I have the tape of the film and it will definitely be watched many times in the future. In short, the film is as good as the awards that it justifiably received.","

"iquine","17 November 2022","Whenever I see Adrien Brody, my mind always takes me to this role first. So powerful! A Jewish classic pianist's career was upended in 1940 in Germany because of.....well, we all know the answer to that. This movie's telling of the methodical NAZI takeover and extermination of the Jewish people is brutal and chilling in detail. It portrays the crescendo of evil inflicted upon those people as their rights slowly were stripped away through the eyes of Wladyslaw Szpilman. This sugarcoats absolutely nothing. It sears many horrific scenes into your brain at the lack of any ounce of humanity by the NAZI's. It is of the highest quality in terms of production, screenplay, editing and of course the musical moments. This is top quality on this subject. Do not watch.....on a whim. You will be affected by this!!","

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","27 February 2008","""The Pianist"" is a film that is impossible to dislike. In fact, it may be impossible to love it as well. It's a traumatic and difficult biographical account of one of the many unbelievable Holocaust survival stories. What makes ""Pianist"" stand out, however is the traumatic realism, the way that the story evolves to strike an emotional chord in regards to the Nazi's crimes and the unique role of music in the film.""The Pianist"" is the Oscar-winning best adapted screenplay from the autobiography of Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), an accomplished Jewish pianist in Warsaw right as World War II strikes. The film plays out as several scenes following a timeline from the initial invasion to the Warsaw ghetto to Szpilman's many hideouts in the city throughout the war. While the true sense of time is skewed and thus the true agony of Szpilman's isolation unrealized, the timeline clearly shows how the Jews and everyone in Warsaw for that matter had their lives transformed.What makes this film so effective is the way Oscar winners Ronald Harwood (screenplay), but mostly director Roman Polanski, go right for your heartstrings. The Nazis are portrayed as cold-blooded killers. There is no emotional build-up or excessive suspense in the film's violent moments. It is sudden and mechanical, leaving you wondering how anyone could do such a thing, when the fact of the matter was that's exactly how it happened: many times arbitrary, heartless killing. The whole effect that Polanski has created with the violence being viewed by Szpilman and his family through windows, isolated from the mêlée, is very effective in the way that it connects with how the viewer is very much isolated from the true nature of the violence. Polanski conditions you to be afraid every time Szpilman looks out the window that violence might occur, which is exactly what Szpilman was: very curious about what was going on, but truly afraid. The effect is brilliant.The films third Oscar winner, Brody, doesn't give an emotionally moving performance per say, but his performance is award-worthy in its realism through exquisite use of non-verbal skills and his natural demeanor. You can tell how the war has transformed him as a person through each stage--from day one to the final moments of the film.If there's a weakness to the film, it's the fact that it doesn't spend enough time grasping Szpilman as a pianist. There is no sense as to how important his playing is or why he plays. Instead, the focus is more on the unfolding the events of WWII. While the idea the film presents of him being a pianist simply because that's what he knows to do is effective towards the end, a greater understanding of what playing the piano means to him would have been ideal in the beginning.""The Pianist"" is a tremendous achievement in terms of successfully telling a often repeated story in a way that is uniquely effective. It focuses on the aspect of the Holocaust that speaks to perseverance, basic survival in a life of fear that plays out outside your window. It is a tough film, but it's a good one.","

"claudio_carvalho","18 January 2004","Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a Polish Jewish pianist very famous in Warsaw. When Germany invades Poland, his wealthy family and him are sent to the Warsaw Ghetto. Them they are sent to Treblinka, but Szpilman escapes in the train station. He struggles to survive, hidden in the most different places and depending on friend's sympathy to stay alive. He survives the war and died in the year 2000. This movie is a super production, very well directed by Roman Polanski and having an outstanding performance of Adrien Brody. However, this sad story does not present anything that was not showed before, like, for example, `Schindler`s List' did some years ago. There is a good movie (`Uprising' (2001), TV), showing better the events of the Warsow Ghetto uprising, but the intention of `The Pianist' is to show the true saga of Szpilman. I can perfectly understand that Jewish persons, who are majority in the cinema industry, have a great interest in keeping alive the atrocities of the Second World War. But these movies are very repetitive, showing horrible dramas of the most different survivors, or persons who died. However, there are so many other massacres of races to be explored through the human history and unfortunately they are not showed in movies like the murder of Jewish in the WWII. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): `O Pianista' (`The Pianist')","

I've put this off for so long, because I simply thought it would be really dull. But wow, I've been wrong this whole time.The first hour is spectacular. The camera shots, the acting, the story and the feel of the film was all perfect. It really captured the realism of what it would have been like in them times. The one thing that was done perfectly throughout was that it captured the emotion of the characters and illustrated it so well.Speaking of characters. The arc of Adrien Brody's character was exceptional. Everything about him was done perfectly and it illustrated everything it needed to.Got to give props to Adrien Brody as well, phenomenal performance. Honestly one of the best I've seen in a long time.Only real negative I have to say is that I thought the final hour or so dragged at parts and it didn't need to be as long as it needed to. But this is nit picking.If you haven't seen please do. It's moving, emotional and just damn right amazing.","

"TxMike","26 June 2004","This movie is too long for what it depicts, one Jew's struggle to survive Nazi-occupied Warsaw during the second world war. The movie doesn't cover any new ground, the audience doesn't learn anything new. However, being a personal project for the director may account for its length. I hadn't planned to see it, because if you've seen one holocaust film, you've seen them all. And that is not in any way intended to minimize the horror of the mistreatment of the Jews, but how many times does a person need to see it reinacted to grasp the message? It happened, it was bad, we all need to do our part to see that nothing like that happens again. But I saw it for Adrien Brody, the hawkish actor who won the best actor Oscar for his performance. And, after seeing it, I believe it was deserved. The first hour of the movie established the setting and danger, the middle hour spends too much time showing the protagonist trying to survive, hiding in bombed-out buildings, scratching for food. We know it all happened, but if you show everything, the movie is 6 years long!!  The movie starts with actual black and white film footage of 1939 Warsaw, and we see its residents leading normal lives for that period. Then, cut to the movie, the pianist is playing for a live radio broadcast when bombs or artillery shells begin to explode and all Jewish families begin their fights for survival. Forced to wear identifying arm bands, eventually they were banished to their own ghetto, then the trains came. SPOILERS are contained in the rest of my comments, for my own recollection, please read no further. The last half hour of the movie pulls everything together. The pianist is helped by a German soldier who discovers him, has him play piano for him, then secretly brings him food as the war winds down. When the Russians finally come to Warsaw, the few remaining Jews are out of danger, the Germans are imprisoned, and eventually the pianist is playing again for the radio, and the final scene is his playing a concert before a live audience. The pianist was a real person, this movie is a true story based on his book.","

"truemythmedia","11 November 2019","If I'm being honest, I think Polanski winning the best director Oscar for this film is sort of like Scorsese winning his Oscar for ""The Departed""; both awards feel a bit like consolation Oscars. What do I mean by that? Well, I don't believe that this is the best film Polanski has put out; in fact, I wouldn't even put it in his top three. It is a good film, however, and with all the amazing movies that Polanski produced during his career I'm glad that he found a bit of recognition, even if it is for a film that isn't as polished as some of his others.Polanski himself said that his was the most personal film he's ever made, and there's good reason for that. Polanski was in his preteens when WWII washed over Poland, and he, like Wladyslaw Szpilman, survived the ghettos while their families were less fortunate (Polanski's mother was killed in Auschwitz). ""The Pianist"" shows a side of the holocaust that we rarely see, for it's not from the perspective of the camps which we see most of the film, but from the perspective of one who has escaped the camps and is still forced to live in a prison of isolation and degradation.As a whole, I think the story told in this movie is wonderful, and since it is based on a true story, it's hard to criticize it too much for structure, but at the same time, I do feel that this movie starts to drag in the second act. Most of the truly disturbing stuff happens in the first half of this film. The parts where Szpilman is separated from his family, the purging of the ghetto, the moving to concentration camps... all of that stuff happens within the first hour and fifteen minutes, and the last hour of this movie is mostly focused on Szpilman trying to stay quiet in apartments, trying to figure out what's gong on outside, and struggling to get over sickness. By no means does the story ever get boring- it's still fascinating, but the horrors of the first half of this movie are far more memorable than those in the second half.","

Seeing his transformation into a holocaust survivor and giving 100% into the role made this one of the best performances I've seen this year.

"yoyomagoo","24 March 2003","I despise the term overrated (partly because of its often use on IMDB) but this movie is the dictionary definition of the term. How did it win those oscars? Why it is in the top 250? I don't know.Polanski's tribute to the holocaust is a largely pedestrian affair that suffers from a lack of style and tautness. The inclusion of many scenes in the movie is mysterious considering the fact they hold little relevance to either the holocaust or the Brody's character's story. The film therefore feels bloated and self-important. Polanski does not treat the subject matter with any opinion or style- and just shows us what happens before casually strolling onto the next scene. Polanski would argue that this is because the subject matter does not need any style or opinion added to it, which is fair enough. However the problem with this is, that it is extremely dull for the audience. The ""powerful"" elements of the movie are few and far between, bluntening their impact. Also, towards the middle of the film, there seems to be a genuinely scary lack of substance and we get treated to lots of long shots contrasted with close-ups. What this is supposed to tell us, is also a mystery. While the movie must be commended for its treatment of the subject matter and Adrien Brody's excellent performance, it feels more guided rather than directed. Its casual attitude to the violence seems mundane rather than shocking and there is nothing here that Steven Spielberg didn't do better in Schindler's List. Essentially dull, rather than powerful, only the last 45 minutes make this film memorable. 6/10","

"LW-08854","27 December 2023","Revisiting this film I found it really holds up very well. The film opens with invasion and the coming occupation of Warsaw, a family must now decide whether to flee, and if so where to go? Our main character is a middle-class musician, cultured, well dressed, handsome but his world is now turned up side down. The early scenes of the city apartments being emptied, of glass smashing, radio falling silent and distress are all really well directed and acted. We next move now to the Warsaw ghetto and the casual brutality and contempt the occupiers now display to the inhabitants. Our main character is still able to work as a pianist but his life now is looking increasingly precarious. The family fortune dwindles, money has little value anymore. You really have to give high praise to the costumes, props and locations, I really felt myself there living it. This is an English language film but you don't really hear any English accents which at least helps. It has a bit of a desaturated look but it's still very much something shot on film and not at all like some digital films we get now. The story is very much that of the pianist, everything that happens we see through his eyes. The thuggery and terror brought by the Nazis is revolting and shocking. There's a tiny bit of CGI but mostly it's all in camera and I have to give the production values very high praise. At times I did slightly loose track of what year it was, maybe that's deliberate. I also found our main character very passive, there's no mad heroics, no impassioned speeches from him, he's probably too shocked for anything remotely like that. As I said it's very much his story, we have no sense of who's winning or losing the war, no cut aways to generals looking at maps or giving out orders really. There's some great physical acting in here too, our main character's appearance change so much as he lives a more and more hunted and animal like life. He is truly just a survivor in an increasingly dangerous landscape. We see some acts of defiance and resistance, his life though is terribly lonely and he carries with him his love of music throughout his life on the run.","

"Smells_Like_Cheese","1 November 2004","Man, I can not get this film out of my head. It is so rare that a movie can affect me the way ""The Pianst"" did. The last movie that did that was ""Casino"". I was really tired when I was watching the movie. It was almost midnight, so I was thinking that I'll start watching and I'll finish it in the morning. Did I? No, indeed I did not stop watching. I couldn't stop it. I just wanted to see what would happen next. I cried during ""Schindler's List"", I sobbed in this film. Everything that happens in this film is so sad. Adrien Brody does a remarkable job of acting in this film. I would very highly recommend this film. Especially if you are a history buff. Please, I think this film should be in the top 10 best films of all time.I looked on the message boards you know and some other user comments that didn't enjoy this film much, they criticized Adrien Brody's performance and say that he was boring and only showed emotions that are easy to act. Please, you have got to be kidding me. This man portrayed the total feeling of hopelessness, being alone, being hated. I one time had an audition in high school like this to see if I could improvise, and the way I imagined this feeling is like in dodgeball where you have no one else on your team and you're the only one left standing, yet on the other team there is 20 big men that are just waiting to wack that ball at you. Adrien couldn't have done a better job, I was so frightened for him and cried for him during the whole film while he was one the run.Roman Polanski as the director, he himself escaped the terrors of being a prisoner in The Holocaust, yet he lost his mother and other family members. Yes, I'm sure this film must have been hard to re create for him, but he was probably the only director that could have done this movie as brilliantly as he did. He created this story and made it so effective, I called up my mom and told her that I loved her so much because we take so many things for granted. True, this isn't the 1930's or 40's, and we are in America. But it's still frightening to think that human beings are capable of that much hate and being so brutal to another human. World War II is one of the most frightening wars in history, if you read more about The Holocaust, you get more into it and you should. If you are not interested, then watch this film. It's a must see, otherwise how else will we learn from our mistakes? The Pianist is a beautiful and extremely dark tale about a man and the struggle to survive. The ending is so powerful and moving to know that sometimes one man can make a difference in a crowd of so many and I'm not talking about Adrien Brody's character. You'll see what I mean.10/10","

In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust. This movie came close to Schindlers list in depicting the horrors of Holocaust. Brody puts in a marvelous and utterly touching performance. The story depicts the emotional and cultural breakdown of persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them.

"baumer","27 March 2003","I can remember when this film came out I was adamantly against seeing it. I had my preconceived notions that it would be some other heroic Jewish Holocaust film where good triumphs over evil and in between we would see some brutal atrocities committed by the Germans to add some flavour.How wrong I was.This is one of the best films I have ever seen and what it did to me I cannot describe in words. But in a nutshell, it moved me, made me cry, made me feel like I was in the Polish ghetto in 1940, and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as I walked out of the theater and thanked God that I live in the free society that I do. Roman Polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby but this is his crowning achievement. I think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years Oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film. I believe that the Oscar's are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else, so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year, it tells you that it should have won best picture but the Weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone, hence a charlatan like Chicago takes top prize. Sorry for the digression here but when you compare a ""film"" like Chicago to a masterpiece like The Pianist, there really is one clear cut winner. They handed out the statue to the wrong movie.The Pianist follows up and coming piano player Wlad Spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos, surviving only by the kindness of strangers. I think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because Spielzman is a man that we can all relate to. He is not a hero, he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge. He is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. He is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can. Only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide. And this is how I related to him. If put in his position, how would I react? Exactly the way he did. This is a man that had everything taken from him. His livelihood, his family, his freedom and almost his life. There is no time for heroics here. Adrien Brody embodies the spirit of Spielzman and his win at this years Oscars was one of the happiest moments I have had watching the festivities. His speech was even better but that is a topic for another time.Ultimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the German soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes I've witnessed. With very little dialogue, it is in the eyes, the face, the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know. I think it is this scene that won Brody his Oscar. This is one of the all time great performances.I think Polanski spoke from the heart here. He has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other. I think The Pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done, Chicago will be forgotten the way Ordinary People was forgotten and when people talk about the film The Pianist, they will do so with reverence and respect. This is a cinematic masterpiece.10 out of 10","

"FilmOtaku","28 April 2003","The Pianist is the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, at the time Poland's most acclaimed pianist whose life is transformed during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw beginning in 1939.  The film spans several years and maps his many personal trials in addition to providing the perspectives of his family, rebel factions and sympathizers.Brilliantly directed by Roman Polanski and starring an amazing Adrien Brody, The Pianist is bound to garner comparisons to Schindler's List, for obvious reasons.  However similar the subject matter, the approach is different. While Schindler's List was filmed in a beautiful, crisp black and white that offered many incredible images, The Pianist was filmed with almost muted color.  Schindler's List featured what has been argued as a complicated hero.  Oskar Schindler did save many Jews, but not without battling his own materialistic demons first.  The Pianist's Szpilman is a sympathetic character throughout.  His plight was desperate, and the demons he fought were over his own guilt in surviving a fight that eventually turns into a primal will to live.Polanski does not spare the viewer any grief with his film.  The horrific scenes between the Nazis and the Warsaw Jews were more terrifying and horrible than any horror/suspense movie I have seen in some time, possibly ever.  The humiliation and complete loss is wrenching.  In several scenes, Jews are lined up in the middle of the night and subjected to either torture or death.  In one case, a woman asks of a Nazi officer, ""What will happen to us?"" and is promptly shot point blank in the head.  The camera does not flinch or subdue any of these atrocities.A mention must be made of Brody's performance.  Having only previously seen Brody in two other films, Spike Lee's ""Summer of Sam"" and Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" (a part that was supposed to be his launch into stardom before his part was unfortunately cut drastically) I knew his potential was great.  After his Oscar win, I viewed this movie with more criticism than I normally would have and he certainly did not disappoint.  He transcended my expectations.  His physical transformation was amazing, but more importantly, he conveyed the sorrow of this man shockingly well - in both verbal and non-verbal contexts.  It will be very interesting to see what kind of opportunities this role will afford him, and the kinds of roles he will accept.Something worth mentioning is the affect this movie had on the audience with whom I viewed this film.  Normally, when a film ends, the regular hardcore filmsters like myself will stay and watch the credits in their entirety. The rest of the audience stands up and leaves, usually to the chagrin of the remaining enthusiasts.  This was one of the few times I have seen a film at a theater where not one person stood to leave during the final credits. It wasn't until the house lights came up at the end did people begin to disperse.  Personally, I hightailed it out of the theater the second the lights came on because not only was my face a mess from crying during the film (Tammy Faye comes to mind) but I had this overwhelming need for an emotional release, so when I reached my car I sat and wept for about five minutes.  It has been years since I have watched a film that upset me to that extent. Conversely, while discussing this film with my brother, (someone who loves movies as much and has similar tastes as I do) he mentioned that while he thought the movie was excellent, he wasn't as profoundly emotionally effected as I was.  After thinking about this for a couple of days, I realized the difference: The music.  As a classical music enthusiast and erstwhile musician, the thought of not being able to enjoy, much less play the music you love is a tragic one.  Then the emotional outpouring that comes when you return to it - there aren't words to describe how intense that is.  Not having the same appreciation for this musical genre, one will be able to sympathize with the physical and emotional tribulations, but perhaps not in the musical sense.The Pianist was truly an astonishing film.  I was riveted from start to finish and so emotionally affected that I couldn't even consider writing a review until a week later.  Having said that, I am filing this away with my list of movies which include Schindlers List and Philadelphia, as films that I love but cannot rewatch for a long time after due to their intensely emotional content.--Shelly","

"jotix100","21 January 2003","The Pianist is an incredible film in many aspects. Roman Polanski's account of the survival of the pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is a document about how one man can overcome the worst possible situations in a world gone completely mad around him.The only fault one can find with the adaptation of Mr. Szpilman's story by playwright Ronald Harwood, is the fact that we never get to know the real Wladyslaw Szpilman, the man, as some of the comments made to this forum also have indicated.There is a very interesting point raised by the the pianist's father who upon reading something in the paper, comments about how the Americans have forgotten them. Well, not only the Americans, but the rest of the world would not raise a finger to do anything for the people that were being imprisoned and made to live in the confined area of Warsaw. The exterminating camps will come later. What is amazing in the film, is the frankness in which director Polanski portrays the duplicity of some Jews in the ghetto. The fact that Jews were used to control other Jews is mind boggling, but it was a fact, and it's treated here matter of factly. Had this been made by an American director, this aspect would have never surfaced at all. Yet, Mr. Polanski and Mr. Harewood show us that all was not as noble and dignified as some other films have treated this ugly side of war.  Wladyslaw Szpilman, as played by Adrien Brody, is puzzling sometimes, in that we never get to know what's in his mind. He's a man intent in not dying, but he's not a fighter. He accepts the kindness extended to him. He never offers to do anything other than keep on hiding, which is a human instinct. He will never fight side by side with the real heroes of the ghetto uprising. His role is simply to witness the battle from his vantage point in one of the safe houses across the street from where the action takes place.Adrien Brody is an interesting actor to watch. As the pianist of the story he exudes intelligence. There is a scene where Szpilman, in one of the safe houses he is taken, discovers an upright piano. One can see the music in his head and he can't contain himself in moving his fingers outside the closed instrument playing the glorious music from which he can only imagine what it will sound in his mind.The supporting cast is excellent. Frank Findlay, a magnificent English actor is the father of the pianist and Maureen Lipman, another veteran of the stage, plays the mother with refined dignity.In watching this film one can only shudder at the thought of another conflict that is currently brewing in front of our eyes. We wonder if the leaders of the different factions could be made to sit through a showing of The Pianist to make them realize that war is hell.","

"classicsoncall","3 February 2013","Fortunately, I'm able to keep my personal feelings about Roman Polanski compartmentalized enough to say that this was a remarkable film. I've read many comparisons between ""The Pianist"" and ""Schindler's List"" on this board, and even though the films are quite different, the overpowering portrayals of Man's inhumanity against Man will leave the viewer forever affected. Adrien Brody's Best Actor award was stunningly achieved here, as his character arcs through an incredible series of circumstances to barely survive life in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II. What little I knew of director Polanski outside of his marriage to Sharon Tate, the grisly Manson murders, and his rape conviction in the late 1970's, was put into an entirely different perspective when I learned about his own life in the Polish Ghetto. Much of what we see in the film must emanate from his own unique experience as a child during the War and experiencing Nazi atrocity first hand. I don't envy anyone who survived that experience enduring the painful daily memories of those times.Given the film's title, I guess I was somewhat surprised by the paucity of musical sequences, though what was offered was artistically presented. Particularly poignant was the scene when Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) was left to hide in an apartment where a piano was available, and he mimed his way through a selection from memory by the need to maintain silence.Many years following the end of World War II, a single film cannister simply marked ""The Ghetto"" was discovered, revealing valuable insight into how the Nazi propaganda machine attempted to manipulate public opinion about 'rich' Jews who lived in luxury alongside fellow Jews in squalid conditions. Even more intimate details of life in the Warsaw Ghetto are presented in ""Shtikat Haarchion"" (A Film Unfinished), describing conditions that are even more horrific than those depicted in ""The Pianist"" or ""Schindler's List"", if that can even be imagined. These movies exist for a higher calling as a constant reminder that the term ""Never Again"" be one to constantly take seriously in an ever increasingly dangerous world.","

"Quinoa1984","16 January 2003","The Pianist tells the story of such a man in war time Poland, played by Adrien Brody, who from start to finish sees his life literally getting worse and worse and worse- starts off with new rules from the Nazis, then the stars on the arms, followed by the Warsaw ghetto, and while there he could play in the restaurant, that too soon ended, as the trains arrived and took his family and anyone else he knew away.  During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  This is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).In conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski's best, a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or.  Great music too. A+","

"dtb","9 January 2004","This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :-) -- rightly so, since title character Wladyslaw Szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways!  It's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off.  It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away.  (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there's no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest `safe house' has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head.  Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I've seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD's flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody's job often was), I'd be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won! (Besides, the rest of the 2002 Best Actor nominees already won Oscars -- this time it was dark horse Brody's turn! :-)","

"Nazi_Fighter_David","6 September 2005","'The Pianist' is definitively an inspiring epic that celebrates the tenacity and fortitude of the human spirit... It is a remarkable tale of human survival sensitively brought to life by Polanski... The film carries us to the horrible reign of terror, where condemned people wearing the emblem of humiliation and oppression, are deprived of their rights, their human values and dignity, before being shipped to 'labor camps.' In Polanski's movie all the conventional elements of the drama are at peaks of excellence: Family union: When a father has to bargain to buy a single piece of caramel and divide it in six pieces to share it with each member of his family...Starvation: When a ghetto inhabitant assaults a helpless woman for a bowl of soup... Confusion: When a distraught woman wails on a platform because she smothered the cries of her baby with her hand...Love: When a young musician turns to his younger sister and utters with sad regret, ""I wish I knew you better."" Survival: When one man observes the war through his hide-outs around the city...Cruelty: When an old man in a wheelchair is thrown off the balcony by the Nazis because he failed to stand upon their entrance...Fear: When a talented musician sits down at the old piano, and pretends to play his music, keeping his fingers flowing with control above the vertical ivories...Discrimination: When bored Nazi guards entertain themselves by forcing grotesquely mismatched old and sick couples to dance to a Jewish street band by the ghetto gate...Horror: When condemned Jewish workers lie face-down in the street, while one SS guard walks down the line, shooting without remorse each one in the back of the head... Isolation: When a fugitive emerges from his harrowing hiding place and walks through a field of deserted ruins exactly like the last man alive on Polish soil..Adrien Brody gives an absolutely moving performance (based on descriptive facial expressions) as the Polish composer and pianist who stays alive as a Jew, and remains true to his ideals... Brody captures the character's desperation, his anger and grief, his willpower and perseverance, his passion and love of music... Polanski gives us the chance to better know his shock and disbelief, his ordeal and tragedy, his hope for fairness and humanity...Nominated for seven Academy Awards, this captivating drama went on to win three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay... Once Brody took the stage to accept his Oscar, he was so overwhelmed with happiness, that he swept the gorgeous Academy Award-winning Halle Berry off her feet with a long, steamy kiss...","

"baba44713","7 April 2005","I remember seeing ""Schindler's list"" about ten years ago, and I remember how weird I felt for being almost completely unmoved by it. Although it showed the horrors of holocaust quite realistically, somehow it all seemed just a bit too fake and exaggerated. Characters were a bit off (I still can't decide who was more over the top, Schindler or Goeth), fake sentimentalism was all over the place, . While it was a work of art and an important reminder of true events that shouldn't be forgotten, on emotional level it just somehow failed to deliver.Enter ""The Pianist"". With no Spielberg around to put his trademark sappy material, we finally have a movie that shows the true horror and tragedy of Jewish people in World War II. The story is told through the eyes of one man - Wladislaw Szpielman, Jewish pianist who works in a radio station in Warsaw during the German occupation of Poland. Together with him we watch his world getting torn apart, witness his family being taken away, his existence being reduced to bare essentials. Brody gives a subtle yet spectacular performance, his best work yet. And never once are we reminded that we are watching a movie. Everything is shown from Szpielman's point of view, and it is all very gritty and realistic. While Spielberg's rendition of German atrocities always had a slightly staged feel to augment their dramatic purpose, here they are so true to life there impact is much greater - you watch and are being reminded in horror that this things actually happened.While being very hard to watch sometimes, this is a movie that ""Schindler's List"" was supposed to be. This movie doesn't judge anybody, or tries to explain anything - it shows historical events as a reflection of one man's fate, making a powerful testimony that stays with you long after the beautiful last shot and the end credits are over.","

"Xanan","20 January 2003","The Pianist is an account of the true life experience of a Polish pianist during WW2, in the context of the deportation of the Jewish community to the Ghetto of Warsaw, a setting virtually absent from all films inspired on WW2.
Polanski (himself a child survivor of the Krakow and Warsaw ghettos) could have described in more detail the legendary, desperate fighting of the Jewish resistance in the ghetto of Warsaw, or the horrific mass extermination in concentration camps. Instead, the film gains in intensity by displaying the war from the pianist's own point of view (through windows, half-opened doors, holes in the walls - with big emphasis on the use of ""point of view shooting"" by the cameraman). One cannot help feeling disturbed by the most enthralling scenes of the film, as the isolated pianist tries to ensure his survival in the ghetto and ruins of Warsaw, hiding and fleeing, moving from one bombed house to the next, gradually becoming a shadow of his former self, hungry and afraid (merit largely attributed to the extraordinary performance by Adrien Brody, who visibly loses half of his weight throughout the film).Does the pianist raise any sympathy from the audience? Not immediately, in my view. The pianist is more than often a drifting character, almost a witness of other people's and his own horrors. He seems to float and drift along the film like a lost feather, with people quickly appearing and disappearing from his life, some helping generously, others taking advantage of his quiet despair, always maintaining an almost blank, dispassionate demeanour. One may even wonder why we should care in the least about this character. But we do care. That is, I believe, the secret to this film's poetry.In one of the strongest scenes, towards the end, a German officer forces the pianist to play for his life, in an episode that suddenly brings a much lighter, beautifully poetic shade to the film (this German officer will be probably compared to Schindler, although his philanthropy does not quite share the same basis).This is also a wonderful tribute to Polish artists, through Chopin's music, with the concert at the very end of the film and the opening performance by the pianist at the local radio station (with the sound of bomb explosions in the background) forming an harmonious link between the beginning and end of the film (following Polanski's usual story-frame).Overall, The Pianist is one of the most detailed and shocking accounts of the treatment of the Jews by the Nazis, with the atmosphere in Warsaw well captured and believable. Quite possibly, The Pianist will remain in the history of film-making as the most touching and realistic portraits of the holocaust ever made.Polanski's film deserves a strong presence in the 2003 Oscar nominations, including a nomination for Adrien Brody's amazing performance, Polanski's sublime direction, best adapted screenplay and, obviously, best picture. This could be, at last, Polanski's long awaited, triumphal comeback to the high and mighty Hollywood.","

"Hitchcoc","10 September 2009","There have been so many fine films that deal with the Holocaust. Each shows the atrocities of the Germans, their random cruelty, their ruthlessness. This film has all that, but it also has Adrien Brody. This is a film that gets us inside the human being, the person who must run, whose iron will propels him forward. The thing is, though, he is not necessarily a hero in the traditional sense. We sense the fatigue of his character as he runs from situation to situation, just trying to stay alive. There are good people around him, many are good Germans. While we watch people shot in the head, beaten to the ground, mutilated, we see him moving aimlessly toward something (the thing is we don't know what that something is). He hears rumors about the Russians liberating Poland but he can't let up for a second. He watches as the underground makes sacrifice after sacrifice, their building burned, their people sent up in flames. He sees himself as a coward. He thinks about being dead, but his will to live drives him on. The title, of course, is him--the pianist--a nationally known classical pianist, suddenly dehumanized. We see his weaknesses and his strengths. We also get a more balanced though terrifying view of the situation in the Polish ghetto. This is a film we should all see.","

"Leofwine_draca","19 April 2017","THE PIANIST is a film that takes a dark and disturbing subject matter - the persecution of the Warsaw Jews by Nazis in the Second World War - and turns it into a spellbinding, enthralling journey of a movie. Roman Polanski could easily have made this maudlin and sentimental like Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST, but he thankfully avoids that temptation and the result is the much better movie of the two.This film contains a documentary-style realism in its depiction of the various atrocities carried out by the uncaring Germans. It gets dark and darker as it goes on, and yet the viewer is unable to tear his eyes off the screen because it's all so well-realised and realistic. Adrien Brody plays the eyes and ears of the viewer in a subdued manner, yet delivers his greatest and most believable performance as a result. The story has a lot of darkness and violence, but Polanski's expert camera-work and endless style stops the subject matter ever becoming depressing; instead there's enough tension to keep you involved and wanting to find out what's next. Things build to a suitably touching and poignant climax that doesn't disappoint.","

"ashcoounter","1 February 2003","Polanski has depicted the gory details of the holocaust without much restraint. But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.Every single act of escapade Szpilman goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.Overall, Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.Pawel Edelman's camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.Hervé de Luze's editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.The scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.Great film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars. I will give it a 9 Out of 10.","

"rmax304823","30 April 2008","Film makers have to step carefully when dealing with issues like the Nazi extermination program. There have been equally brutal programs of ethnic cleansing in places like Southeast Asia and Rwanda, in which hundreds of millions died, but nothing like this in Europe since the Middle Ages. The victims here were not only Jews but Gypsies, the mentally ill, homosexuals, socialists, communists, and political undesirables. The Nazis eliminated not six million but some uncountable number between 12 and 15 million. An event like that can't be treated lightly and milked for easy tears, or the event itself is cheapened.Fortunately, the films that have explored the subject have been uniformly well done, as Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is well done. Polanski himself suffered in much the same way as the protagonist, Vlad Szpilman (Adrien Brody). Polanski has a habit of embellishing his tales but there's no question that in this instance he knows what he's talking about.Szpilman is a well-known young pianist on Warsaw radio but the German occupation puts the station out of business. He and his family are herded into the Warsaw ghetto where they are subject to constant abuse and occasional murder. Szpilman barely escapes being sent to Treblinka with the rest of his family. And for the last half of the film, with the help of some friends who endanger themselves by lending him aid, he scuttles rat-like from one hiding place to another, each more dismal and perilous than the last. He suffers jaundice, his hair and beard grow long, his clothes turn to tatters, his food disappears, he's half frozen, and he seems to shrink.He's reduced to living in the attic of a nearly demolished apartment building and is ecstatic to discover a gallon can of pickles overlooked on the top shelf of a kitchen cabinet. The can falls out of his hands while he tries to open it and rolls across the floor to come to rest at the boots of a German officer, Captain Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann). The only Germans we've seen so far have been brutes -- ridiculing the insane, executing Jews who ask simple questions, or simply shooting people chosen at random.We expect nothing from Hosenfeld except a quick shooting. But Hosenfeld is a human being and, having discovered that Szpilman ""is"" -- or rather ""was"" -- a pianist, he asks him to play a piano left in one of the flats. Szpliman has been unable to play for years and when he seats himself we worry that he might not bring it off and, indeed, his first chords are tentative, uncertain. Then his playing becomes automated, the old habits return, and he dashes off a dramatic and exquisitely executed piece of Chopin. Hosenfeld has been leaning back, enjoying the music, then leaves Szpilman quietly to his attic. He returns a few times later, before the Germans withdraw before the Russians, and unceremoniously hands him a few packages of food and, finally, his overcoat. The matter-of-fact compassion shown by Hosenfeld, and Szpilman's desperate need for contact with another human, are very moving.When the Russian troops finally arrive, Szpilman stumbles out of his hovel to greet them, but seeing his overcoat the Russians open fire on him. Szpilman finally convinces them that he is a Pole, not a German, and one of the befuddled soldiers asks, ""Then why the ****ing coat?"" Szpilman is trembling with fear but manages to gulp, ""I was cold."" An epilogue tells us that Szpilman went on with his career and Hosenfeld wound up in a Soviet prison camp where he died in 1952, despite Szpilman's attempt to find him. Under the end credits, a smiling Szpilman plays a lively, sparkling composition by Chopin.It's a remarkable film. Polanski is no longer the Wunderkind but a mature film maker. Nothing is excessive. We need only as much as we need to know to understand Szpilman's travails -- one tragedy following another. There are no sentimental speeches at the final parting of Szpilman and his family. Szpilman himself never breaks down. He simply does what needs to be done to survive. And Adrien Brody captures what Szpilman must have been like. (From some angles he resembles the young Arthur Rubenstein.) Kretschmann gets Hosenfeld down pat as well. In their scenes together we sense their respective positions -- one man with nothing left to lose, the other with nothing left to gain. The story, and the historical facts it's based on, raise many questions about human nature, of course. I'm not at all sure that if we could find the answers to those questions we would like what we found.One of the better films of the year.","

"KineticSeoul","16 February 2011","This is a well crafted movie that deserves some praise, but I still felt the film is a bit overrated. I guess it's cause I was expecting a phenomenal and amazing movie, but what I got was a pretty good movie. It just wasn't as powerful or compelling as I thought it would be. Adrien Brody was almost perfect for this role, his transition from being a prideful musician to a broken down man was done really well. This film just wasn't all that challenging, the plot is basically based on a true story of Władysław Szpilman(Adrien Brody). And his struggle to survive during the Holocaust. The thing is the whole thing seems a bit conventional a lot of aspect of this movie just seemed to narrow at times and straightforward which isn't necessarily a good thing and lack depth. The film also seemed to drag a bit because of the direction it kept going, it's a good movie and I agree with some of the positive feedback this film has been getting. It just isn't a powerful or amazing film I was looking forward to seeing, not one of those movies I feel I need to see again someday after it's finished.

"Xstal","28 October 2020","Around 30% of Warsaw's population was Jewish in 1939, about 375,000 people; with refugees, the population of the ghetto rose to 450,000 - over 80,000 perished in it; deportations to Treblinka began in July 1942 (Yad Vashem).I would rather have seen this film in the languages of those it portrays using actors from the countries and regions where these despicable, heinous and unforgivable events took place. It would have made an already immensely powerful reflection even more so.","

"orangeisthenewawesome","21 February 2011","My husband and I decided to watch this on netflix one night as we had heard it was good. Neither of us had any expectations and figured if it won a couple of Oscars it must be decent. I had no idea it was an absolute masterpiece. This may be one of the best movies I have seen to date. Days after I saw this movie I cannot stop visualizing the images and feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. The cinematography is breathtaking. The beauty of pre-devastation Warsaw is sharply contrasted with the bleakness of the ghetto, and it would be understatement to say how haunting the visuals of Warsaw after the bombings were. The acting here is tremendous. Brody (who I had really not seen in anything else significant prior to this) carries the entire movie on his wan shoulders. He conveys so much with pain, anguish, hope, and loss with just his eyes. It is quite the actor who causes the viewer to feel the pain he is experiencing as a character. This was an extremely well deserved acting Oscar.This movie is extremely depressing considering the subject matter but it is told and portrayed with grace and power by Polanski. So many scenes are powerful and haunting. To me, in many ways this is a perfect movie. Yes, I know this review is filled with hyperbole, but I simply cannot remember the last time I was so moved and impressed by a film as I was with the Pianist. See it at least once.","

The acting is not over the top it's completely realistic and Adrien Brody is MAGNIFICANT! If you don't shed a tear or get chills watching this true story then you have no soul!","

"Sleepin_Dragon","28 January 2023","Polish musician Wladyslaw Szpillman tries to cope with life in Naxi occupied Warsaw.I only recently watched Schindler's list, and was so moved, IMDb recommended The Pianist, and I was not disappointed, this was an incredibly powerful, moving, but upsetting movie.It charts the sequence of events, first the Polish Jews are moved from their homes, robbed, and placed into ghettos, made to wear a star of David, then finally moved into Concentration Camps.It just amazes me to think how and why these atrocities actually happened, still in living memory for some, surely one of the most shocking times in human history. You see the violence ramp up as the film progresses.It's an incredibly well made film, it looks terrific, people look very much of that time, surely a consideration the casting director used.Several things that always stayed with me, someone begging with a corpse laying on the ground that was one moment, another being the elderly man in the wheelchair, harrowing sequences.I thought Adrien Brody was excellent as Szpillman, a very understated performance, totally sincere, incredibly believable. Ed Stoppard, Frank Findlay, Maureen Lipman and others all so good.It's a long film, but incredibly rewarding.10/10.","

"zetes","6 July 2003","The Pianist is far from Roman Polanski's best film or his `most personal work,' as the back of the DVD case says. In fact, it's easily the least personal film I've seen from him; any director who has enough clout to secure the funding for the production could have made this film and had it turn out just as well. As a director, it is a small achievement. Likewise, the screenplay writes itself; in fact, it did write itself, as it's based on a true story. I must admit I have a bias against films dealing with WWII and especially the Jewish experience in Europe. Affecting the audience is as simple as snapping one's fingers. Or, more specifically, executing a Jew. Whenever the audience starts to get a little comfortable, all the filmmaker has to do is have a Nazi shoot a Jew in the head. It's all too easy. Any film with that subject matter is automatically deemed important in the minds of critics and audiences, which makes it difficult for anyone to propose any criticism against it. Truth be told, The Pianist is a very good film. It's well done, and, while I don't think it's Polanski's best work, he does a good job. But it's too easy, I think, to overpraise something like this. It was very entertaining that this movie caused so many upsets at the Oscars, but, after seeing the film, it doesn't surprise me. This is the kind of movie that impresses the Academy most, because it's easy. The three awards it won were not deserved, at least in my opinion. If I weren't so familiar with the Academy and their thought processes, it would really shock me that Polanski beat Scorsese, who made an original picture with verve and passion, and that Brody (I haven't mentioned him, and he is good) beat Daniel Day-Lewis, who, as I've just said above, creates a character that will live forever. As for the screenplay, Ronald Harwood (and/or Polanski) could have made the film much more than just one of ten thousand tales of survival. There are a lot of moments when more substance could have been found. I like how Szpilman has to constantly watch the action while locked up in a room, yearning to be able to do something about it, but always relegated to the spectator's role. They do do well when they introduce the character of the Nazi soldier trying to make good by helping Szpilman, but they don't do very much. Of course, I think part of the point is that this man appeared and disappeared without much pomp or circumstance. In fact, it would have been more powerful if they had never revealed that Szpilman discovered who this man was. Of course, that might have been disrespectful.I have now seen all five Best Picture nominees from last year, and I would rank them as follows: 1) The Hours; 2) Gangs of New York; 3) The Pianist; 4) Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers; 5) Chicago. That I rank the actual winner last shouldn't raise eyebrows, because, to tell you the truth, I don't rank The Pianist and The Two Towers that much higher. The first two were original, intelligent, and challenging. The last three were much simpler, and it's no big surprise that they are more beloved. 8/10.","

"dbdumonteil","29 December 2005","In March 2003, Roman Polanski's ""the Pianist"" (2002) pocketed three Oscars including best actor (Adrien Brody) and best director (Roman Polanski). One month earlier, the ceremony of the French Oscars showered the movie with praise by attributing to it and his author similar prizes. Earlier in May 2002, the festival of Cannes crowned it of the most prestigious prize: the deservedly Golden Palm. Already in 2002 and chiefly throughout 2003, awards rained on Polanski's deeply moving piece of work and rightly so. It is a true return to form for him after an uneven career which started after the spooky ""the Tenant"" (1976) and wildly oscillated between duds (Pirates, 1986, Frantic, 1988) and palatable but not peerless works (Death and the Maiden, 1994, the Ninth Gate, 1999). ""The Pianist"" helped to rekindle the flame that made such treasures, hallmarks in their own domains (the wonderful ""Rosemary's Baby"", 1968 in the fantastic or the fabulous ""Chinatown"", 1974 in the film noir) and could be a stalwart success in the movie with the Second World War as the backdrop. It is perhaps Polanski's most personal film to date and the one he has always wanted to shot, surely to exorcise traumatic memories haunting him since his childhood. Like his main protagonist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, he experienced the horror of the ghetto of Warsaw.To get his demons out of his head, he preferred to adapt for the screen Spilzman's memories, a genius pianist and a man who bit by bit lost his family and friends on whom he could rely, a man who was deprived of his piano and thus of his ""raison d'être"". As Stefan Zweig says: ""to read is to live"", well for him ""to play is to live"". Even when he has the opportunity to play, he has to refrain himself. See the scene in which he has settled down to his flat. Before leaving him, the owner says to him: ""please, don't make noise"". Polanski makes us share his craving for playing by putting his main protagonist in front of the sacred instrument ans plays us the music in Spilzman's head without the latter touches the keys. He was also a man who saw sorrow, pain and the unthinkable (the sequences in which German officers and soldiers kill Jewish people give goose pimples because they're precisely unthinkable). Throughout his sufferings, chance didn't totally relinquish him: he was rescued at the last minute by a Polish policeman (and a fellow of his brother) who stopped him from going up in the train of death to Auschwitz. At this moment, he was saved from death but he lost his family. Then, he had to rely on his courage to survive and enjoyed the help of some fellows even if they absconded (the woman Spilzman made the acquaintance at the beginning of the film and her husband who found him a flat). At last, the German officer at the end of the film, was his ultimate glimmer of hope.Roman Polanski shot his film with a classic but startling directing for the sake of detail and realism. It has a linear but inevitable progression which has the look of a downward spiral: the tightening of the restrictions on Jewish people which become increasingly harsher (the armband to distinguish the Jewish from other peoples, then the delimitation and the encircling of the ghetto, the Jews chased away from their neighborhood and deported to the extermination camps) and the least sign of certainty is nearly automatically blighted: ""we have work certificates at last"" sighs Spilzman's father. Alas! Hopes blighted since just as he pronounces these words, a German officer asks them with other people to go outside. Some of them are killed while the others (including Spilzman's family) have to wait on a large square with thousands of others. Polanski also relates notable events with a minimum of means (the fight and shooting sequences are often perceived from a balcony or a window).The second part of the film strongly recalls Polanski's murkiest hours extracted from his masterworks. For example, in his flat, Spilzman tries to be as quiet as possible and while searching for food in his kitchen and drops crockery. The noise makes his neighbor intervene and by giving the alarm in the building obliges him to flee once again. At this moment, we find one of Polanski's trademarks: the eerie neighbor who has a harmful influence on the hero and contributes to his or her fall (the Castevet in ""Rosemary's Baby"", the offbeat inhabitants of the building in ""the Tenant"". In another extent, when Spilzman has to lurk in the destroyed ghetto (the distant shot where we can see him trudging in the ruins of this apocalyptic landscape deserves to rank among Polanski's most notable shots in all his filmography), Polanski really places us amid a ""in camera"" in spite of the sprawling scenery.The filmmaker should also be thanked for having chosen Adrien Brody in the main role. He works wonders in a part which seemed to be tailor-made for him, a far cry from his cardboard character in M Night Shyamalan's ""the Village"" (2004). He can act several persona in himself: a smart young man as well as a dirty and bearded tramp. His angular face, his acute and melancholic countenance stay with us for a long time. As for the German officers, they are often caricatured but ultimately Polanski eschews the trap of Manicheism which seemed to pervade the whole film thanks to the last sequences with the sympathetic German officer. Not all Nazis were beasts...Interspersed with either unbearable, either excruciating or either moving sequences and with striking shots, ""the Pianist"" has its place on the podium of Polanski's towering achievements. See it any costs! Unfortunately it would seem that the flame began to flicker again given the lukewarm critics ""Oliver Twist"" met this year. The slump again? Only time will tell...","

"Shilo_R_A","18 March 2023","The Pianist must be one of the most acclaimed and well-known depictions of the Holocaust in cinema, ever. Directed by Roman Polanski, it follows the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman - a Jewish pianist in Warsaw, Poland, just as the Nazi occupation begins there. It depicts the worsening state of him and his family through the Holocaust, and his struggle to survive throughout it.I can appreciate the sentiment of the film, showing how even well-known artists and people with status were stripped by the Nazi regime of their human rights, how things slowly escalated until even the artists couldn't think of art outside of dreams, maybe. How it all came down to surviving, and even the luckiest people that somehow managed to survived were deeply scarred by the horrible things they've seen. I'd say that Brody gives a very solid performance, and the film does manage to accomplish what it tries to do, in a way. The problem is, well, that it doesn't do much beyond that.There were scenes with shock value, sure, and thinking that everything we saw in the film is pretty close to how things went down can make one shiver all right. But the plot, especially in the second half of the film, didn't have much meat at all. The film crawled its way forward, the saturation goes down with each scene, but never did anything special to compensate for the slow, slow pacing and lack of interest I had in the main plot. The cinematography is okay, the dialogue is okay, the performances are okay. The moments that moved me were mostly that - moments - and mostly on the first half of the film. For a 2.5-hour film, it could've done more. Especially considering how widely acclaimed it is.So, if I had to sum it up, I'd say that I do appreciate certain things in the movie - the way it depicts the fall, the terror and the utter shock that Jewish artists have felt as they were torn apart from their seemingly-safe world, for instance. The shock value is definitely there in certain scenes, but the overall experience was pretty slow and lacking. I wasn't immersed, and I think that the film ends up feeling just...well, not bad, but not really good either. The first half is pretty good; the second half is mostly meh. I'm feeling something like a 6.3/10. Really wanted to like this more, but I guess it wasn't meant to be.","

"ma-cortes","18 November 2008","This is an emotionally tale and very decent drama about a pianist named Szpilman from luxurious life until terrible ending in the Warsaw ghetto. Polanski correctly directs a spellbinding portrait about the holocaust with his personal knowledge and proper experience on his childhood . Adrien Brody is excellent in a complicate and suffering role. Besides splendid actors, Frank Finlay,Jessica Meyer, Emilia Fox and Thomas Kretschman as a good Nazi officer who helps him. Evocative cinematography by cameraman Pawel Edlman, Polanski's usual. Musical score by Wojciech Kilar with brilliant piano sounds. Academy Award for best director Roman Polanski, Actor, Adrien Brody and adapted script by Ronald Harwood based on Wladyslaw Szpilman memories.Adding more details over largely described on the movie referred 'the Warsaw ghetto uprising', the events happened on the following manner : In 1939, after the invasion of Poland, Reinhard Heydrich chief of Gestapo began to place all Polish Jews in ghettos, where they could slowly die of hunger and disease. The campaign was to be administered by the Waffen-SS the party's military formations that fought as integral units in the armed forces. The Warsaw ghetto was the largest of these segregated areas established by the Nazis in Poland. In 1940 Heydrich, using the excuse that the spread of typhus had to be contained, set up a special section 11 miles in circumference enclosed by a brick wall 10 feet high. The cost was paid by the Judenrat, the Jewish Council of twenty-four-members, which was in charge of Jewish affairs inside the ghetto. In 1940 more than 80.000 gentile Poles living in the infected area were ordered to leave, and the next month about 140,000 living elsewhere in the city were moved in which the 240,000 still live in the ghetto. Some 360.000 Jews, a third of Warsaw's population, were herded into a 3,5-square-mile area. Meanwhile, Gestapo agents removed all Jews from the economic and cultural life of the city, from factories,shops, theaters, and libraries. On November 15,1940, the ghetto was sealed and its twenty-two entrances closed. No one was allowed to leave or enter, there was to be contact with the outside world.The situation soon became critical,Jews fought for jobs in the ghetto, including work with the labor battalions organized by the Nazis. Those unable to find work tried to exist by selling jewels,clothing, or anything else to obtain food. From 300 to 400 died daily in the Warsaw trap. More than 43.000 starved to death during the first year. Children crazed by hunger crawled through the sewers to the non-Jewish sectors of the city to smuggle in a bit of food. People were no longer moved by the sight of men and women falling dead on the streets. The Nazi authorities began intensified measure on July 22, 1942. As a memorial to Heydrich, Heirich Himmler ordered all Jews except those already in concentration camps to be deported .The ghetto and all labor camps would then be destroyed. Mass deportations to the gas chambers of Treblinka began. In two months 300.000 Jews were eliminated. The Judenrat was ordered to deliver 6.000 Jews daily for deportation. Each day thousands were driven by guards through the gates.Young Zionists, pioneers training to go to Palestine, mobilized first to be followed by members of the Polish workers party . On July 28, 1942, the Jewish Combat organization consisting about 1.000 men and boys was formed. All resolved to kill as many of their tormentors as they could before they died.The Jews fighting from rooftops, cellars, and attics,Poles outside the ghetto now began to send in more revolvers, grenades, and dynamite. In 1943 the guerrillas divided into twenty-two groups built an intricate network underground cellars and tunnels ,linked with command posts . In April 19,1943 German troops moved in on the ghetto to send all who were left to Treblinka in a final action. First came the armed trucks, tanks, and armored cars. The ghetto fighters poured a hail of bullets, grenades and bombs, the fighting went on for twenty-eight days. The guerrillas fought to the last. Many committed suicide at the moment before capture. The Germans dragged survivors from the cellars and rubble. Fewer than 100 escaped, the last 60000 Jews had been exterminated or killed in the explosions and fires.Polish sources reported that the fighters had killed 300 Germans and wounded 1000. From Warsaw Jewish resistance moved to swamps and forests.","

"Buddy-51","14 June 2003","`The Pianist' is a bit like `Schindler's List' as seen from the inside out.  The one flaw in that earlier film always seemed to be that, by choosing to make a Gentile  Oskar Schindler - the protagonist in his film, Spielberg turned the Jews themselves almost into background players in their own story.  That doesn't happen with `The Pianist' since the hero in this case happens to be himself a Jew  the real life Polish pianist and composer Wladyslaw Szpilman - who managed, through strength, determination and the assistance of a number of brave and caring individuals, to survive the horrors of that darkest and most inexplicable chapter in 20th Century history.This is not to say that `The Pianist' is a better film than `Schindler's List'  far from it.  For while this latest work from Roman Polanski is a fascinating tale of survival in its own right, the film lacks the moral and psychological resonance that made Spielberg's work such a universally acclaimed masterpiece.  Because Schindler was an outsider looking in, he was forced to make the kind of moral choices that Szpilman never really faces in the situations in which he finds himself.  In fact, the one time that the protagonist is confronted with such an option  having to decide whether or not to betray his people by joining the Jewish police whose job it is maintain order in the Warsaw ghetto  Szpilman flat out declines the offer. This may, indeed, be the way circumstances played themselves out in real life, but this elimination of any kind of psychological depth makes `The Pianist' seem frustratingly superficial at times.Although the film isn't as rich and powerful as it might have been, `The Pianist' is still exceptional on a lot of different levels.  First of all, Polanski and his screenwriter, Ronald Hardwood, both of whom won Oscars for their work here, capture the brutality and sadism of the Nazi regime with frightening candor and almost `reportorial' objectivity.  As in `Schindler's List,' people in this film die in very believable, very graphic ways. Particularly interesting are the early sections of the film in which we witness the gradual steps leading up to the eventual deportation and extermination of the Warsaw Jews, beginning with the curtailment of Jewish civil rights, then to the branding of them with stars of David on their clothing, then to their imprisonment in the Warsaw ghetto, and, finally, to the inexorable walk to the gas chamber.  `The Pianist' doesn't take us that far on screen, but we sure sense the presence of those death camps in the loss of Szpilman's entire family.  `The Pianist' brilliantly recreates this shameful era in recent human history and does so without becoming sentimental and pretentious in the process.  Adrian Brody won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance here, and he is very good indeed, especially given the fact that the role calls for him to be more of a reactor to the events around him than a catalyst.  Polanski and Hardwood have provided this fine young actor with a veritable tour de force assignment that he executes with a great deal of skill and aplomb. Unfortunately, a number of the other characters - particularly those who go out of their way to help him - remain stubbornly enigmatic throughout.`The Pianist' is an honorable addition to the list of fine films that have attempted to come to grips with the subject of the holocaust.  But, for my money, the best still remains `The Shop on Main Street,' the Oscar-winning Best Foreign Language film of 1965.  This superb Czech film does what `The Pianist' is never quite able to do, which is to find a way to involve us in the momentous moral dilemmas that undoubtedly faced many of the people involved in this life-and-death event.  `The Pianist,' by making its tale strictly a story of survival and not a study of human psychology, fails to illuminate much of what we really need to know about that time. And about ourselves.","

"sddavis63","4 November 2009","The first thing that should be said is that this is most definitely more than a Holocaust movie. Although that dreadful event stands firmly in the background, this movie is really about one man's struggle for survival. The one man is Polish Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Adrien Brody played that lead role, and he played it well. Szpilman comes across as both pitiful in his desperation to survive but at the same time as noble in his desperation to survive. Brody portrays him as a man with great dignity. It was a challenging role, because as the movie progresses, there's less and less dialogue for the simple reason that almost everyone except Szpilman has been taken by the Nazis. Brody ends up playing long stretches without voice, but it doesn't stop him from rendering a brilliant portrait of the man, whose friends and family are gone and who simply tries to live day by day hoping for a way out of this madness. Just as haunting are extended scenes in which director Roman Polanski simply shows us a devastated Warsaw - not just the Jewish ghetto, but other parts of the city as well. The scenes of rubble, the scenes of innocent people being gunned down in the street by German soldiers - sometimes just for sport, without any other obvious reason, the scenes of burned out buildings. It's all haunting.For all that - and all that was very good - there was something about the story that didn't really click with me. For some strange reason I found it difficult to follow and I did think that at almost two and a half hours it was a little bit too long. As much as was accomplished in that running time could have been accomplished in two hours flat. It's a good movie, but just failed to reach the level of greatness that some have assigned to it. 6/10","

"johnharapa","23 October 2021","Some reviews I've read here, have found this movie too detached, lacking urgency. I believe, that impassive quality reflects exactly what Polanski wants to say this extraordinary jewel.By showing Wladyslaw Szpilman as a survivor but not a fighter or a hero--as a man who does all he can to save himself, but would have died without enormous good luck and some kindness from a few non-Jews--Polanski is reflecting, I believe, his own deepest feelings: that he survived, but need not have, and that his mother died and left a wound that had never properly healed.Adrian Brody's performance was utterly mesmerising. I doubt that we'll see him act like that - EVER.Little wonder he was awarded Best Male Actor at the Oscars.Polanski too was awarded Best Director - ironic Brody was the youngest recipient of an Oscar and Polanski was the oldest until Clint Eastwood won it several years later.","

"ACollegeStudent","17 May 2023","Rating: 7.0The movie was ok, it put you in the shoes of a Jewish pianist surviving the German occupation. Honestly, it's boring in stretches since we already know the pianist survives therefore it has no stakes. Due to this and a subject matter has been done to death it personally didn't move me. The side characters weren't compelling or interesting, and the pianist himself is just a guy on the run who can play the piano, no other notable traits besides that. Because the subject matter is overdone and we already know how it ends it needs a lot more to keep it engaging which this doesn't have. Granted this is a biography so can't deviate too much or else it loses accuracy.","

"Derek237","30 March 2003","The Pianist is not a movie made for entertainment. It's either more or less than that and only the viewer can decide. You have to ask yourself sometimes if the main reason films about the holocaust are so popular is because of shock appeal. If a movie depicts these terrifying events well, does that make it a good movie? The Pianist has many scenes showing the Nazi's brutality that feel almost voyeuristic. Some scenes show Adrien Brody's character looking out the window at these terrible things and you feel as if you're looking out a window, too.I hope shock appeal isn't the reason this film is liked so much, though. Because this is an amazing story about the will to survive. Music is the character's passion,and throughout his struggles he can only fantasize about playing piano. There is one scene near the end in which he finally gets the opportunity. What follows is a touching moment that transitions from rusty skills warming up to an intense and passionate display of artistic talent. In this moment there is no longer a war going on, no longer the agony of hunger or memories of lost loved ones, just beautiful music. His reputation as a musician and his desire to go on to play again is essentially what keeps him alive. And who says art isn't important?Adrien Brody is very good in this. Well obviously he is, he just won the Best Actor Oscar. I think he can be compared to Tom Hanks in Cast Away- even in scenes of silence there's just something about the actor's movements and expressions that keeps you engaged.There's another scene near the end that defines the entire performance, the entire movie for me: After all the trouble Brody went through trying to survive, he is almost killed by the people who would save him. He is wearing a coat that a German officer had given him earlier, and when Russian troops spotted Brody they thought he was German. They shot at him and almost killed him, but they finally found out he was Polish. An officer asks him, ""Why the f-cking coat?"" Brody, with his hands still in the air, a terrified look on his face, almost crying, replies: ""I'm cold."" That did it for me.The Pianist is certainly a shocking and even depressing film, but like most movies that aspire to provoke thoughts and emotions, the audience takes out of it what they bring in to it. Surely Szpiellman wasn't just a lucky bastard who survived in times of inhumane brutality. It was through the kindness and compassion of others who helped him, if only because they found themselves inexplicably moved by his music.My rating: 10/10","

"evanston_dad","4 August 2010","Before seeing ""The Pianist,"" I thought there couldn't possibly be a movie about the Holocaust that could tell me something I didn't already know, or make me feel an emotion I haven't already felt a hundred times before about the topic. But director Roman Polanski proved me wrong.There's a scene in ""The Pianist"" in which Nazis invade a Jewish apartment building and ""clean out"" its tenants. They pick up an elderly man confined to a wheelchair, carry the chair to the edge of the balcony, and casually tip him over the edge to fall to his death on the pavement below. The moment shocked me in a way that nothing in Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" did, I think precisely because, unlike Spielberg, Polanski isn't interested in manipulating his audience into feeling something. The strength of his movies has always been that they unfold with a detached, objective point of view and let audiences draw their own conclusions. The scene described above is so shocking because Polanski does nothing to embellish it and therefore never draws attention to the fact that you're watching a movie.The rest of the film is like that -- it's harrowing and unpleasant at times, but it also rewards the viewer by saying something about a historical event when I didn't think there was anything left to say.Grade: A","

"tedg","21 April 2003","Spoilers herein.Nearly any film is for me a double experience: the watching and the post-coital rumination. That second phase can make the experience worthwhile even when the film itself is ordinary or poorly done.But it works the other way as well, especially when a film is designed for discussion: the film delivered with so many opinions that themselves are ordinary or poorly done. This film comes so charged. Szpilman wasn't `Jewish enough' to be the center of an important holocaust film, goes the most ordinary and loudest of them. I suppose there are some things about the commingling of descriptive art and definitive life to be said there. But one likes to have more freedom in post-film thoughts and that whole topic is dominated by the sorts of reflexive responses manipulated by film.There's a second prepackaged topic concerning whether `Schindler' was better or `worse.' I don't consider Spielberg's film a holocaust film at all: he lives in a happy world, where justice and right (and lots of other happy values) always triumph. His observations are always external. His goal is always to tell a story, a stance that furthers the distance between his films and reality. Polanski's project has no story at all, merely a life of accidents. His camera is within the artist's personal space. His own mannerisms are Eastern European and depressed, congruent with what he shows. (Speilberg's Schindler really did have the silk unctuousness of the East, but as observed from California.) So I credit Polanski's vision as having more historical credibility than Speilberg's, knowing that despite the best efforts of us all to avoid having practical history made by the movie marketplace.(One exception, where Polanksi is offensively theatrical: when Szpliman runs from the destroyed hospital, he faces a street of desolation as far as one can see, `High Noon'-wise.)Much more interesting to my mind is the portrayal of an artist. Polanski has always been deeply self-referential in his work: always there is an examination of the artist within the art. And I make a minor hobby out of collecting film experiences that do this with music and mathematics because I have some personal experience to work with. For those who don't know: Polands pride is Chopin, who invented a relationship to the piano that not only defined modernity but reinvented everything about musical performance. (Film would follow this lead in 1941.) Chopin built pieces designed to be bent in performance, designed with empty rooms that a pianist could explore. Unlike, Bach for instance, where the magic of the performance was in attuning to Bach and his intent, the performer of Chopin really could bring his own soul to parity with God. Szpliman was a strong pianist, and therefore more than a national character, instead a reflection of the Polish heart.Here, we  watch this man compromise his own pride, eschew his religion, run away from every opportunity for dignity in order to keep his hands warm to play another day; and not just play, but play on the radio for Poles. So during this painful journey, we assume what we are meant to in films about tortured artists: that the pain we are watching will be transmuted by this man into great art that will lift us all. His own personal denigration - what is done to him and the denigrating choices he makes - are worth it overall.This is where the fatal pessimism of Polanski stops, because he doesn't let us know the musical truth. This is not Szpilmans playing of course, but not much unlike him. Szpilman was a `safe' player, one who never had the strength or desire to add much to Chopin. That's why he was on the radio: his `interpretations' were unchallenging and palatable. But he would never have been considered an artist of note at all if he had not survived the perfect brutality of the Germans, whose own music, though sentimental was constrained in ways that Chopin's never was. The payoff is supposed to be that after his trials, the artist is now - theoretically - capable of expressing the pain and yearning of the world. That we are meant to so think is clear from the end, where he plays with the glow of Dreyfuss from `Music of the Heart.'Ah, but not so. The sound we actually hear throughout is by Olejniczak, a similarly ordinary man. Szpilman did not in fact come through a better artist, but much worse: a meek pianist. `Shellshocked,' postwar contemporaries would say. Contrast this with Artur Rubinstein. Jewish Pole of the previous generation, and the first giant to explore Chopin's rubato. He had his own dark nights, but not because the world was inhospitable. Listen to his recordings (freely available) compared to Szpilmans (hard to get) or even Olejniczaks on the soundtrack. These are two different universes. One is merely pleasant, the other life-altering.Polanski has made some great films (including the under-appreciated `Ninth Gate'), and his thinking through of the intellectual reach of a project is extensive but he has ultimately let us down here. Implicit in much of modern Jewishness is the triumph of enrichment of the people through their tribulation. Perhaps that is true, but this film undermines the idea when selecting Szpilman as metaphor.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.","

"gavin6942","19 May 2010","I don't have much to say on this movie, other than that it was very good. Adrien Brody is a fine actor and this is probably his finest role (though I'm partial to ""The Jacket"").My only real concern with this film ,and it shouldn't be seen as a slight against it, is that it seems that making a film about the Holocaust makes a film automatically better. I'm not sure if it's because it evokes emotions or what, but this film, ""Schindler's List"" and others quickly rise to the top of the list of good films... World War II in general seems to do this, but the Holocaust even more so. It's an odd phenomenon.","

"9902439Claessens","1 October 2002","last weekend, I saw Roman Polanski's The Pianist and what a movie. The grizzly reality feeling of the movie shell-shocked me in the first place but later on I recognized the pure feeling of the film: The horror what war does with innocent people truly is. the main story isn't about a war hero, but about people who don't want to die in this madness. Every aspect of the film is really done for an reason and in his place and you don't feel this as entertainment.the music is what hit me the most. the classical tunes had such an enormous impact on me and portrayed the feelings of the main role of the pianist. The fact that there are no hero's in a war movie is for me more than a welcome benefit. No war in the world should have hero's who can't die. Everybody in this movie can die, every second of it. The scary moments are real scary.
bottom line: ten times as realistic as the also brilliant Schindler's list. and twenty times better than Saving private Ryan for the lack of hero's and there is no patriotism at all.ten out of ten, best movie of 2002","

"Poseidon-3","19 January 2004","Far from the first motion picture to deal with the Holocaust and unlikely to be the last, this is nevertheless a stunning piece of film.  Brody portrays the title character (based on an actual person) who plays piano on Polish radio until the Nazi invasion of his country makes it impossible to continue.  Through his eyes, the audience witnesses the continual, seemingly-unstoppable dehumanization of Brody and his family and the virtual destruction of Poland.  The journey that this character takes, undoubtedly enhanced by director Polanski's own recollection of his early life, is almost incomprehensible.  Since so many films have been released on this subject, one can't help noticing the similarity to other movies and the familiarity of the situations depicted in the opening scenes.  However, the utter craftsmanship of this film and the casting (nothing short of perfection down the very last role) set this apart until the story's uniqueness kicks in.  Brody is nothing short of magnificent.  His face reflects (naturally and without mugging) the soulfulness, humiliation and deprivation of his character.  Polanski does a superb job of recreating the world of WWII Poland.  Every detail of the film is exact and mesmerizing (helped greatly by casting non-name actors who inhabit their roles with great feeling and authenticity.  There is no opportunity to play ""spot the star"" except for the most seasoned filmgoer.)  What happens to Brody is so startlingly, stunningly jaw-dropping it seems surreal at times.  Amazingly, Polanski is able to occasionally inject the faintest touches of black humor and irony to this, which makes for some very intriguing viewing.  That is not to say that the film is easy to watch.  Already a master (for decades) of creating feelings of unease, paranoia and fear in the viewer, Polanski sets into motion a film in which the audience can hardly breathe for fear that their own noise will result in the discovery of the frequently hidden Brody.  The film is notable for making sounds such as marching boots, idling cars and faraway voices seem more terrifying than anything Hollywood has ever had to offer in all of its multitudinous thrillers and horror films. If there are any faults in the film, they are few.  Perhaps some of Brody's experiences seem repetitive at times and the depiction of Germans sometimes approaches caricature.  However, all is forgiven as the story reaches its heart-stopping moment when Brody is attempting to open an all-important can of food.  Here the film reaches brilliance.  Clearly, the film is not going to appeal to the shallow or the disinterested, but to those who have a fondness for striking, deeply-felt and lovingly-told stories, this one is hard to top.","

"Close_The_Door","25 January 2006","I knew Roman Polanski's talent but was not prepared to this descent to Hell, described in painstaking detail. I'm physically upset after watching this film. The sense of disgust is real. How awful. How awful.I could not help identifying myself with the Jewish Poles in Varsovia. I couldn't help thinking that the paralytic old man thrown down the window could be my grandfather. Couldn't help thinking that the kid savagely pulled through the wall could be my brother. Couldn't help thinking that the girl asking the SS-guard the wrong question and being killed just for that, could be myself.The film describes beastly destruction of any dignity, and yet the struggle for surviving despite everything, even if rationally you realise that, perhaps, it would be even better to end it all at once. It describes the dishonesty of people profiting of this situation to make business out of your misery. It describes your need of believing the words of men NOT of their word, if they promise you life. And affection and courage surviving despite all this.This film could make a good pair with ""der Untergang"" with Bruno Ganz, which is also such a masterpiece that you may risk feeling sympathetic with the Nazi. Have you had this temptation? Watch ""The Pianist"".","

"Theo Robertson","20 September 2009","The problem with making a holocaust film is that it's a subject that's been done before . Everyone from Steven Spielberg to ( Amazingly and somewhat hypocritically I say ) Vanessa Redgrave has made a film centering around the Nazi attempt to exterminate European Jewry . I have a problem with this because it denigrates history to an extent . If people have to make a film featuring man's inhumanity to man as a reminder what does this say for the rest of humanity ? Can't the rest of humanity watch a documentary like SHOA or the Genocide episode of THE WORLD AT WAR ( My first introduction to The Holocaust ) or read a book of the accounts of Nazi mass murder ? Would it be too cynical to point out how well rewarded Holocaust movies are ? It's also noticeable how formulaic these type of movies are . We start at the beginning of the war and follow the protagonist's survival until they're liberated by the allies in 1945 That said THE PIANIST does have merits of its own even though it doesn't really bring much to the table originality wise . Actually the food allegory is appropriate though slightly confusing . Early in the film we see the terrible conditions in the Warsaw ghetto as its Jewish population are effectively walled up from the rest of the city and left to die . Cut to a restaurant interior as Wladyslaw Szpilman entertains the guests by playing the piano as the patrons grow fat by gorging themselves on food , fine wine and cigarettes as their fellow Jews fall dead in the streets . With a little editing you might find yourself thinking this part was directed by David Irving instead of Roman Polanski ! One thing THE PIANIST does do well is include the apocryphal tale of the Jews discussing their fate at the hands of the Nazis with no one wanting to believe for a second that the lone voice stating the Nazis are deporting them to be murdered may in fact be talking the truth no matter how unbelievable and horrific the truth may be Like I AM LEGEND the story suffers from the fact that the protagonist has no one to speak to for large portions of the narrative but there's so much incident on screen such as the Warsaw uprising it's not a major problem . You could make the point that Szpliman then becomes a spectator to Polish history rather than a character in his own right and you'd possibly be correct but these scenes are very well choreographed and filmed that it shouldn't be made as a criticism . There's also the introduction of "" A good German "" that we've seen before in films such as MUTTER'S COURAGE but Hosenfeld is so well drawn and acted by Thomas Kretschmann it's very difficult not to feel sorry for his fate In truth THE PIANIST follows the usual structure of holocaust movies but unlike some movies of this particular genre certainly deserved much of the critical acclaim hoisted upon it . As can be expected it's not a feel good movie but is definitely a well made and acted story of human suffering and endurance","

"Doylenf","11 June 2003","Words are inadequate to describe the flawless flow of events in this absorbing account of Polish Jews facing extinction in the Warsaw Ghetto of the '40s during the Nazi reign of terror.Surely the most deserving Oscar award in years was bestowed on Adrien Brody who captures his character completely and carries the film with his amazingly real performance. He is at the center of vision throughout most of the action--so perfect in his role that he makes the story an unforgettable experience. His confrontation with a Nazi officer who discovers his hiding place and then asks him to prove that he is a pianist by playing the piano, is just one of the memorable highlights. This scene alone was justification for Brody's Oscar.Roman Polanski's direction is masterful throughout, never allowing the story to bog down in sentimentality but keeping the focus on survival and some of the horrific things that happen along the way.An inspired piece of filmmaking that is stunning to watch because it is so real and moving. Not since SCHINDLER'S LIST has the brutality and epic sweep of World War II been captured so accurately.","

"ElMaruecan82","1 June 2012","To think that I avoided ""The Pianist"" for about 10 years because I expected a new ""Schindler's List""! And I don't even mean that negatively.I've watched Spielberg's film several times and know too well how painful Holocaust movies are, and while ""Life is Beautiful"" was a tragicomic fable and ""Sophie's Choice"" more of a character study relating a traumatic experience, I knew ""The Pianist"" would be on the same level of ambition and seriousness than Spielberg's film, if only because it was directed by Roman Polanski, a Holocaust survivor himself. I knew the movie would feature shocking arbitrary executions and poignant separations, so in a way, ""The Pianist"" was already having an impact on me without watching it. But this is not the only reason why I didn't feel the urge to watch it.Part of the blame is to be put on the film itself although it was inevitably going to be compared with its 'glorious' predecessor. Speaking of my own experience, I was mislead by ""The Pianist"" and the movie trailers. I thought it was the story of a man who played music for the Nazis and his survival, and therefore found in the present's horror and gloominess a heaven of escapism in the inner, universal and timeless beauty of music. Wladislaw would have the state of mind of one of Schindler's factory workers with music as the same weapon as Guido's humor and optimism in ""Life is Beautiful"". Of course, I realize now how my preconceived ideas totally underestimated Roman Polanski and I hope this review redeems my 10 years of abstinence.First, one must give to Spielberg what is Spielberg's and to Polanski what is Polanski's. ""Schindler's List"" is a better directed film but ""The Pianist"" is a better told story. And while the directing of Spielberg betrays sometimes the harshness of its subject by too much 'mise en scene', Polanski's ability to hook our hearts to the fate of Wladislaw Spillman, magnificently portrayed by Adrien Brody, and his family is beyond words. Indeed, we feel like part of this family. While the epic scope of ""Schindler's List"" provided a sort of moral aura to the victims, making the film a martyrdom's remembrance, ""The Pianist"" is simply the chronicles of a banal horror. And Polanski keeps an intimate, almost unnoticeable directing, to better convey the feeling that we're watching normal people whose lives are dramatically affected by an absurd War, and it's their very normality that emphasizes the cruelty of the Nazi treatment.The film opens in Warsaw in September 1939 so those with a minimum of historical knowledge understand the implication. Wladislaw is playing Chopin in a studio when the first German bombings are heard, his family wants to leave but later, they learn in the radio that France and Britain entered the War. Relieved, they celebrate the news with a toast, and the relatively cheerful ambiance contrasts with the usual demonstrations of grief and pain. Of course, we know the worst is to come, but Polanski takes his time to get us immersed in the war's ambiance and letting us observe the progressive decline of the Spillmans, directly mirroring the atmosphere that probably prevailed within all the Jewish families.Through the Spillman's perspectives, we get a more accurate idea of the nightmare endured by Polish Jews. When they're all parked in the Warsaw ghetto, before the inevitable evacuation, we witness gut-wrenching, intolerable, and acts of brutality, so unbelievably gratuitous and horrific, we never doubt that they're based on true stories, and that war, definitely, inspires the worst from humanity. In war, there's no room for dignity, for charity, for understanding, for God I would even say. As for violence, there is no scale, soldiers throwing off a balcony an old grandfather on a wheelchair because he couldn't stand is a horrifying sight, but maybe I expected these kind of moments so much that I was more shocked by the part where the soldiers made people dance together. Sometimes, humiliations are more impacting than random and arbitrary killings.And again, the talent of Polanski is precisely not to have overplayed on the directing department: no 'Black and White', no special effects, no 'little girl in Red', just basic colors, as to sustain the feeling of a present, more real then more horrific. ""Schindler's List"" might be a better film for some, but it's still a film, while ""The Pianist"" is a survival story, raw and real. Not a hero, not a victim either, the main protagonist will sometimes count on his courage, sometimes on his good luck, sometimes on the help of good-hearted and understanding people, from any sides. There is a light of hope in the film, through music, at a time where humanity reached its lowest point, music was here to remind people, to remind Nazis what a waste the War was, a feeling incarnated by Adrien Brody's sad-looking eyes.Again, don't expect a hero à la Oskar Schindler in Wladislaw, ""The Pianist"" shows the boldness of a period where cowardice was sometimes guided by survival instinct, where the desire to live could be more necessary than the desire to fight, because surviving left more voices to speak about the atrocities. ""The Pianist"" reveals those hidden subtleties that couldn't be truly expressed in epic movies. Some Jews didn't fight back precisely because the horrors of Auschwitz, Treblinka, Buchenwald had to be known, and ironically, this was one of the reasons that accelerated the exterminations' process. And some like Wladislaw had to hide not to make the sacrifices of the others unnecessary, those were tough times and no one is allowed to put a judgment... not us, anyway.And this is why ""The Pianist"" is more affecting than ""Schindler's List"", and if one has any doubt, let's not forget, that Spielberg was born in 1946 while Roman Polanski is still a war survivor who lost his mother in a Death Camp.","

"Steffi_P","5 April 2012","The Pianist is a movie that often gets bundled together with Schindler's List as being ""about"" the holocaust. But this is a misunderstanding, a simplification even, of this picture (and of Schindler's List). It relates to the holocaust, but it is not the story of the holocaust – it's the story of one man. Władisław Szpilman was an artist, with great talent in his hands and his mind, and in him is represented something very precious in humanity. He also appears, as many such people really are, someone to whom the music mattered far more than current affairs. As such, he provides a unusual view on atrocity, that of someone who, rather than actively fight against it, for the most part tried simply to exist in spite of it.This somewhat passive yet dignified stance is ably reflected in Roman Polanski's direction, which has always been characterised by an excruciating intimacy with his subjects and a certain detachment from the world in which they inhabit. Here we see Szpilman glimpsing the war through windows and doorways, yet often himself or his hands in close-up. But Polanski's boldest strokes of genius are in his creation and presentation of the ghetto and its inhabitants, especially as regards how he draws our attention. The soldiers giving a cigarette to an elderly Jewish man and the couple fighting over a can of stew are foregrounded. Seconds later, a corpse lies innocuously in the background. When Władek's father is accosted by two Germans, we see a couple of Polish women hastily get out of the way. When the shot changes to reveal the officer's back, the focus is suddenly on his gun holster – it draws our attention to things that give a little extra breadth and context to a scene.Central to The Pianist is Adrien Brody's portrayal of the title character. It's an incredibly sedate performance, with everything below the surface, utterly commanding of our attention despite its understatement. His emotions seem muted – when reunited with a friend the merest ghost of a smile plays across his lips, but by now we know the character and understand that this is a deep and sincere expression. Brody virtually carries the movie alone, and one of the unfortunate things about The Pianist is that not one other performance stands out at all, and the inadequacy of some of the supporting players does hurt the earlier scenes a little.But perhaps the greatest thing about The Pianist is in the fine construction of its story. Although most of it is based incredibly faithfully on Szpilman's own memoir, the adaptation by Ronald Harwood gives it a certain dramatic course. There is one intensely poignant scene, and one of the few entirely fictionalised episodes, in which Szpilman is being sheltered by Dorota, wakes to the sound of her cello-playing and, just for a moment, he can imagine what life would be like if she had been his wife. Finally, the scene where Hosenfeld asks Szpilman to play for him seems to be the key to the whole thing. It's as if every moment, every narrative line, points towards that scene. We've seen Germans forcing Jews to dance for their entertainment, which makes us first question Hosenfeld's motives. We've seen Szpilman's desperation to be reunited with a piano, his fingers making keystrokes in the air. In retrospect, this all seems a set-up for that encounter. In effect, The Pianist becomes a tale of a harrowing time, filtered through the beauty of a musical performance.","

"dbborroughs","7 August 2005","I don't know what to say about this move other than it really didn't movie me. Sure Adrian Brody is excellent as the Pianist of the title who hides out in Warsaw as the city is destroyed around him, but I never really connected to the story. I never really cared. I'm not sure if its poor film making or simply the fact that for me this seemed as been there and done that. Many of the things that I dislike in the well financed movies concerning the Holocaust came into play, in particular the fact that everything looks so nice as to be unreal. I also have the sense that the film is insisting that I like and respect it simply because of the subject matter. Its not that simple you have to give me characters and a good story before I care. Unfortunately while Brody is an excellent actor however I never connected to him. I never had a reason to care other than what happened was truly remarkable, which means this movie meant nothing to me. This film is a major disappointment","

Having already seen the film once I wanted to watch again so I felt like I was in a much better head space for the trip.Adrien Brody is a great fit for this part. And his lack of speech in the whole films shows just how horrifying the actions of the Germans to the Jewish community were.We are fully on this journey with him, and it's heartbreaking the journey he goes on, especially having to leave his family to go to their death on the train to treblinka.The scene where the German SS throw the wheelchair bound man out the window always sticks with me.I can't believe he went through all that to nearly get killed by his own men mistaking him for a German!It's a shame Szpilman wasn't able to repay Hosenfeld his kindness, but maybe that is karma after all!","

"tfrizzell","11 April 2003","Haunting adaptation based on the life of Polish Jew Wladyslaw Szpilman (portrayed by surprise Oscar-winner Adrien Brody), a somewhat sheltered young man who just takes life as it comes to him and of course has an uncanny knack for playing the piano. Timing is bad though for the titled character as the Nazi occupation of Poland is imminent and exile to death camps is a definite possibility. Brody and his family (parents Maureen Lipman and Frank Finley and siblings Ed Stoppard, Jessica Kate Meyer and Julia Rayner) quickly realize that things are going from bad to worse as life starts to spin out of control. Instructions in the newspaper foreshadow future hardships as the Star of David patches are demanded of all Jewish peoples to wear and then the dreaded ghettos follow. The film then becomes heart-wrenching, but a change occurs that allows Brody to be spared from the death camps. Now he must try to avoid the Nazi Regime and find an unbending will to survive against all odds. Help does come from fellow Jews and non-Nazi Germans. Emilia Fox makes a lasting impression as a woman that Brody falls in love with early on and then shows up again later in an important part. Thomas Kretschmann also stands out as a Nazi officer who has a change of heart during the film's latter moments (he is also linked to Brody because of his love for the piano). ""The Pianist"" is a film that fashions itself after Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". This production is better in spots than the earlier movie, but as a whole it is not quite as impressive. ""The Pianist"" has a more exact focus and ends up being more of a one-man showcase for Brody in its second half. ""Cast Away"" meets the Holocaust would probably be the way to describe ""The Pianist"" when all is said and done. A brilliant adapted screenplay by Oscar-winner Ronald Harwood brings the novel to life. Roman Polanski finally struck Oscar gold for his unbelievable direction here (his work is on par with Scorsese's in ""Gangs of New York"" for the most part). He quietly became the oldest winner ever in the Academy's history in that particular category. All the supporters have well-calculated parts, but Brody's character is the most dominant of course. However, Brody never does reach the level of Liam Neeson in ""Schindler's List"" or even past Oscar-winner Roberto Benigni in ""Life Is Beautiful"". In fact his character is not near as complicated as the film would like. He is trying to survive and his motivation is life. A case can be made quite easily for either Daniel Day-Lewis in ""Gangs of New York"" or Jack Nicholson in ""About Schmidt"" to have taken home the Best Actor Oscar instead, but that is in the past now (it is better not to go into Brody's acceptance speech at all). Also Brody did very little playing of the piano himself (he had a double for the much more difficult pieces) which pales him to past Oscar winners like Holly Hunter (""The Piano"") and Geoffrey Rush (""Shine""). Overall I do think ""The Pianist"" is an excellent film. I do think it is one of the stronger screenplay- and direction-driven films of recent memory. Polanski ends up being the real star here and it is his vision, tone, ability and film-making skill that does make ""The Pianist"" one of the best movies of 2002. 5 stars out of 5.","

"CinemaClown","1 May 2011","Helmed by a Holocaust survivor himself yet presenting an objective take on the disturbing subject matter, The Pianist is the most personal film renowned director Roman Polanski has made in his decades-spanning career for it is crafted with meticulous care n attention, told with immaculate simplicity & also happens to feature one of cinema's most extraordinary performances.Based on the memoir of the same name & set in Warsaw during the Second World War, The Pianist tells the story of Władysław Szpilman; a Polish-Jewish musician who after avoiding deportation to Nazi labour camps tries to elude capture by living in the ruins of his city. The plot details his miraculous survival against all odds which wouldn't have happened without the kindness of few compassionate humans.Directed by Roman Polanski, The Pianist does bring back the horrors of the Holocaust and never shies away from depicting the barbaric treatment millions of Jews underwent during Nazi occupation. But it's not a tale about someone who caused an uprising or put his life on the line to save others but through one person, it tries to capture what most people under same circumstances were trying to do: survive, no matter what it takes.Polanski does manage to infuse his own history into the story but never lets that distract his own vision for the picture at hand, and there in lies the true beauty of this survival story. It's arguably the finest film that he's made & certainly the most artistic. Adding more strength to the feature is the brilliantly-written screenplay that keeps the focus on our protagonist at all times & resonates the brutality that millions underwent through his own life story.Coming to the technical aspects, every single element only ends up enhancing the entire experience. Production Design team does a superb job in recreating the war-torn city & set pieces are refined to smallest of details. Cinematography makes impeccable use of camera in capturing every frame plus the cold colour temperature encapsulates the whole film with a bleak mood. Editing paces its 149 minutes of runtime with precision. And classical music is beautifully incorporated into the narrative.Another thing that seals the destiny of The Pianist is the exceptional performance by Adrien Brody in the role of Władysław Szpilman that simply exceeded every expectation. Perfectly capturing not just the feeling of hopelessness, loneliness, grief & living under constant fear but also the desperation, survival instinct & passion for music, what Brody delivers here is one of cinema's most memorable performances that still ranks as his best and his Academy Award win for this role was deserving in every manner.On an overall scale, The Pianist marks the career high moment for Roman Polanski & Adrien Brody, is an emotionally devastating & powerfully moving cinema that's worthy of all the accolades it has garnered so far, and is amongst the finest examples of historical drama in existence. It certainly isn't going to be an easy sit for most but you'll be a better person for having done because some films, no matter how difficult, deserve to be viewed, and Roman Polanski's magnum opus is definitely one of those cinematic treasures. Strongly recommended.","

"bob the moo","2 April 2006","Wladyslaw Szpilman is a musician living with his family in 1930's Warsaw. The rise of anti-Semitism starts to erode their civil liberties, making them have permits to work, requiring them to wear armbands that identify them as Jewish and generally treating them like second-class citizens and lesser people. This gradual slide becomes increasingly serious as all Jews are ordered into one small area of the city, where whole families are given flats with one or two small rooms to be shared among six or seven people. As the murders and control of the Jews continue, Szpilman is left to try and survive while the war rages across Europe.I didn't bother to watch this in the cinema despite the Oscars and rave reviews simply because I could never get my head in the right space to spend my time on a subject that was never going to be an easy watch. With it coming onto television recently though I decided it was worth a look and easily got into it, which the emotional power of the story doing enough to carry it along for the duration. At times it does feel like watching war porn, as Polanski wheels out one more shocking atrocity after another and occasionally feels like he is involved in a game of one-upmanship with other Holocaust movies (so we don't just have a man thrown out a window, but a disabled old man thrown out a window). This was a bit of a problem for me because I wanted more to the film that just the horror shown to me. However the film does do more than that and generally does enough to be as impacting in the study of Szpilman as it is in just yet again reminding us of the terrible things done in Europe barely 60 years ago.On both levels the film works while never being something you should try and watch expecting it to be a fun night in. Staying away from the front line of the war, the film focuses on the effects on the innocent, specifically Szpilman, who struggles to just stay alive. Up till this point the film had been a bit obvious, with bad things happening while the Szpilman's argue over what to do etc, with the film relying heavily on the shock and horror of what was happening. The rest of the film is more about him being left alone and hidden within Warsaw, which although slow is still impacting and engaging. At this point Brody also steps up and becomes much better than before, showing so much with just a horrified look but still containing enough of a character to be more than just our eyes. The rest of the cast are all good but generally it is Brody that carries the majority of the film. Polanski directs with a very good eye for the breakdown of this world and it looks totally of period and convincing.Overall then, not a film to come to if you are hoping for a cheerful night in but one to watch to gain a wider appreciation of the atrocities that can so easily be allowed to take place. Ethnic cleansing and wars continue even as I sit writing these words so those that think this film is just an unnecessary wallow in past horrors would do well to take a minute and think. At times it could have been better but it is impossible to ignore the power of the story and the impact of the delivery.","

"lastliberal","28 May 2010","I have watched a lot of WWII films, but this is at the top of the list.Don't take my word for it, it won three Oscars, and should have won Best Picture; it did win Best Picture at the BAFTA awards, along with a Best Director for Roman Polanski (Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby). This is Polanski's finest film by far.Adrien Brody was magnificent, and his performance made you feel you were right there with him.It wasn't a pretty picture, the outstanding cinematography notwithstanding. Bodies lie in the streets, and people just passed them by. People were shot for asking a simple question. A man was so hungry that when his attempt to steal a woman's soup resulted in it falling to the ground, he fell to the ground and lapped it up.Amidst all the carnage and deprivation, Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) managed to survive until the end. An amazing story.","

"=G=","29 May 2003","""The Pianist"" is doubtless well crafted and technically and artistically sound albeit naive and conventional. The film parses into one hour of a stereotypical and exploitive regurgitation of the horrors of the Nazi reign over the Warsaw ghetto, where every German soldier is more evil than Satan and every Jew a pathetic victim, and one hour of Brody living like a rat foraging for sustenance amid the Warsaw ruination. Only in the very end does the film introduce a bit of irony and a sympathetic Nazi after countless missed opportunities to breath something fresh into what is just another in a very long list of films about the infamous ghetto (Families torn apart, summary executions, etc.).  Brody delivers a fine performance as a pianist and the film's centerpiece but is not required to perform the range of emotion deserving of a little gold statuette. Overall, the film is worthwhile but shows us nothing new and exploits rather than honors the memory of those Polish Jews who died in the conflict. ""The Pianist"" will play best with those who have not yet had their fill of Warsaw ghetto films. (B)","

Polanski's win was a surprise since the conventional wisdom had Martin Scorsese for ""Gangs"" winning the directing award as well.This tremendous holocaust film deals with the destruction of a family. The scene where a family had its wheelchair bound member tossed from a window and then shot as they ran was eerie and never to be forgotten.As a marvelous piano player, Brody captured the role with depth and a strong conviction. The scene where the family is placed on a train for their ultimate destiny can and must never be forgotten as well. From that point on, the focus of the picture becomes one of survival as Brody is able to elude the Nazi barbarians.A strong film in the tradition of ""Schindler's List.""

"MovieAddict2016","3 November 2004","Although I found ""The Pianist"" to be a commendable and fairly well-made effort, I did not find it to be a masterpiece. It certainly has the ""feel"" of an epic but compared to other WWII/Jewish movies (particularly ""Schindler's List"") it fails. I was shocked to see that the film had generated some fairly bad reviews on RottenTomatoes.com. I can understand where these authors are coming from -- ""The Pianist"" is a fine movie but uneven and not as great as it seems to think it is.At best I can compliment the good parts because some of them really are touching, but more often than not it's just too purposely sentimental to warm up to -- I never thought I'd say this but even Spielberg's version was less sugar-coated!Don't get me wrong, it's not glamorized and there are some brutal deaths, but it's just a bit too black-and-white and emotionally controlling for me to call it a masterpiece.3/5","

"richardchatten","30 December 2022","Despite the title Adrien Brody doesn't actually get to play the piano much during this film depicting the monstrous institutionalised bullying on an industrial scale that characterised the German occupation of Poland. The second half of the film also largely abandons dialogue for sound effects (what dialogue there is is in German).Growing steadily more gaunt and dishevelled Brody staggers through a Warsaw transformed into a ghost town scattered with corpses while subject to the casual brutality of uniformed thugs who plainly regard it all as a bit of a lark and coping with the hostility of native anti-semites.Director Polanski (90 next August) keeps on going from strength to strength. Originally an actor in the war films of Andrzej Wadja, here he finally addresses head-on the childhood traumas in occupied Poland which obviously lay behind his other films (like Brody the young Polanski was used for target practise by Nazis.When they finally appear the Russians actually get pretty short shift, and considering their recent activities in Ukraine, the observation about the Poles that ""No one thought they'd hold out so long!"" must currently be giving Putin sleepless nights.","

"JamesHitchcock","20 January 2017","There have been innumerable films about World War II, but relatively few about the Holocaust, a subject which, at least for the first few decades after the war, seemed to daunt film-makers by its very enormity. Since the 1980s, however, there have been some fine attempts to come to terms with the most notorious crime of the twentieth century, including Pakula's ""Sophie's Choice"" and Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is another to add to this list.The film is based on the autobiography of Władysław Szpilman, a Jewish pianist, who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland. (As one character points out, Szpilman's surname is an appropriate one; it is a Polonised form of ""Spielmann"", the German for ""musician""). In September 1939 the Szpilman family are living in relative middle-class comfort in Warsaw when they learn that the country has been invaded by Germany. The film then traces the way in which the situation of Poland, and especially of its Jewish community, deteriorates throughout the course of the war- the passing of anti-Jewish laws, the creation of the Warsaw Ghetto in November 1940 and finally the deportations to the concentration camps beginning in 1942. By a stroke of chance Szpilman is separated from his family when they are deported to Treblinka extermination camp. For a time he becomes a slave labourer, but manages to escape and is sheltered by non-Jewish friends linked to the Polish resistance, surviving while thousands are dying around him and while his city is gradually turned into a wasteland of rubble.A key scene comes towards the end of the film. Much of the city, including the building in which Szpilman was sheltering, has been destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising of August 1944, and Szpilman is desperately trying to hide in a ruined building when he is discovered by a German officer named Wilm Hosenfeld. Hosenfeld guesses that Szpilman is Jewish, but takes pity on him and spares his life, even bringing him food and giving him a coat to help him survive.Szpilman's story had a deep personal significance for Polanski, himself a Polish Jew who managed to survive the war in hiding, although other members of his family, including his mother, died. It is therefore unsurprising that it has a greater emotional resonance than many of Polanski's earlier films, which can often be rather emotionally cool. Szpilman is a gifted musician, but his survival has very little to do with his talent and a great deal to do with the kindness of others and with sheer luck. It is a role which called for a superb actor, and Polanski was fortunate enough to find one in the shape of Adrien Brody, who won a well-deserved ""Best Actor"" Oscar. (Strangely enough, Brody was not the director's first choice for the role- that was Joseph Fiennes, who was unavailable). Brody's Szpilman becomes a sort of Everyman figure, a tragic version of Chaplin's Little Tramp, stumbling his way through a city which has been reduced to a vision of Hell on Earth. As Roger Ebert put it, he is not a fighter or a hero but a survivor.Polanski himself won the ""Best Director"" award. The film was nominated for Best Picture, but lost to ""Chicago"". ""The Pianist"" is a harrowing record of man's inhumanity to man, but it is also a film with a message of hope in that it shows how even unspeakable barbarity like that of the Nazis cannot altogether extinguish man's better instincts, shown by the kindness and bravery of Szpilman's friends and his defiant rendition of Chopin's Grande Polonaise Brillante at the end. It is one of the most moving films about the war that I know, comparable in this respect to either Pakula's or Spielberg's. 9/10","

"Pedro_H","1 February 2005","Roman Polanski is something of a genius for being in the middle of world history. Even if he had never made a film in his life his autobiography would still have been fascinating and history packed. I won't try and summate it in detail, but it involves an escape not unlike the one presented here on film! Having turned down Schindler's List (for reasons much noted elsewhere) he decides to make this as his tribute to the anti-Jewish horrors of WWII. Interesting.Despite the awards (all deserved) this is not what you might call a ""fat"" film. It has one main theme: ""self preservation"" in a world gone mad and that limits my sympathy and involvement. Indeed the protagonist (Adrian Brody) has something that people can envy even in his darkest hour - a great musical talent.The question I ask myself is how much of this lifesaver influences his decisions? While many gave up or joined in the resistance movement, Brody watches from the window: very much a curious and non Hollywood approach. Brave but not to everyone's taste.The real Warsaw Ghetto was featured in the great Granada documentary series ""The World at War"" (quite frankly the most amazing piece of historical television ever created - if you can rent it do so) and nothing can be as shocking as the real pictures. However this is a close second.The early scenes of family life are like the scenes from the Titanic, we know what those on screen don't and we feel like calling out and warning them! In many ways the information is soft peddled and tokenised. We do not see the actual horrors of the death camps and even post war the survivors look too healthy to be believable. The only bum note in the entire movie.Although I had nothing to do with the making of this film I am proud of it. I am proud that millions of people have been educated and will continue to be educated about the horrors of war and what man does to man. But I didn't really enjoy it very much and I have no desire to see it again despite having some wonderful pieces of cinematography.","

A long trip in a large desert. And fear, hope and trust as only protection. It is a biographic piece but it speaks about values. It is a War tall but essence is peace behind reality. And it is a Polanski in which Adrien Brody is brilliant. For the art to discover each color of silent fight. For the strange occasions in which death is expected answer. But the final is a town in ruin, a Nazi officer and a piano. A kind of gift as birth of new time. Precise and not pathetic, harsh and dusty, cruel in a poetic manner, show of a life, it is one precious stone who remembers the respiration of earth and fragility of grass.","

The direction which was made by Roman Polanski, it was for one more time simply exceptional and he created another masterpiece. He succeeded on making us understand how his main character was feeling and made it easier for us to follow his story. The interpretation of Adrien Brody who played as Wladyslaw Szpilman was simply amazing and he deserved the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Emilia Fox's who played as Dorota and Thomas Kretschmann's who played as Captain Wilm Hosenfeld.

"henry8-3","5 May 2020","Follows a Jewish pianist (Brody) trying to survive in the Warsaw ghetto during WW2.A film broadly of 2 parts, the first covering the arrival of the nazis and its impact on the Jewish community most particularly Brody and his family. This is full of tension brought about the German atrocities and as the family descends further and further into hell. In many ways this is the most harrowing part of the film in that there are so many vulnerable family members to worry about as they move from disbelief and outrage to fear and some form of resignation.The bulk of the film though is a slow but fairly tense passage following Brody hiding and surviving alone in the empty ghetto, his life without food and warmth punctuated by moments of terror.The film is tense and like Schindler's List you do have this dreadful sense throughout of disbelief that this could have happened by people to people. Brody is very good in the lead and overall it is a considerable achievement - important to be sure. I just found that some passages took long to make their point - sorry.","

"diane-34","12 March 2005","Fortunately my wife convinced me to see this film on TV several nights ago; initially I was reluctant because I thought that it would end up being too tough for a overly sensitive softy like myself-how wrong I was! Polanski's film was not what I had expected; in all the publicity surrounding his return to films, I had failed to grasp the substance of the film. In hindsight this surprises me because for many years I have been curious as to why film makers had not focused on the extraordinary events of the Warsaw Ghetto and its eventual destruction by the Nazis. I have always thought that this event was one of the most powerful of a string of events that have been overlooked by film makers for years. The enormity of all that happened from '38 to '45 seem to have prevented people from mining the history of those years. It is conceivable that producers feel there is a fatigue clause at work here, meaning that there is possibly a feeling by producers that the public might be tired of non-military war films. Another possibility concerns the Jewish people themselves-a concern that they do not want this terribly painful history to be mined simply to provide fodder for film makers. Whatever the reason, there is to my mind a noticeable absence of films about these monumental but painful events of the mid twentieth century.Even given the drawbacks associated with watching a film on the small screen, this movie immediately gave the impression that it had the touch of genius about it. Polanski's superb direction; Brody's superb acting and Edelman's brilliant cinematography impart the stamp of excellence on the film. I am a film viewer who watches films as collections of images so Edelman's work knocked me out! The beauty of the clarity and darkness of the camera work was wonderful to watch. POlanski's shot selection of course allowed Edelman ample canvas upon which to paint in those wonderful grays and muted colours that were eventually seen on the screen. Diane and I have the tape of the film and it will definitely be watched many times in the future. In short, the film is as good as the awards that it justifiably received.","

This movie's telling of the methodical NAZI takeover and extermination of the Jewish people is brutal and chilling in detail. It portrays the crescendo of evil inflicted upon those people as their rights slowly were stripped away through the eyes of Wladyslaw Szpilman. This sugarcoats absolutely nothing. It sears many horrific scenes into your brain at the lack of any ounce of humanity by the NAZI's. It is of the highest quality in terms of production, screenplay, editing and of course the musical moments. This is top quality on this subject. Do not watch.....on a whim.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","27 February 2008","""The Pianist"" is a film that is impossible to dislike. In fact, it may be impossible to love it as well. It's a traumatic and difficult biographical account of one of the many unbelievable Holocaust survival stories. What makes ""Pianist"" stand out, however is the traumatic realism, the way that the story evolves to strike an emotional chord in regards to the Nazi's crimes and the unique role of music in the film.""The Pianist"" is the Oscar-winning best adapted screenplay from the autobiography of Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), an accomplished Jewish pianist in Warsaw right as World War II strikes. The film plays out as several scenes following a timeline from the initial invasion to the Warsaw ghetto to Szpilman's many hideouts in the city throughout the war. While the true sense of time is skewed and thus the true agony of Szpilman's isolation unrealized, the timeline clearly shows how the Jews and everyone in Warsaw for that matter had their lives transformed.What makes this film so effective is the way Oscar winners Ronald Harwood (screenplay), but mostly director Roman Polanski, go right for your heartstrings. The Nazis are portrayed as cold-blooded killers. There is no emotional build-up or excessive suspense in the film's violent moments. It is sudden and mechanical, leaving you wondering how anyone could do such a thing, when the fact of the matter was that's exactly how it happened: many times arbitrary, heartless killing. The whole effect that Polanski has created with the violence being viewed by Szpilman and his family through windows, isolated from the mêlée, is very effective in the way that it connects with how the viewer is very much isolated from the true nature of the violence. Polanski conditions you to be afraid every time Szpilman looks out the window that violence might occur, which is exactly what Szpilman was: very curious about what was going on, but truly afraid. The effect is brilliant.The films third Oscar winner, Brody, doesn't give an emotionally moving performance per say, but his performance is award-worthy in its realism through exquisite use of non-verbal skills and his natural demeanor. You can tell how the war has transformed him as a person through each stage--from day one to the final moments of the film.If there's a weakness to the film, it's the fact that it doesn't spend enough time grasping Szpilman as a pianist. There is no sense as to how important his playing is or why he plays. Instead, the focus is more on the unfolding the events of WWII. While the idea the film presents of him being a pianist simply because that's what he knows to do is effective towards the end, a greater understanding of what playing the piano means to him would have been ideal in the beginning.""The Pianist"" is a tremendous achievement in terms of successfully telling a often repeated story in a way that is uniquely effective. It focuses on the aspect of the Holocaust that speaks to perseverance, basic survival in a life of fear that plays out outside your window. It is a tough film, but it's a good one.","

"claudio_carvalho","18 January 2004","Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a Polish Jewish pianist very famous in Warsaw. When Germany invades Poland, his wealthy family and him are sent to the Warsaw Ghetto. Them they are sent to Treblinka, but Szpilman escapes in the train station. He struggles to survive, hidden in the most different places and depending on friend's sympathy to stay alive. He survives the war and died in the year 2000. This movie is a super production, very well directed by Roman Polanski and having an outstanding performance of Adrien Brody. However, this sad story does not present anything that was not showed before, like, for example, `Schindler`s List' did some years ago. There is a good movie (`Uprising' (2001), TV), showing better the events of the Warsow Ghetto uprising, but the intention of `The Pianist' is to show the true saga of Szpilman. I can perfectly understand that Jewish persons, who are majority in the cinema industry, have a great interest in keeping alive the atrocities of the Second World War. But these movies are very repetitive, showing horrible dramas of the most different survivors, or persons who died. However, there are so many other massacres of races to be explored through the human history and unfortunately they are not showed in movies like the murder of Jewish in the WWII. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): `O Pianista' (`The Pianist')","

The camera shots, the acting, the story and the feel of the film was all perfect. It really captured the realism of what it would have been like in them times. The one thing that was done perfectly throughout was that it captured the emotion of the characters and illustrated it so well.Speaking of characters. The arc of Adrien Brody's character was exceptional. Everything about him was done perfectly and it illustrated everything it needed to.Got to give props to Adrien Brody as well, phenomenal performance. Honestly one of the best I've seen in a long time.Only real negative I have to say is that I thought the final hour or so dragged at parts and it didn't need to be as long as it needed to.

"TxMike","26 June 2004","This movie is too long for what it depicts, one Jew's struggle to survive Nazi-occupied Warsaw during the second world war. The movie doesn't cover any new ground, the audience doesn't learn anything new. However, being a personal project for the director may account for its length. I hadn't planned to see it, because if you've seen one holocaust film, you've seen them all. And that is not in any way intended to minimize the horror of the mistreatment of the Jews, but how many times does a person need to see it reinacted to grasp the message? It happened, it was bad, we all need to do our part to see that nothing like that happens again. But I saw it for Adrien Brody, the hawkish actor who won the best actor Oscar for his performance. And, after seeing it, I believe it was deserved. The first hour of the movie established the setting and danger, the middle hour spends too much time showing the protagonist trying to survive, hiding in bombed-out buildings, scratching for food. We know it all happened, but if you show everything, the movie is 6 years long!!  The movie starts with actual black and white film footage of 1939 Warsaw, and we see its residents leading normal lives for that period. Then, cut to the movie, the pianist is playing for a live radio broadcast when bombs or artillery shells begin to explode and all Jewish families begin their fights for survival. Forced to wear identifying arm bands, eventually they were banished to their own ghetto, then the trains came. SPOILERS are contained in the rest of my comments, for my own recollection, please read no further. The last half hour of the movie pulls everything together. The pianist is helped by a German soldier who discovers him, has him play piano for him, then secretly brings him food as the war winds down. When the Russians finally come to Warsaw, the few remaining Jews are out of danger, the Germans are imprisoned, and eventually the pianist is playing again for the radio, and the final scene is his playing a concert before a live audience.

"truemythmedia","11 November 2019","If I'm being honest, I think Polanski winning the best director Oscar for this film is sort of like Scorsese winning his Oscar for ""The Departed""; both awards feel a bit like consolation Oscars. What do I mean by that? Well, I don't believe that this is the best film Polanski has put out; in fact, I wouldn't even put it in his top three. It is a good film, however, and with all the amazing movies that Polanski produced during his career I'm glad that he found a bit of recognition, even if it is for a film that isn't as polished as some of his others.Polanski himself said that his was the most personal film he's ever made, and there's good reason for that. Polanski was in his preteens when WWII washed over Poland, and he, like Wladyslaw Szpilman, survived the ghettos while their families were less fortunate (Polanski's mother was killed in Auschwitz). ""The Pianist"" shows a side of the holocaust that we rarely see, for it's not from the perspective of the camps which we see most of the film, but from the perspective of one who has escaped the camps and is still forced to live in a prison of isolation and degradation.As a whole, I think the story told in this movie is wonderful, and since it is based on a true story, it's hard to criticize it too much for structure, but at the same time, I do feel that this movie starts to drag in the second act. Most of the truly disturbing stuff happens in the first half of this film. The parts where Szpilman is separated from his family, the purging of the ghetto, the moving to concentration camps... all of that stuff happens within the first hour and fifteen minutes, and the last hour of this movie is mostly focused on Szpilman trying to stay quiet in apartments, trying to figure out what's gong on outside, and struggling to get over sickness. By no means does the story ever get boring- it's still fascinating, but the horrors of the first half of this movie are far more memorable than those in the second half.","

"Holt344","28 November 2018","This movie got everything right from the cinematography to the soundtrack, just pure perfection.
It was realistic, almost too realistic as it's depressing but in a good way. It feels real and you feel immersed from start to finish and it's because the director, Roman Polanski's knowledge and understanding of the holocaust and also the incredible acting performance of Adrien Brody, just stunning to look at. Seeing his transformation into a holocaust survivor and giving 100% into the role made this one of the best performances I've seen this year.
I'm glad that they showed that there were lots of Germans helping the Jews.They managed to create something more than a movie, this is pure art.","

"yoyomagoo","24 March 2003","I despise the term overrated (partly because of its often use on IMDB) but this movie is the dictionary definition of the term. How did it win those oscars? Why it is in the top 250? I don't know.Polanski's tribute to the holocaust is a largely pedestrian affair that suffers from a lack of style and tautness. The inclusion of many scenes in the movie is mysterious considering the fact they hold little relevance to either the holocaust or the Brody's character's story. The film therefore feels bloated and self-important. Polanski does not treat the subject matter with any opinion or style- and just shows us what happens before casually strolling onto the next scene. Polanski would argue that this is because the subject matter does not need any style or opinion added to it, which is fair enough. However the problem with this is, that it is extremely dull for the audience. The ""powerful"" elements of the movie are few and far between, bluntening their impact. Also, towards the middle of the film, there seems to be a genuinely scary lack of substance and we get treated to lots of long shots contrasted with close-ups. What this is supposed to tell us, is also a mystery. While the movie must be commended for its treatment of the subject matter and Adrien Brody's excellent performance, it feels more guided rather than directed. Its casual attitude to the violence seems mundane rather than shocking and there is nothing here that Steven Spielberg didn't do better in Schindler's List. Essentially dull, rather than powerful, only the last 45 minutes make this film memorable. 6/10","

"LW-08854","27 December 2023","Revisiting this film I found it really holds up very well. The film opens with invasion and the coming occupation of Warsaw, a family must now decide whether to flee, and if so where to go? Our main character is a middle-class musician, cultured, well dressed, handsome but his world is now turned up side down. The early scenes of the city apartments being emptied, of glass smashing, radio falling silent and distress are all really well directed and acted. We next move now to the Warsaw ghetto and the casual brutality and contempt the occupiers now display to the inhabitants. Our main character is still able to work as a pianist but his life now is looking increasingly precarious. The family fortune dwindles, money has little value anymore. You really have to give high praise to the costumes, props and locations, I really felt myself there living it. This is an English language film but you don't really hear any English accents which at least helps. It has a bit of a desaturated look but it's still very much something shot on film and not at all like some digital films we get now. The story is very much that of the pianist, everything that happens we see through his eyes. The thuggery and terror brought by the Nazis is revolting and shocking. There's a tiny bit of CGI but mostly it's all in camera and I have to give the production values very high praise. At times I did slightly loose track of what year it was, maybe that's deliberate. I also found our main character very passive, there's no mad heroics, no impassioned speeches from him, he's probably too shocked for anything remotely like that. As I said it's very much his story, we have no sense of who's winning or losing the war, no cut aways to generals looking at maps or giving out orders really. There's some great physical acting in here too, our main character's appearance change so much as he lives a more and more hunted and animal like life. He is truly just a survivor in an increasingly dangerous landscape. We see some acts of defiance and resistance, his life though is terribly lonely and he carries with him his love of music throughout his life on the run.","

"lee_eisenberg","23 May 2006","In what I assume was Roman Polanski's most personal movie ever, he tells the story of Polish-Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) doing everything possible to survive the Nazi occupation. As is the case with all of Polanski's movies, there are some very harrowing scenes, namely when the Nazi planes first start bombing the city, and when Szpilman has to hide. As Szpilman, Brody really brings out the most in the character (no doubt his sad face helps with that).I will say that the movie doesn't quite equal the profundity achieved by ""Schindler's List"". But maybe that's not a fair comparison, since Polanski probably wasn't aiming for that. Either way, this is definitely a movie worth seeing, as a message of hope in the darkest of times.","

"KnightsofNi11","14 March 2011","It takes a lot of guts to make a film about arguably the most tragic event in human history. The director must put the film together with care and respect towards those depicted in the film. The writer must pay attention to the details of the events and bring them across in the most respectful nature without exploiting the events for cinematic gain. The actors must have the utmost care for the characters they portray in order to properly tell such a tragic story. Roman Polanski's The Pianist hits all these marks. The film is adapted from the memoirs of a famed Polish Jewish pianist named Wladyslaw Szpilman. It chronicles the events of the Jewish exile into the Polish ghettos and their eventual relocation to the concentration camps. Szpilman, however, was not taken to a concentration camp and had to spend months hiding out from the Germans as they destroyed Warsaw, Poland. It is a very difficult story to portray, as well as watch, making it a harrowing yet memorable piece of art.I would never have known you could make such a despicable event such as this into such a glorious work of art. But Roman Polanski does it. He directs this film with such gracious beauty that shocks and mystifies the viewer. It is a film you can't take your eyes off of, no matter how much you want to. It is strange to call this such a beautiful film, but it is. It isn't beautiful in the sense that we often associate beauty with. It is beautiful in its portrayal of such tragic events through such a subtle and meticulous lens. Polanski directs every bit of this film with the utmost respect towards the subject matter. He stays so far away from making this an exploitation film and instead makes into into a work of art where the tragedy we witness on screen is almost hypnotic in its depiction.And to add to the emotional brilliance of this film, Adrien Brody does a fantastic job as Szpilman. His portrayal earned him an Academy Award for best actor and it's not difficult to realize why. He goes through such an dramatic transformation throughout this film, both physical and mental. He begins as an esteemed Polish pianist who is very likable and very homely. He has a loving family and a great career. But as the destruction of Warsaw caves in around him, so does his whole life. When he is separated from his family he must look after nobody but himself. It is very difficult to watch his tragic physical and mental deterioration. You think he's lost it all until the end of the film when you realize just how much he retains. Szpilman is not a pianist just to add a different kind of aspect to the film. He is a pianist because this supports the entire idea of the film. He shows just how important music and art is to the world, even in such tragic times. His ability to play the piano so well saves his life, as well as renews it. It is a fascinating thing to think about, even though it is something very subtle in the film.All this being said, The Pianist didn't strike as many emotional chords with me as I thought it would. I'm not sure why, but I was more mystified with the quality of the film, rather than emotionally moved by the events. They are undoubtedly tragic and still difficult to watch, but I didn't feel a lot of emotion boiling up inside of me while watching this film. I only felt a sincere amazement by how well the film was put together and how great Adrien Brody was. I am in no way saying this isn't an emotional film, but it just wasn't as striking to me as it would be to other people. I feel like more could have been done with this film, but at the same time I feel like there was just enough in this film to give it its consistent subtle beauty. I wasn't quite as drawn in by this film as I thought I would be, but it is undoubtedly excellent.The Pianist is a beautiful film. I wasn't moved by it enough for it to earn a spot in one of my all time favorite films, but it is a film experience I will never forget. I will always remember just how well constructed this story was and how successfully beautiful of a film it was. This is an unforgettable film that shows what dramatic historical filmmaking is all about.","

"BlizzyFoxTF","11 December 2020","A very good war film that depicts the throes of war to a tee, but lacking the nuance that is evident in Spielberg or Cauron's works. Polanski seemed to opt for a less realistic approach in directing this movie, and characters seem more aware that they are in a film than in Schindler's List or Children of Men. In other words, despite the direction being incredibly deft and skillful, it can feel stiff at certain points of the film, and the set pieces artificial and unnatural. The pacing is very well done here, but the fast pace bereaves time for character building. As a result, despite the plethora of violence and moments of despair, they don't land as hard on an emotional level. The side characters/victims are not fleshed out enough, and there's a feel of spectacle for spectacle sake, where scenes play out for an overt intention to fish out visceral reactions. Without ample build up, I find it rather void. There are also quite a few plot contrivances in the film, which point to its main goal of achieving mainstream appeal. The story is decent, and I do not consider it a weak asset despite how simple it is. The protagonist's journey is wild and gripping, but it is not consistently interesting enough to considered very memorable - there aren't quite enough iconic moments or sequences that leaves a profound mark. The reaction between two certain characters at the end of the film could have used a bit more development, especially for one person whom we only come across at the end of the film; a better approach would be to do a dual/ interspersing narrative to introduce that character before that critical scene, such that it holds more weight. Speaking of characters, I feel like there are not enough bad important characters in the film, as opposed to a few good ones that exist. Perhaps it is intentional, with which the film conveys the message that warfare itself is the evil menace while humanity is inherently kind. Still, if there is more contrast presented in certain individuals, those ""noble"" characters would make a bigger impact in both the story and the audience, since it would accentuate the film's ""message"". Lastly, the film's core theme isn't entirely new either. I don't see any new ideas presented in the film other than the cruelty of war, and the struggles of suppressed ethnic groups under tyranny. The protagonist is a lovable character, carried by an amazing performance by Brody, but it is also rather one dimensional that sees little character growth by the end of the film. The Pianist is after all a standard war film, a very well rounded, crowd-pleasing one at that, or at least it feels like one. It does not seem to try achieve much more beyond that.As for the positive aspects, there isn't much that people haven't said already. The cinematography is fantastic, especially the scenes filmed at night. Brody's performance is electrifying and pretty much carries the whole movie. Like I said, the pacing is very well done, and although I find the first hour of the film rather dull, it never feels like it drags at any point, thanks to Polanski's expert direction. The wide appeal of the film means that it is a good recommendation for people who are new to war films. Overall, I don't think it is a 10/10 masterpiece that many hyped it up to be. I think Schindler's List and Children of Men are both far superior films. Yet, it certainly is an enjoyable experience if you are looking for a more palatable war film (there is a fair bit of violence though, so I wouldn't consider it too family friendly).","

"ronakkotian","11 September 2020","There have been some great Holocaust films made in the past such as Schindler's List but what Roman Polanski, Ronald Harwood and Adrien Brody brought to The Pianist make it one of the best Holocaust films ever made.The Pianist follows Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish piano player, who tries to survive in the Polish ghetto during the Holocaust.There are very few films that leave me speechless by the end of it and The Pianist is no different. I remember just sitting as the credits rolled and thinking how lucky I was avoid such a brutal and inhumane period of time. The way Roman Polanksi directed this film is absolutely excellent. This is a very emotional experience that will bring you on the verge of tears because of how sad it is. Polanksi shows Nazi occupied Poland in such a brilliant way. I loved the ugly colour palette this film had as it reinforced how dark and depressing it was during that time. The way innocent people were shot for the smallest of things also showed the ruthless nature of the Germans and how difficult it was to survive. There is an absolutely fantastic shot at the end showing a whole row of destroyed buildings where I couldn't believe how cruel humanity was.I remember seeing Adrien Brody in films and TV shows like King Kong and Peaky Blinders but his performance in The Pianist is truly mesmerising. It's no surprise that he won an Oscar for it. I don't think I've ever felt this sympathetic towards a character in a film for a long time. Brody captures the helplessness and vulnerability of Szpilman perfectly. I cared for him all the way and really wanted him to survive and it's mainly because of the range of emotion Adrien Brody is able to bring in his performance that I was able to do that.The Pianist is one of the greatest Holocaust films I've seen. It shows Nazi occupied Poland in a very honest and realistic way without sugarcoating any of it and conveys the struggle a Jewish man goes through as heartbreaking as possible. It's a definite must watch!","

"ruby_fff","19 January 2003","The Pianist is a beautiful film in spite of the obvious bleak subject: the survival of pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew during WWII in Warsaw. The film has much warmth - human spirit a-kindled behind it all. Adrien Brody is simply superb (almost surreal) in his true to life portrayal of Szpilman - tenacity and courage personified beyond reproach. We get to see a quieter side of Brody (Eric the war photo-journalist in Elie Chouraqui's ""Harrison's Flowers"" 2000, Sam the union organizer in Ken Loach's ""Bread and Roses"" 2000, Ritchie in Spike Lee's ""Summer of Sam"" 1999) - an impressive, subdued performance all the way. Of course, director Roman Polanski is the sustaining unrelenting force throughout the entire 2 hrs. 28 mins. filmic journey. (In his interview with Charlie Rose on PBS, Brody mentioned that he was expected to lose 30 lbs. in weight to inhabit the lead role's emaciating period, besides prompted to diligently play Chopin on the piano for 6 months, 6 days a week.)This is much more than just another Holocaust movie (neither ""Schindler's List"" or ""Sophie's Choice""). It's Polanski's own: he gave the film quite an emotionally restrained treatment, almost felt like a documentary with doses of stark photography, not without hints of poetry at times. Have patience, there is action, suspense, and you shall be rewarded towards last part of the film, with teardrops for sure. Actually, occasional smiles and a chuckle were afforded. It is taut human drama complete - even though we know of the outcome, we still worry and startle, relieve and sigh along with Brody's character at his brush with danger throughout the film. The audience is very much in the first person alone and lonely with Szpilman on the screen. And when joy arrives, it's truly touching.The story is based on Szpilman's book (written 4 years after the war) with screenplay by Ronald Harwood (Cry the Beloved Country 1995, Mandela - TV 1987, The Dresser 1983.) The soundtrack included many Frédéric Chopin (1810-1849) piano pieces: Nocturne, Ballade, Prelude, Waltz, Polonaise and Mazurka. Wojciech Kilar provided additional music, and Hervé de Luze on film editing - both have collaborated on Polanski's ""Ninth Gate, The"" 1999, and ""Death and the Maiden"" 1994. Cinematography by Pawel Edelman, who was in many film projects by Polish writer-director Andrzej Wajda. Production designer Allan Starski and costume designer Anna Sheppard were involved in Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" 1993. It's worthwhile to visit the official Web site:  Kudos to everyone involved on this project - such integrity and strength, and to R.P. Productions, Focus Features (also distributed Todd Hayne's ""Far From Heaven"" 2002), and Studio Canal.Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" truly deserved the Cannes Film Festival 2002 Palme d'Or award for the Best Feature film.","

"claszdsburrogato","11 October 2023","Many films involving the Second World War seek to explore the war itself, the direct confrontation and the death of soldiers. However, some others seek to explore the victims of war and how they managed to survive, this is the case with The Pianist. This film develops its characters and story very well, you can notice a clear difference in the protagonist's mentality over time and how he gradually took the war more seriously. Nothing seems forced, wanting to show the viewer in every way how bad the consequences are. Things happen naturally and the deaths are raw, they are not heroic, they are exactly the way they occur in real life.

Like Schindler's List, The Pianist accurately documents the horrors of the holocaust to such an extent that it exists less like a work of art, and more like a public service. Films like this help us never to forget and never to repeat this awful moment in human history. Classroom viewings are mandatory. Not to mention, a world class performance by Adrian Brody. He is immersed in this role. To see him wandering through the rubble of Warsaw, looking for any last morsel of food to eat is a stroke of acting and cinema genius that you won't believe even when you see it.

"SnoopyStyle","19 September 2016","It's 1939 Warsaw. Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a Jew and a pianist on the radio. He falls for Polish girl Dorota. The Germans invade and the Szpilman family expects to live through another war. However, their lives slowly deteriorate as government decrees force them into the Jewish ghetto. Itzak Heller tries to recruit Wlad and his brother Henryk into the Jewish police but they refuse. As his family is put on trains, Wlad is pulled out by Itzak. Wlad joins the resistance and smuggles in material. He sneaks out and finds friends who help to hide him. He witnesses the Germans battling their way into the ghetto from his hiding place. He finds help from Dorota who is now married and pregnant. From his hiding place, he witnesses the start of the Warsaw uprising.Roman Polanski delivers a depiction of a survivor of the Holocaust. He is more or less passive for too long until pushed. He survives due to kindness of others. He does not fight not due some moral stand but rather a lack of proactive heroism. It's a rather disengaging trait although I can see Polanski's point of view. The other annoying aspect is his surprise and constant reaction to the shocking inhumanity. None of this makes him less realistic. In many ways, he's a very human character and flawed not in any evil ways. It doesn't make him an easy, or appealing character. The world is well constructed. The most compelling scene is actually when the family is stuck waiting out in the sun for the train. The train has been done every time but to wait in a holding pen is more unusual. This is a great Holocaust movie but the leading character is unusually not so appealing.","

"eddie_baggins","2 December 2014","Divisive director Roman Polanski has had a polarizing career both behind camera and in a personnel sense yet whatever one may feel about the man or the filmmaker there is little doubt that his most effective and most profound movie is 2002's The Pianist. A true life war tale of incredible determination and bravery, Polanski's telling of accomplished Poland pianist and Jew Wladyslaw Szpilman ranks as one of cinemas greatest War set tales thanks to an incredibly realistic feel and a raft of award worthy acting turns.Justifiably winning Polanski a Best Director Oscar, The Pianist sees the veteran director at his highest creative peak, an artist moulding with his material perfectly to create a vividly alive look into the atrocities that faced Warsaw's Jewish community and all others of similar creeds during Hitler's reign of terror. Polanski's Warsaw is brimming with stark images, from bodies strewn in the streets of the Jewish ""ghettos"", snow covered buildings in the harsh reality of a European winter and the strange comforts of an upmarket café as people go hungry outside, it's unquestionable that the setting of The Pianist is a character unto itself and part of the reason the movie works to the extent it does. It's interesting also to note how many a time Polanski films some of the movies most confronting scenes (wheelchair bound elders thrown from windows etc.) from a wide shot perspective, giving us the viewers a feeling of witnessing these events from far, powerless to stop what is happening yet not to the extent of being unaffected by it, much like our protagonist Wladyslaw Szpilman.It would be remiss now with a decade hindsight of Adrien Brody to not remark on the power he displayed here as Szpilman. Brody inhabits Szpilman to an extent you quickly forget it is an actor you are watching, whether he is brave, scared or as time wears on dangerously gaunt, Brody delivers the Oscar winning turn that seemingly set him up for an illustrious career that so far has sadly failed to eventuate. It's impossible to say with full assurance that it's Brody's fault completely that he has failed to get close creatively to what he delivered here in Polanski's effort or if it is filmmakers that have failed him in their material. Whatever the case may be regarding Brody's disappointing post-Pianist career there is no taking away from his ageless performance here in an ensemble that all play their parts to perfection from Frank Finlay as Szpilman's aging father through to Thomas Kretschmann's small but pivotal role as German captain Wilm Hosenfeld.A heartening tale of survival, an indictment of the horrors of war and the evil within humanity, The Pianist is not always an easy watch but it's an important one. A truly stunning tale of the will to survive and a tension filled 2 and a half hours thanks to Polanski's no fuss professional turn behind camera, this is true life based storytelling at its finest and a worthy film to sit alongside other revered War based film classics.5 bits of caramel out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com","

The movie's impressive set design and passionately acted extras showcase the brutal sufferings of innocent lives in a powerful and purposeful way without resorting to cheap thrills for the audience.Wladyslaw Szpilman was not a hero or a fighter but a survivor whose salvation depended solely on luck. The film's believability and realism stem from its ability to convey this truth. Although the movie can be emotionally draining and heartbreaking, it is worth the sacrifice. The story of the talented Polish pianist is inspiring and serves as a reminder of the resilience of the human spirit.","

"Angry_Arguer","7 March 2004","Some irony: every time a director attempts to be visually daring, the public doesn't accept it.  Scott tried in 'Blade Runner', Cameron in 'Abyss', Spielberg in 'Empire of the Sun', and Kubrick in 'Barry Lyndon'.  Why? Maybe because the scripts aren't accepted...This is your only spoiler warning...Here Polanski is visual in a different sense than these.  Spielberg is an emotion-control freak determined to manipulate our every reaction in order to make us accept his vision.  'Schindler' especially relied on this tactic; weaving images, emotions, and especially music together.Polanski survived the Holocaust, so most detail stems from his memory and not imagination.  So, while Spielberg is a Hollywood Jew reminiscing on the Holocaust, Polanski is the real deal.  His impersonal method is intentional since reality doesn't have background musical cues to warn us about upcoming suspense.  Polanski's focus is also different from his Western brethren. Compare his visualization of the ghetto wall to what Spielberg did with the 'Jurassic Park' fence.  The emphasis is not on people, it's circumstance. Brody is keen to surviving in these circumstances after 'Thin Red Line'. The last time Spielberg tried this was 'Raiders'.Here Polanski is darker than Spielberg.  Optimism is beat to death despite the loops the script takes into ""made-for-TV"" Land.  Compare the ""girl in the red dress"" in 'Schindler' to the ghetto-runner boy.  It's about comparing imagination to memory.'Training Day' had the same problems, but less insight into getting around them.Film is music though the two art forms are different creatures.  Both rely on pacing, measure, and beat, but film has three dimensions to sort through. This is distant and impersonal, yet understanding.  Thus, Polanski shows he is more human than his Hollywood counterparts that want to amaze. On that note, this sorely deserved an Oscar for Best Sound.  Even if the music is ersatz, the sound design isn't.Spielberg tried this movie earlier to lesser effect: it was called ""Empire of the Sun"".Final Analysis = = Learn from this...","

"MovieGuy109","25 November 2011","After declining to direct Schindler's List due to personal reasons, Polanski set out direct a WWII survival story of his own. The Pianist lacks the narrative sweep of Schindler's List but has strong acting and personal direction. The film is beautifully crafted and original from other similar motion pictures. It distinguishes itself from Polanski's other masterpieces because it has the heart his films usually do not possess. It's just as haunting as his other movies but the beauty and sickness of humanity are contrasted in a way that not even Polanski has ever successfully done before. By far Adrien Brody's finest performance and probably Polanski's best film.","

"fred-houpt","27 June 2007","There is a certain hallmark in a Polanski film and I have used the words ""relentless"" and ""harrowing"" out of respect and observation. Polanski often wields his art in challenging, aggressive and disturbing ways. Some have complained that his predilection to violence and blood are sometimes a bit much. However, though this film has all of that and then some, the sum of the parts is equal to the incredible story of Wladyslaw Szpilman. Having not heard of him before, the first time I saw this film I was shocked on many levels. As a Jew, of course, I had a hard time keeping my eyes on the screen as the details of Nazi brutality were presented like a hard slap on the face. As a pianist myself, I was stunned at how I had missed this mans story and amazed at how good he was as an artist.There will always be comparisons made by critics when a so-called holocaust movie is made. People draw lines, in this case, to Schindler's List and other fine films. It is odd, isn't it, that Schindler's story took place in Crackow and this film in Warsaw and in each case we feel that humanity had reached the nadir point of misery. Of course that is not true: the death camps, where so many ended up, were the bottom of the pit. ""The Pianist"" shows us the story of the great Warsaw Jewish population and how it was rounded up, put to work, then obliterated or shipped to death camps. The Warsaw Ghetto uprising was one of the few occasions during the war when Jews rose up against the Nazi war machine. But let me return to the movie as such.I have no doubts in my mind that the hand of fate came to protect Szpilman. The obvious philosophical question then becomes: why him and not his whole family? It's an impossible question when we ask it but the whole film begs the question. It is an imponderable conundrum but for me the hand of fate was as plain to see as anything. His survival comes in many flavors. He is aided by the hated ""capos"", the Jewish police in the ghetto. He is helped by artists in the Christian community who knew of his own fame and took enormous risks to help him as best they could. He was assisted by the Polish underground. Finally, in the most moving part of the film, he is aided in the most unexpected manner, by a high ranking German officer, who, upon discovering him hiding in a totally bombed out quarter of the city (we never know why the officer was there, seeing that the blocks and blocks of city were reduced to total rubble)....asks him to play the piano for him; incredibly he plays and to break your heart. The officer inexplicably has sympathy for him and provides him with food and in the end his own winter coat. Our emotions by this time are so overwrought with seeing what Szpilman had suffered that to see him saved yet again by a German soldier.....leaves us raw.This film has the look and feel of what it must have been like, Polanski having taken pains to hold little back in terms of the brutality, random murder and deprivation of such huge numbers of people. Adrien Brody, what can you say of this performance? He is one of those rare number of actors who can say everything with their eyes. Giancarlo Gianini always does that. Brody often reduces his thoughts and feelings into wordless cries that pour out of his eyes; if you cannot feel moved to tears when he says nothing then you just don't have the receptors to pick it up. To say that his evocation of Szpilman was sensational is too weak a summary. Would that more actors could reach into their souls to pull together such depth, cinema would be graced with more masterpieces. This film is so powerful I doubt we have the ability to drink it all in in one go. So richly deserving of the 3 Oscars. Brodie's performance is so staggering, he will probably not eclipse it again. A monumental story of survival amidst mountains of death, destruction and heart break. A rare cinema event indeed.","

"johnnyboyz","5 May 2008","That first scene where Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) plays in the recording suite, in Warsaw, for the Polish radio station sums up not only the entire film but Szpilman's dedication and attitude towards his music and his ability to play music. He is sitting there, live on air, as bombs rain down on the city before one hits the building he is in. People are starting to panic behind a soundproof window but it is a suspenseful panic because whilst we in the studio can see the panic and stress the disc jockey is going through, we are tantalisingly put on hold in terms of the horror of the attack. Then a bomb hits the studio room we're in and we wake up to what's happening, as does Szpilman. He must stop playing after previously continuing.The next time Szpilman plays the piano in a war zone where his life is threatened will be the crescendo for not only the Second World Wartime journey of horror Szpilman must endure, but also for the last time danger is that close to him as is a piano. There are scenes in the film where he is so close to a piano and yet playing it would result in his quick demise; but he is strong enough and powerful enough to be able to remember the music and play on through his mind  that adds extra importance to that near-the-end wartime scene when he must play with 'danger' watching on.The film begins and ends in Poland, during the Second World War and we are taken through the various stages of horror imposed by the invading Nazi Germans during their assault on most of mainland Europe. The film's opening third acts not too much like a documentary that might shovel the message: ""The Germans were evil people"" down our throats and not too much like an over the top experimental art film. I read that the film is European produced which should come as no surprise because its aesthetic is very much that of realism, the dominant European aesthetic. So we learn of one family's struggle through the days of the Nazi rule and the film presents us with a hierarchy of Nazi invoked violence. There are the initial scenes of humiliation as a man must walk in the gutter for the crime of being Jewish but there is also the equally awkward to watch as I'm sure it was to shoot scene at a cross roads when Jewish strangers must dance together. From here, the levels are cranked up further and further and it's not long before stone cold violence is being presented to us.But The Pianist is much more than a realistic take on Polish struggles at this time with a few scenes inter-cut to show some atrocity. The film is a breath of fresh air and suggest to me that Roman Polanski has viewed previous Second World War film efforts and corrected them where he thinks corrections should be made. Not a fan of Saving Private Ryan for its lack of mentioning other Allies? Well, Polanski takes time out here for his characters to mention the British and the French over the radio they listen to. Squeamish enough to look away from heavy violence in Second World War films but maintain an interest in the subject anyway? Well here, Polanski shoots his action and his violence in such a way that just these scenes alone go a long way in helping label him an 'auteur'.These scenes and shots are littered throughout the film and contain a certain point of view thinking behind them. For instance, when later on in the film there is guerrilla fighting between Germans and ghetto inhabitants, we always see the action from Szpilman's perspective that is to say the camera never cuts to ground level to show the violence or to try and sell it as entertainment. All we know is that one side is over there, one is over here and they fight; another touch being that for most of the time we do not see the rebels or where they shoot from but we do hear the gunfire. Likewise, when a German soldier is hit the camera never cuts to that level to confirm us the kill  everything is done in point of view format from the window and is kept that way. This gives a scene when Szpilman is actually on the ground level and close to a corpse of a woman he saw get shot a few days ago an extra bite because now we are closer to the kill, it is our first proper look at the result of a gunfight that has been and gone  our conscience and awareness catches up with us.And this tactic is used by Polanski more than once. When a crippled Jew is thrown from his balcony, we see it from the Szpilman's window but when Jews are executed by way of the gun, we are helplessly trapped on that ground level and must witness the atrocity, partly because Szpilman is not there watching from afar in his home or from a window. The added disturbance for these kills is that the cripple cannot defend himself and the fact the officer must reload his gun  also notice how each Jew lying down has their own way of dealing with the inevitable: some keep their face down on the floor but others look ahead giving everything added tragedy. The Pianist works on many levels of storytelling and informs as well as shocks without relying on neatly plotted stories  it is a war fought between superpowers told from the point of view of someone who is not a superpower, and the result is brilliant.","

"ftm68_99","27 February 2003","If you think that movies that deal with Nazi atrocities are inherently worthwhile, then you might think that this movie is inherently worthwhile. If, on the other hand, you expect a movie, whether it deals with Nazi atrocities or not, to actually tell a story, then I'd say there's a good chance you *won't* find this movie worthwhile.  What does this movie give us? Well, it gives us a string of Nazi atrocities, very realistically depicted, and it gives us what I suppose is supposed to be a main character, but it gives us precious little else!  Most of main character's screen time is given over to him being acted upon by circumstances and by other people, but very little of him being pro-active, himself.  And even his passivity might be interesting if we knew what he was thinking or feeling.  But we are never given that information.  We never know what it is that he really wants.  Or how he feels, say, about the fact that his family was shipped off to their probable death, but he was saved by a fluke.  The picture is certainly well-made from the stand point of art direction and cinematography, but story-wise, it's a shambles.  As far as I'm concerned, Roman Polanski owes me big-time.  Thank you.","

"cherylkyrandia","16 April 2023","Adrien Brody does a stellar job in this World War Two film. It tells of a Jewish pianist who finds himself under siege by Nazis and struggling to survive amidst the apocalyptic situation he finds himself in. The film is beautifully shot, written and acted. There's some very hard scenes to watch, inherent of these kinds of films. There's very sudden and unexpected violence. You'll see some pretty helpless moments where you just want to reach into the screen and intervene. The film could be triggering for some, particularly those who are Holocaust survivors. But that's just a testament to how expertly done the film is.","

They could make this movie with original character and it wouldn't change a thing . What's the point of the movie ? What's this movie is all about ? This is a story of one guy who survived war . That's it. The main hero is hardly a hero in any sense of that world . He's hardly a character. He's more like an object . Instrument that goes from one hands to another hands . This must be the most inactive hero in the history of the cinema . There isn't a single moment when he did something for others ( his family doesn't count). He's got no personality at all . The Oscar for Adrien Brody is a scandal . FOR WHAT ?! For one sad face through whole movie ?! He did convince me that he's a pianist . There's one good scene here when Szpilman ""plays"" on piano. It doesn't change the fact that ANYONE could play what Brody plays here . Even a guy from street like me. One of the most undeserved Oscars ever. The nomination for Oscar would be too much for his ""performance"".""The Pianist"" wastes time to show us scenes of Nazi's killing Jews and destroying Warsaw . I'm sorry , but it takes much more to touch my heart than showing simply bad people doing bad things to good people . Also , since our hero is an empty character , then why should I care if he's struggling to survive ? I didn't care for him for a moment. In the end the entire movie seems pointless and empty.There is a great Russian movie "" Sudba cheloveka"" from 1959 . It tells a story about a guy that lost everything during a war. Yet , he never give up . He kept helping other people when he could , even if it could cost him his life . It's a hunting movie about man that survived psychically and emotionally a nightmare of war . It's touching and strangely uplifting . Watch it and then watch Polanski's ""masterpiece"" and you should notice how empty and lacking heart ""The Pianist"" really is. One more thing . Some people in Warsaw were against Szpilman , some were neutral , some helped him . It's sad that in the end the movie seems to tell us that a German officer was the person responsible for Szpilman's survival. Really ?! Another ""Good Nazi "" cliché in Hollywood movie ?! In the ending credits there is only note about what happened to that German officer after the war. There is no information about the Polish people who helped Szpilman . Why ? If there is no information about their post war life , the movie should inform us about it. In the end it seems that Szpilman didn't give a f*** about people who saved him . Talk about disrespect. The German officer didn't risk anything at all . The war was already over . The Polish people who helped Szpilman risked their lives and lives of their families. They should be mentioned here.We shouldn't make movies about people like Szpilman . It's not a bad thing that he wanted to survive. Everybody wants to life . Still , there is no lesson for us – the audience from Szpilman's story. We should make movies about Irena Sendlerowa – true humans , true heroes.I give ""The Pianist"" 2/10 , because of beautiful music (Chopin).","

"skymovies","2 October 2003","Heavy subject matter frightens people. Few dared say an unkind word about Philadelphia (AIDS!) when it first came out, regardless of the fact that it was dreadful. Folks seem similarly reluctant to find fault with The Pianist (The Holocaust!), though it's a far superior film.Being a survivor himself, Polanski is to be applauded for his clear-eyed depiction of life and death in the Jewish ghetto, but his matter-of-factness had a curiously distancing effect on me. I felt uninvolved. It was also a brave move to omit subtitles from the German dialogue, but getting the gist of what is being said is not the same as understanding and once more I felt left out.Further, many of the events leading to changes in Szpilman's situation remain unclear. On other occasions, Polanski labours his point and I just wanted him to move on to the next episode. He's a very good director, but he won the Oscar amidst a very weak field (and I include Scorsese's work on Gangs Of New York) - remember that this is the same body of people that anointed Ron Howard 'best director' a year previously.Impressive at times, but uneven and occasionally sluggish and frustrating.","

"Morejambo54","20 August 2021","First off...what an amazing start this movie has. The beginning is so absolutely terrifying and saddening to watch. It is incredibly tense with an awful atmosphere perfectly built for this kind of movie. It also doesn't refrain from showing violence which makes you want to look away from how brutal it is. All this, with the amazing acting and amazing soundtrack, create for a very depressing film. Also the cinematography is excellent. I do find that the middle Chunk of the movie, wasn't all that great...and I find it really hard to say anything negative on a movie about such a touching subject, but as solely a film stand point. The middle section is extremely repetitive and slow which ends up making it quite boring. The climax does turn it around but only very last minute, still a great ending though. I do think movies like this are extremely important, especially for the younger generations (including myself). There is a lot in this movie that can teach people which is brilliant.","

"philip_vanderveken","20 October 2004","The marketing departments of the different production houses always know how to make a huge hype about a movie. That's why I always try not to see a movie immediately after it gets many international prizes. I don't want to be disappointed because my expectations were just too high.For 'The Pianist' I didn't make an exception and I'm glad I didn't. I just saw it for the first time on DVD and I can only say that this is a true masterpiece. No, not because it got so many awards, neither because Roman Polanski directed it and certainly not because this is a movie about the Jews. I think this is a modern classic and a true masterpiece simply because I was blown away by the story! It shows how the Jews had to live in the ghetto with so many people on so little space, how the Nazi's randomly shot people and humiliated them, but also that not all Germans were such horrible pigs.Roman Polanski made an authentic movie about what happened in the Jewish ghettos and he did an excellent job if you ask me. He didn't portray the war and the Jews the way Spielberg did with Schindler's list. He shows us what happened by following Wvadyslav Szpilman - a young and famous pianist - from the last days before the beginning of the war until the war is over. Don't expect any images from the concentration camps like you saw in Spielberg's movie. The complete story is situated in Warsaw - in the Jewish Ghetto and never leaves it. Roman Polanski did not only create a great visual experience with this movie, it's the music that gives this film an extra and subtle, even poetical touch. There are many scenes of war and destruction, the special effects are very realistic and were never intended to glamorize the movie. Every scene is frightening and realistic, but it is the beautiful classical music that makes all the depicted horrors a little less hard to chew...I can recommend this film to everybody and I'm convinced that every one should see this movie at least once. But I think that the people who are interested in the history of the Jews during the second world war will love this movie the most. I guess that everybody who saw Schindler's list and loved it will love this one as well and I just can't say which one of the two was the best. I rewarded this movie with a 10/10. Don't hesitate to watch it.","

Music – a form of freedom, playing music – of liberation, composing music – special case of the creationist providence.Away from the fact that I saw this movie long time ago I probably will never forget it. A chased piano player in the contrast of the war and the ruined buildings is an image of contradiction which dives in the mind and lay there for a a very long time. The only one ability of man to succeed in expressing and protecting him is something very special. And what if the circumstances are force marjorie? Is it creativity the only one string deep in us that love is pulling to sing its humble messages? Really wonderful movie but not for everyone. It shows human survival which is threatened by man an believing in only one thing when everything around is falling apart. It shows how when we walk in the right direction there is always a new way.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/","

"DennisLittrell","8 January 2004","It's hard to watch this film and not think of the situation in the Middle East today. What is worse, being stuffed into cattle cars and sent to death camps or being blown up by suicide bombers (or bulldozed by machines of steel)? For me the answer to this strangely relevant question is the former. I know that the old Jewish Defense League that I recall from my college days, whose slogan was something like, ""Never Again,"" would agree and so would most of the population of Israel. I think the terrorist Islamic groups ought to be required to view this film and/or some others like it on what happened to the Jews in Europe during the time of the Nazis so that they might have a better appreciation of why they will never be able to overrun Israel and why the United States continues to support Israel even while questioning some of Sharon's policies.Director Roman Polanski tells the familiar horror tale, this time with a concentration on the Jews of Warsaw and in particular on the famed pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. (The screenplay by Ronald Hardwood is based on Szpilman's memoir). Polanski spares us none of the brutality or the sadomasochism that is an inevitable interpretation of the events. He has the Jews meekly acquiesce to the increasingly horrific Nazi demands, and then has them just lie down when told to and accept a bullet through the skull.(Actually the vast majority of the Jews were not shot, of course, since the bullets were too costly and needed elsewhere. Indeed, as long as I am doing an aside, the stupidity of the Nazis in wasting their resources in genocide contributed to their losing the war. Small irony. But of course that was a war they could not win anyway. If by some magic they could have gotten the Jews--especially Jewish physicists--to work for them, that would have been their only chance, which once again demonstrates the self-destructive nature of Hitler and his followers.)Polanski shows us the Jews who collaborated with the Nazis and he even has a Jewish boy in the compound as they await the cattle cars selling candy at inflated prices, and then later a Nazi who talks to his Jewish workers about trading goods and says, rubbing his fingers together, ""That's what you're good at, isn't it?""It is interesting to compare The Pianist with Vittoria De Sica's The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (1971), an entirely different sort of film, but one with a similar theme and some similar scenes as the Jews, this time Italian Jews, are loaded into the cattle cars. The experience in these films is always the same for me in at least one respect. I want so much to shout: ""Do something! Don't let it happen! Charge them with the sheer mass of your bodies, if nothing else. Better to die fighting than to die like cattle."" But of course I was not there. We think we know what we would do, but unless we are confronted with the actual situation, we don't know. And of course we have hindsight.At one point, Szpilman and his brother are talking as they eat their thin soup and their bread. The brother tells him that the cattle cars are going to Treblinka but they return empty and that there are no cars containing food that go that way. He concludes, ""They are exterminating us.""Polanski's point is that the Nazis were able to actually commit their ghastly mass murders (and the German populace to excuse them) because they had come to believe that Jews were not human and that they were only killing vermin. The Jews had been demonized, which is the first step toward genocide. We declare that our enemies are not human, and that allows us to kill them with moral impunity. I had a new thought while I watched this time, thinking: a respect for animals and a belief in animal rights might serve as a moral buffer so that when one group of people hate each other and begin to turn the other into animals, they will still have a step to go before they can begin the mass murders.It is in the second half when Szpilman goes into hiding that Polanski's film distinguishes itself. Here the focus is entirely on Szpilman and his need to survive. The cinematography of the Warsaw streets, the apartments he lives in, the snow, the gray buildings, the people below in the streets, the hunger, the music that he hears in his mind but cannot play, the burned-out buildings, and then the scene in which the German officer says, ""Play something"" and he does. It is here that the film becomes magical and a testament to the best that is in humans. Note that the pianist has become in his beard and his persecution a Christ-like figure who never raised a hand against anyone. He is the Christ who turned the other cheek. And note that it is his ethereal talent as a great musician that saves him. This is Polanski's message and the reason he made the film. The best that is in humans can rise above the brute that is in humans.See this for Adrien Brody, who gave it everything he had, and then some. His performance will haunt you. Polanski's clear, Hollywood-like, almost Spielbergian direction, tells the story a bit too brightly at times, and a bit too simplistically at others, but he has planned well so that in the end we see that he has told it brilliantly. See this because we need to be reminded of what can happen when we give way to hate and prejudice.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)","

"phiggins","5 February 2003","Roman Polanski's new movie, ""The Pianist"" is a truly gripping, devastating, heart-felt, unsentimental piece of work.  I urge you, if you have not seen it already, to do so before you read anything more about it (including this review).  You need to come to the film cold, as it were, knowing as little as possible in advance, so that its effect will be as powerful as possible. This is what I did.  I sat in the cinema, chatting quietly during the ads and trailers, preparing myself mentally for what I expected to be a reasonably harrowing but ultimately uplifting experience.  The film began. My initial reaction upon seeing Maureen Lipman and Frank Finlay was a slight smirk and a minor panic: Oh God, brit thesps over-doing it.  Nothing is more horrifying than the sight of Brit thesps over-doing it.  Or so I thought. Because shortly after this panic there was more to concern me.  Firstly, the Brit thesps were not over-doing it at all.  They were instead giving subtle, measured, moving performances.  How bizarre. Secondly, about ten minutes into the film, a gang of  nazis stroll into an apartment and casually drop a man from his wheelchair out over the balcony and onto the street below. This is all shown from the point of view of our heroes in the apartment opposite.  It all takes place in one long, agonising, heart-stopping take. The entire cinema gasps in horror.  All of a sudden we realise just how grim and unflinching this film is going to be.  From then on, things get worse (if that is at all possible) with horror piled upon horror in the most matter-of-fact way.  Bodies lie in the street.  Citizens of the ghetto bicker with each other over scraps of food, spill the food and then lick it up off the floor in desperation.  Nazi thugs (as opposed to all the nazi non-thugs...) force Jews to dance, shoot them in the head whenever they feel like it, drive over their dead bodies, etc. etc.  Then, as The Pianist's family is locked into the train carriage never to be seen again (the door slamming shut  on their screams) he is alone in this insane world, suddenly forced to survive.  He is not a good or bad person.  He is certainly not a hero.  If anything he is rather selfish and introverted.  Which only makes this film more realistic and moving.  We find ourselves imagining what it would be like to be in his situation.  What would we do? There is no point mourning the loss of loved ones.  That won't help anyone.  Nor is there any point fighting.  The Warsaw uprising begins (the fight scenes here are startlingly believable) and then ends in a rout by the nazis.  The Pianist watches from his hiding place several storeys above the city.  He is a detached observer rather than a participant.  He is, perhaps, even a coward, running away from, rather than confronting the enemy.  While working on the building gang he does get involved in helping the resistance, but escapes before the fighting begins.  All the time we think: what would I do?  We would probably do the same: Hide, run, survive. Defiantly avoiding sentimentality at all points, Polanski is in full command of his material here. Adrien Brody as our ""hero"" is superb.  His transformation from elegant, attractive man about town to shivering, starving, desperate wreck is an amazing performance.  Towards the end, as he hangs on to his tin of what? Some sort of fruit? with pathetic determination, he is a terrible vision of a man reduced to almost nothing. But still there is the spark in his eyes, and of course, as luck would have it, there is a piano.  Which is what saves him. And there is a coat, which almost gets him killed.  ""Why the fucking coat?""  ""Because I'm cold."" Note, by the way, that the line is not, ""Because I'm f***ing cold"" which would have been a nice gag, but fake.  ""Because I'm cold"" is achingly sad and small and true.  Like I said, Polanski and his screen-writer (the inestimable Ronald Harwood) are in full command of their material.  There is not a single false move, not a single mistake.  The film is beautiful and cold and terrible and sad and genuinely great.  Unlike that other holocaust movie to which it will no doubt be compared, ""Schindler's List"", this is not at Oscar-Machine, but a moving and honest portrayal of human cruelty and desperation.  It is also, in case you haven't worked it out already, a masterpiece.","

"gazzo-2","3 September 2003","........I don't have much to add onto what the others here have said-one of the things that struck me was how believable the passing of time. People have slow lives. People have to wait. Refugees hiding in an apt like he was are not exactly racing around to 77 different places in 4 days-they sit, they wait, they hide, they fear that the Nazis will come at any moment, and of course they wait some more. Wars take time. Being forced into a labor camp took time to get thru, slow agonizing months, weeks, days of it. Polanski knows this and shows it. If you want a Michael Bay style MTV jump and cut type editing kinda flick, go elsewheres. This subject matter and this era deserves, merits nothing less than what Polanski gives it.
**** believable as anything, kudos to them all for the oscar wins.","

"j-lacerra","3 August 2010","As a lifelong fan of movies and of Roman Polanski, I approached this movie with high expectations. I have seen a number of Holocaust movies, of varying quality: the great Schindler's List, the very good Triumph of the Spirit, and the absolutely despicable Life is Beautiful to name a few. I would have to place The Pianist in the middle somewhere.This beautifully shot and produced film unfortunately has no plot or story. The main character is a bland person in every way, with the exception of his musical abilities. And it is clearly due to these musical abilities that others are constantly helping him in the movie. Certainly not due to his personality or character, of which he has none. Adrien Brody stumbles through this picture like some carrot-beaked scarecrow, evoking no compassion from the audience for his fate, a fate that is considerably more fortunate than millions of other Jews in the period.Polanski created a wonderfully visual and accurate portrait of the time and place, but Brody created a mere shadow of a human being as its central character.","

"fred-287","9 February 2003","Before this movie, the top two that I'd seen about World War II and specifically the Holocaust were Lina Wertmueller's ""Seven Beauties"" and the original ""Jacob the Liar"" from the former East Germany.  (I haven't seen ""Schindler's List."")  Now there's a third.  ""Pianist"" shares some traits with the others.  One is that the German characters are not purely evil, although they do many evil things.  Another is that the non-German characters are not purely saintly.  (In ""Jacob,"" the least sentimental and in my view the best of the three, there's a scene with some young kids being brats, as young kids often are in real life.  This makes their impending death that much more compelling, knowing they'll never get the chance to grow out of their brattiness.)  In addition, all three films focus on guys who are not soldiers or war heroes, in fact the protagonist of ""Beauties"" was a Mafioso.  They're just trying to survive, even in a world that's gone nuts, because ultimately, that's all there is: the next breath, and then the one after it.The title character of the pianist has a comfortable life in prewar Warsaw and is so devoted to his musical career that when bombs start going off outside his recording studio, he's reluctant to quit playing.  We meet his family in their tastefully furnished home and see that they have as yet a dim notion of the realities of war, as they contemplate what to pack on the way to becoming refugees.  (One suspects Roman Polanski drew on his own background as well as that of the book by the real-life pianist.)  When they hear on the radio that Britain and France have declared war, they decide to stay put, naively assuming the foreign cavalry will come riding to the rescue.The brilliance of the early part of the film is the gradualness of the hardships imposed upon this family.  First it's one thing and then another, over a period of time.  This lets us see how it's human nature to keep adjusting to new and deteriorating conditions, always hoping things will improve or at least not get any worse.  An example is when they learn they will have to wear Jewish armbands in public.  A few protest they won't do it.  Later we see the father out in public with his armband.  Later still, they all have one. It never gets referred to again.  It just becomes another unpleasant fact of life.  So by the time all the Jews in the city are ordered into a walled-off section, we see how they've been ""eased into"" it; had the Nazis decreed a ghetto from day one, that probably would've spurred an uprising.Once in the ghetto, we see what anthropologists call a ""behavioral sink"" developing.  I found this the hardest part of the movie to take, even more so than the later battles and carnage.  It's not pleasant to watch kids dying in the street as adults walk past them, or to see a starving old man grab a bowl of gruel away from a starving old woman, then eat the spilled gruel off the street.  But these are realities that we don't usually get to see, even on CNN these days.  I don't know if Polanski has been accused of ""anti-Semitism"" but if he has been, it's probably due to these ghetto scenes, with some of the Jews living luxuriously (one guy in a cafe even orders the pianist to stop playing while he counts his money) while others starve, and some Jews working as police for the Nazis, and one character blaming their plight on American Jewish bankers not doing enough to get America into the war, etc.  But Polanski's point is that the Warsaw ghetto was a microcosm of human society in extreme conditions.  Sure they were oppressed because they were Jews but they suffered because they were human beings.  Polanski underlines this with a scene of a guy reading the famous Shylock speech in ""The Merchant of Venice.""  Fortunately such editorializing is kept to a minimum.By the time the Jews are rounded up to be put on board the cattle car trains, they're so beaten down we see why they don't rise up and storm the guards (as one character suggests).  It would be pointless anyway, and there's still that next breath to take, and the next one. At the last minute the pianist gets yanked out of line by a semi-friendly Jewish cop; his family members get shoved into the train and he never sees them again, there's no time for tearful farewells.  For the remainder of the movie we see the pianist mostly hiding out.The brilliance in this part is how rigidly Polanski sticks to the protagonist's point of view.  Whatever horrible things are occurring, we only see what he sees.  Some may be disappointed we don't see more of the armed uprising in the ghetto, for instance, which the pianist watches through the window of the hidden apartment he's occupying.  But it's crucial that this remain HIS story.  As we watch people getting killed at a distance, we even feel some relief we're not closer to it, which is how he must have felt.  Guilt, maybe, but definitely relief too.  There's still the next breath, and the one after that.
POSSIBLE SPOILERS FROM HERE ONWARDS
The narrative became a little disjointed in the movie's latter part; it wasn't always clear when things were occurring, or why, or who were all these various people in the pianist's life, but probably that was also deliberate, illustrating his state of mind as he became ever more detached from the events unfolding around him.  The pianist focusses on the essentials: food, and breathing.  His existence becomes almost purely reactive: if there's food, eat it; if there's danger, flee from it. Only the memory of his music reminds him of his personhood.  In a scene where he's secreted with a piano and advised to remain silent, I actually thought for a moment he was going to play it, but of course, the survival instict wins out.  Instead he plays a kind of ""air piano.""Eventually the war comes right into his face in the form of a tank; there's great use of sound after a shell tears through a wall near him, I could actually feel my ears ringing.  He's back in the street, seemingly the only living person in an endless cityscape of blasted buildings.  In an abandoned hospital he finds a can of vegetables which he carries religiously for most of the rest of the movie.  Finally he finds an empty house that even has a piano in it---and lo and behold, a German officer regarding him quizzically. This was also a real-life character who helped the pianist survive.  In the movie it's not clear why, although we see a photo of the officer's family on his desk and he refers to God at one point; the actor is very good and subtle and I had no problem accepting what was occurring, but this was the only part of the movie with elements that reminded me of other movies, such as the ""good"" German in ""The Keep,"" or the scene in Ralph Bakshi's animated ""American Pop"" with the American playing piano for the dying German.  (I half expected the pianist in this movie to play ""Lilli Marlene"" or something for the officer.)  Another minor problem is that the introduction of this ""good German"" at the end draws our focus away from the pianist.  We start wondering what happened to the German after the war, and there are some onscreen words to tell us.  But I think it would have been better if the German had just come and gone, like everyone else over the course of the film.  It should have been another ""brick in the wall"" of the pianist's story of survival.Many individual scenes stick in the memory; if I had to single one out, it would be when a German officer randomly pulls guys out of a group, has them lie down and then calmly walks along shooting each one in the head.  When he gets to the last guy, he has to reload.  While watching the doomed guy's face in his last few seconds I thought ""What the hell would I be thinking in his place?  Would I try a last desperate lunge, or just wait for the inevitable?""Adrien Brody has to carry the movie and does an admirable job, especially in the early scenes when he has to grapple with an increasingly untenable situation.  Later on, the physicality of the role takes over somewhat, as he becomes gaunt, shaggy, shivering and dazed.  But at the end when he's back to a ""normal"" postwar life (or is it?) there's a residual sadness in his face as he plays.  Fine acting all around (the woman seeking her missing husband was just a little on the hokey side) but I wish a decision had been made about the accents, viz. ""Okay, in this movie English is actually Polish but we're going to use English accents.""   Fastidiously realistic sets and locations.  The black and white footage at the beginning included a statue then seen periodically throughout,  a nice anchoring touch.
Definitely not a popcorn flick, no emotional surge at the end a la ""Saving Private Ryan.""  Should it matter to anyone that Mr. Szpilman survived the war and lived to a ripe old age?  (Would it matter if any one of us did?) One may even wonder what the point of it all was .... a question worth pondering as we seem to be on the way to another war ....""Szpilman"" means ""player,"" for those wondering about the German officer's remark that it's a good name for a pianist.","

"TaylorYee94","25 February 2021","Szpilman's life is just hard to watch. Nazis make him not only hungry and sick but also humiliated and wretched, taking away his family, talents, personality, and even humanity. Military officers force Jews to dance on the street with strangers, whip workers 'to celebrate New Year', and mount & burn dead bodies and leave that heap of ashes as it is. Hopelessness and fear in Jews' eyes leave audience with deeper sorrow and anger against Nazis because these scenes display how Nazis view Jews, not human .. with inferiority. However, against all the difficulties and unfair & unjust treatment, Szpilman always strives to live and go on. His struggles though sad and inhumane because he has to walk away from his family tells that the life as hell is still more worth than the death, the end. After realizing this, his life looks even beautiful.I want to give more credits to screenwriting than directing. With phenomenal life real-figure Szpilman had to live and barbarian historical background, WWII, the director does not need to do much. The scriptwriter does a great job summarizing Szpilman's whole experience during World War II into 150 minutes, no embellishment, very straightforward but still captivating. It is not easy to take a few key events and concentrate on those. Many films adapted from the books often make mistakes of trying to put everything in one basket, a very small one with time limit. The narrative is also very well balanced between simplicity and complexity, many dynamic turn of events but still not distracted from the main story line.The director appropriately combines first-person pov with third-person pov. He follows protagonist's journey, and we can see his growth, realization, and feelings on the way. At the same time, through media such as window, people talking, and turn of the camera, we can also realize what happens in surrounding society and world, holding Nazi accountable for war crime. Cinematography emphasizes human's empty effort for power and greed. Among bombed-down buildings full of debris, Szpilman stands alone, so small like a speck in a distance. In reverse, he stands alone after everything is destroyed, showing his strength, perseverance, and resilience.My favorite scenes are two both when Szpilman plays piano in the air but in different places. The first one is at hiding place, trying to remain quiet not to get caught. The second one is at the wrecked hospital at the abyss of misery. Those two scenes symbolize the whole movie. Szpilman torn between reality and ideal has lost pleasure of playing piano which makes him who he is and his hope. Ironically, playing piano even in the air raises his hope amidst disasters and desolation.","

"erikgloor","29 January 2003","It's not that this is yet another film about the holocaust. Hard though they may be to watch, when you have one of the most horrific real-life nightmares perpetrated on a completely innocent community as you had in the Warsaw Ghetto situation, films will be made and should be made about it. This happened just 60 years ago, but it's right out of some dark ages tale of Vlad the Impaler or something -- innocents rounded up and slaughtered wholesale for no reason whatsoever -- just because they could be. Just to satisfy some twisted despot's profane sense of reality. If anything, more films should be made about the holocaust.Unfortunately, when films are made about this most sad episode of the 20th century, the tendency to celebrate each film equally understandably arises. No one wants to accidentally align themselves with the few warped minds who suggest it never happened or that it should have happened by saying anything bad about a film about the holocaust. But, in the hope of encouraging good films about the horror the Nazis inflicted, I will now attempt to do just that.What I loathed about this film was that the Nazis were the most interesting part of it. Our hero is a nice man who plays the piano very well. There are some other nice people who help him. His family is nice. But even the most interesting act of benevolence in the picture is performed by a Nazi officer.What was Polanski thinking? Story! Story! Story!Beware, the following paragraph is a total *** SPOILER ***Honest to God, here is the plot that unravels over two and a half mind-numbing hours: A Jewish piano player narrowly escapes when the Nazis take over Poland and evacuate all the Jews to death camps. He waits around doing very little in particular until the Russians come and ""liberate"" Poland. That's it. That's the entire plot. True though it may be, truth is not always stranger than fiction. Sometimes, it's downright boring. The truth, for example, is that I got out of bed this morning and came to work. True, yes. But dull, definitely.This film is a total snoozerama! I kept waiting for our piano player to join the resistance and take out a few Nazis; or have an interesting relationship with one of his benefactors; or carve a piano into a hang-glider and fly to Allied territory. Something. Anything! Instead we are treated to long, long scenes of our hero fiddling about in empty apartments or sifting through rubble for a bite to eat or having rather ordinary conversations with his family or those who help him.I mean, on some level, I get it -- he's the penultimate victim and survivor and artist; somehow immune to the violence because of the sublime expression in his fingers. But THAT is a half-hour short subject film AND NOT a two-and-a-half hour feature film. It just isn't. It's just damned rude to suggest otherwise.Damned rude.This movie review by Erik Gloor","

"Sanou_san","28 June 2012","Had to be top achievement of Adrien Brody, and I never doubt the pinnacle of his performance for this. Set again the old ages of the 20th century this film made me recall Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" ringing in my head. It was as heartrending, fearful, expressive and disastrous as the characters of Spielberg's film experienced, though in a different view of course. This film again showed us the misery of innocent people experienced in the hands of vile Germany. But then it left me a room to think in my head that not everything of Germany is as vile as the mainstream thinks. It's the same lesson I picked when watching Schindler's List. And the suffering of the protagonist opened once more parts of life you never thought would happen to anyone. And there are so many things you would never thought of letting go or letting it happen before your eyes and conscience. Such burden and misfortune one has to carry just to survive, Adrien's character lived up to that. We saw it, the struggle and transformation. It was the beauty this film carried, no wonder that for me an Oscar is not ample enough to appreciate the brilliance of human experience excellently told to the mass.Funny it is when my brother's girlfriend recommended me this film and after watching it, I can't get over it. I was even impressed to myself when I shared it to my officemate that she told me how vivid my recollections where. I can't explain it, but probably because of my craving for a beautiful story made me grasp the film in just one go. Just like ""Joyeux Noel"" an opposite of this film, though with same worldly issues and situations, strengthened my attachment to them.There so much to tell about this film and I'm really looking forward for the book the film is based. There so much of the detail probably I've missed but the film is brilliant enough to compress those in my opinion.",NA
"crooked_spoons","18 December 2009","Sadly, The Pianist disappointed me in more ways than one. Adrian Brody did nothing worthwhile, other than save his own skin—and there's nothing wrong with that, I'm sure thousands of Jews did the same. The problem is, I don't care about them either. The Holocaust was a horrible, atrocious, sickening series of events which left millions dead, wounded and mentally scarred. We know this, and I don't mean to brush off anything or downplay the gravity of what occurred, but I've seen it all before.There was some senseless killing of Jews, more senseless killing of Jews, liquidation and a salvation. Nothing more, nothing less. I'm sadly reminded that if an event is horrible enough, people will continue to laud and applaud movies made about it even if they have nothing new to say.Call Brody's acting whatever lovely adjectives you want (minimalist, subdued, etc) but to me, it was bland and forgettable. Don't get me wrong, I think Brody is a tremendous actor, but in THIS movie, I didn't see a man who was scared, nor determined to fight for his life or to see things through, instead, I saw a man who was just going through the motions, ""whatever happens, happens"" in a way. He was neither brave nor memorable and certainly not relatable.I didn't care about him, his family and in the end, none of the characters. And I didn't feel even the slightest hint of emotion. The only time I was even remotely roused was when Halina (I think her name was Halina) was reunited with the family after the second liquidation of the ghetto.In the end, Pianist gives little more than a tired rehash of the same old same old. Things were badI know! But if you're going to make yet another Holocaust film, at least do it right, make it interesting, make it meaningful, make it SAY something. This said nothing more than, ""Look how bad things were."" In the end, his ability to play the piano saved his life, in a way, or it was merely a weary Nazi officer who showed him mercy.If you want to see a real holocaust movie, one need only turn to Schindler's List. I felt, I mean *really* felt, the characters pain and emotional conflict. The book was incredible as well. It was well made and had an actual plot. Not just a broad story arc where nothing other than the ""usual"" happened.-Just because it's a Holocaust film, doesn't automatically make it good.",NA
"Ben_Cheshire","2 April 2004","No other medium in the world has the power to illustrate for us what life would have been like in certain periods of the past but the cinema. One of the most important periods to not let go forgotton is the massacre and repression of Jews in Germany and occupied europe. If war and racism led to people to be killed like dogs and worse, simply for belonging to a certain group, then everyone should know about it, in my opinion, to keep history from repeating itself, and to make sure they didn't die for nothing. Don't turn your back on it - stare this movie in the face and look at what racism and intolerance can lead humans to do to other humans.Scene after scene of such penetrating truth and honesty encapsulate in cinematic episodes the horrors committed by the Nazis, the state of desperation of the Jews and many other aspects of this horrible ordeal, based on the personal memoirs of the main character, famed Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman.It was based on the memoirs of Szpilman, which means we know he survives the war, and it was marketed with this in mind, as a survival story. And this, of course, is the main attraction to this movie: not to put oneself through experiencing the horrors of war, which i nevertheless believe is important, but of finding out how in heck a Jew living in Nazi occupied Poland could have survived, and as such it is a remarkable story of hope and courage against unbelievable odds. And not one calculated by a Hollywood studio to manipulate you - this stuff really happened, and to the character portrayed in this movie by Adrian Brody. Some of it also happened to Roman Polanski himself, which made this a very personal project for him.As i mentioned at the beginning, this movie demonstrates the power of cinema, and one of its central themes is the power of the arts, particularly music, to affect people, to make them feel.",NA

Its a powerful story of determination, hope, freedom and pride.He loses his family, has his religion disgraced, but he survives This continuous film is a superb study in how the holocaust developed and how much it devastated the Jewish community of Poland in world war 2.Although people may say that schindlers list is undoubtedly superior, they are very different films. One is a study a jew in the holocaust and the other is a study of a German in the holocaust. Schindlers List is stylistically superior but The Pianist manages to form a vision of how the holocaust developed and increasingly devastated an innocent Jewish family.It also presents other elements of the holocaust such as the extermination of disabled people in which a group of Nazis is shown raiding a Jewish home, a person in a wheelchair is tipped over a balcony, the rest of the family are then murdered. This is one of the most depressing and dark scenes of cinema i have ever seen, the fact that Szpilman's family is watching the whole thing with horror, makes you be able to empathise with the situation they are in and therefore maximises mental devastation to the watcher.Although i didn't cry in the film, it is still a harrowing masterpiece and any faint hearted person would be extremely moved by the film.9/10",NA

Some moments were so heavy that I was not even able to cry, I just simply suffered wathing the main character's misery. Another thing I noticed, and liked, in the film is that some Nazis (specially Captain Hosenfeld) were presented in a positive way that I have not seen in any movie about the WW2 before, it just proves that some of them contained humanity. Also, needless to say but I will say it anyway, the acting game was at a spectacular level.

"vladymirror","29 August 2003","This is going to be a difficult review as difficult and disturbing the movie ""The Pianist"" was. Even though our world is saturated with crime and violence I still had close my eyes for some of the scenes in this movie. At one point I thought that it was too much. I have seen many, many movies about the WW2, but a have never seen violence in such a blunt way. One has to be in a lot of pain to be able to make such a movie, which is pretty much the case with Mr. Polanski.The movie tells the true story of a man who survives the holocaust by pure chance, luck, stoicism, and the good will of few good people. Or maybe everything was just a fate. Don't expect to see a hero or fighter kind of story. No, he is just a man fighting for his own survival. This is not a thriller. I knew that there would be a scene where the pianist is supposed to play for a German solder so I was looking forward to seeing it. I wanted to see the direction of the scene, the acting of them both (the pianist and the officer), and of course, hear the music. Well, it was a breathtaking experience. See it for yourself P.S. At the end I think that the Russians a very much in debt to that genre-movies dealing with the WW2. They used to make such a great movies about the war, but not anymore.

"rexmatthewj","22 April 2023","The Pianist is a powerful and moving biographical war drama film directed by Roman Polanski and starring Adrien Brody as Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish-Jewish pianist who survived the Holocaust in Warsaw. The film is based on Szpilman's memoir of the same name, which recounts his harrowing experiences of hiding, starving, and witnessing the atrocities committed by the Nazis and their collaborators. The film won three Academy Awards, including Best Director for Polanski, Best Adapted Screenplay for Ronald Harwood, and Best Actor for Brody.The film begins with Szpilman playing live on the radio in 1939, when the German invasion of Poland interrupts his performance. He and his family are soon forced to move into the Warsaw Ghetto, where they face hunger, disease, humiliation, and violence. Szpilman manages to escape deportation to the Treblinka death camp with the help of a Jewish policeman, but he loses contact with his family and friends. He then begins a desperate struggle for survival, moving from one hiding place to another, with the aid of some sympathetic Poles and Jews. Along the way, he witnesses the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the Warsaw Uprising, as well as the brutal suppression of both by the Germans. He also encounters a German officer named Wilm Hosenfeld, who spares his life and helps him find food and shelter.The Pianist is a masterful film that depicts the horrors of war and genocide without sensationalizing or exploiting them. Polanski, who himself survived the Krakow Ghetto as a child, creates a realistic and immersive atmosphere that transports the viewer to the time and place of the events. He also avoids any overt political or moral commentary, letting the images and sounds speak for themselves. The film is not only a testament to Szpilman's courage and resilience, but also a tribute to the human spirit and dignity that can endure even in the most inhumane conditions.Brody delivers an outstanding performance as Szpilman, conveying his emotions and thoughts with minimal dialogue and subtle gestures. He portrays Szpilman's transformation from a confident and talented musician to a broken and terrified man with remarkable authenticity and sensitivity. He also lost 30 pounds for the role, adding to his physical resemblance to Szpilman. The supporting cast is equally impressive, especially Thomas Kretschmann as Hosenfeld, who shows compassion and remorse despite being part of the Nazi regime.The film also features a beautiful and haunting score by Wojciech Kilar, which includes some of Chopin's piano pieces played by Szpilman himself or by Brody. The music adds to the emotional impact of the film, as well as to its artistic value. The cinematography by Pawel Edelman is also stunning, capturing the contrast between the dark and gloomy interiors of the hiding places and the bright and colorful exteriors of Warsaw before and after the war.The Pianist is a film that deserves to be seen by anyone who appreciates cinema as an art form and as a medium for telling stories that matter. It is not only a historical document, but also a universal story of survival, hope, and humanity.",NA
"Captain_Couth","30 July 2005","The Pianist (2002) was Roman Polanski's most personal film to date and an acting tour de force for Adrian Brody. The movie takes place during World War II. A brilliant pianist is forced to live like an animal during the war. Since he's of Jewish heritage, his family and others that have been ""branded"" with the star of David are forced to life in concentration camps and ghettos. But this film is not about this topic, that has been beaten to death already. The PIanist is about surviving and keeping one's head together just so they could live another day. Adrian Brody was quite impressive as the Pianist. He conveyed emotion and acting on a level that I never thought he could have ever attained. Roman Polanski's direction was razor sharp and he creates an environment that felt so authentic and real.In many ways the Pianist also reflects upon the life of Roman Polanski. He has been in the same situations before and has experienced life in the ghettos and camps.

Some men might call statutory rape Getting Lucky but generally not when the girl is 13, definitely not if the girl is drugged-up by the assailant in order to assure her co-operation. I say it's reprehensible and Mr. Polanksi needs to return to face his crime.THE PIANIST is the very personal story of Szpilmann and his ordeal in surviving the Warsaw Ghetto -- which 95% did not survive; the awful events of that time compellingly told in an on-the-level manner not seen before in any of the hundreds of films dealing with World War II with focus on the Jews.That's the trouble, the focus is too often on the Jews. Young people today think the whole war was about the Jews. It wasn't. In Warsaw, while the Germans were killing Jews in the Ghetto, they were killing non-Jews not in the Ghetto in greater numbers. About 90% of the victims of Germany's invasion of Poland were Catholic. Where are the movies about Catholics? In Warsaw, one of the historic Catholic churches had been converted into a hospital. When the Germans arrived they at once massacred everybody in the hospital including the medical staff and buried everyone alive or dead by exploding the building. Nope, it wasn't just Jews.Szpilman is certainly entitled to have his story told, but taken in the larger context of too many World War II films telling about the Jews (8 million dead) and ignoring the 80 million others, it plays like propaganda.",NA
"Toph-22","6 January 2021","The pianist shows very impressively how people lived respectively suffered at that time. Unimaginable suffering and injustice is done to the people. Life is restricted for no reason. Access to cafes, a visit to the park or sitting on a bench, supposedly self-evident things are forbidden.In retrospect, these restrictions seem almost trivial. The movie shows how the lives of Jewish people gradually become worse and worse. Of course you know where it's going, but that's what gives it even more intensity. Always in the middle, Wladyslaw Szpilman, who tries as far as possible not to attract attention. What other choice do you have if you want to survive. Those who resist or breathe too loudly in the wrong place die. With all his strength and willpower, he lets everything wash over him.Bombing of the immediate neighborhood, up-close shootings and starving people represent everyday life. People are arbitrarily humiliated and harassed. People are grasping at any straw for a bit of hope to get out of this hell alive.The movie does not spare cruelty and shows it consistently. Downplaying would also be the wrong thing to do here. People live in constant fear and you can feel that at all times. The movie primarily follows the lives of the people up close and gives rather little insights into the regime itself. In the ghetto itself, you see how people deal with the events in different ways. Desperation, fear, pure hatred and those who just try not to stand out.Overall, the movie addresses a part of history that must never be forgotten. Of course, you cannot image how bad it really was for the people, but the movie impressively conveys a feeling for it. But through movies of this kind, you always recall these chapters of history in your mind and they make you think about it.Definitely watch it.",NA
"george.schmidt","30 December 2002","THE PIANIST (2002) **** Adrien Brody gives the performance of his career as brilliant pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew, who miraculously survived the aftermath of the Nazis' relentless takeover of the Warsaw ghetto, where he hid for years and ultimately the only surviving member of his doomed family, at the height of WWII in Europe.  Filmmaker Roman Polanski delivers his most intimate and compelling work in years (Polanski himself is a Holocaust survivor who experienced intense loss) filtering his own life experiences into his dogged protagonist with all-too painful and assertively unflinching portrait of an exceptionally gifted musician in an unending nightmare replete with graphic violence that comes without warning, hope in the least likely forms and ultimately triumph in the face of evil. One of the best films about the Holocaust and one of the best films of the year as well.",NA
"Wuchakk","19 October 2015","Released in 2002, ""The Pianist"" is Roman Polanski's account of the real-life Hebrew pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) whose family was banished to the Warsaw ghetto with thousands of other Jews after the German invasion. Szpilman is separated from his family members when they're carted off to be slaughtered and does whatever he must to survive until the Allies defeat Germany. He's dependent on others while hiding out and, like they say, sometimes help comes from the most unexpected sources.Like 1993's ""Schindler's List,"" ""The Pianist"" is a thoroughly realistic WWII drama that addresses the Holocaust with flashes of violence and atrocities, only marred by the stereotypical boorish depiction of practically every member of the Wehrmacht. Needless to say, you have to be in the right mode for a movie like this and you have to be willing to invest a solid hour before things get interesting; by the final hour you'll be hooked until the end; that is, unless you have ADHD and consume only cartoony ""blockbusters.""Some have complained that Szpilman's a lousy protagonist for this type of movie because he never does anything heroic and essentially waits it out. Answer: That's why it's called ""The Pianist"" and not ""The Warrior Jew"" or ""Rambo 5: Kraut Killer."" He was a simple musician who did what he could to survive, but that's not all he does; he also smuggles weapons into the ghetto, which are used later in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. When he eventually hides out in various apartments he doesn't have a weapon. What's he supposed to do, run into the streets and take on German soldiers by himself with a club or a kitchen knife? Even going out with a machine gun would've been foolish and suicidal. Szpilman's a survivor who does some minor heroic things. For those who demand a more standout hero, look no further than Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann); he's the hero of the story. The movie effectively shows the pianist's view of the war, which is the window through which the viewer observes the historical events. ""Schindler's List"" shows the Holocaust through the eyes of a Gentile who observes the machinery of the Holocaust from the top and views both Nazis and Jews from a position of safety. Oskar Schindler naturally had a more panoramic, birds-eye view of the Holocaust whereas ""The Pianist"" shows the Holocaust through the eyes of a Jew who observes the machinery of the Holocaust from the bottom and sees both Nazis and Jews from a position of danger. The former is a better film for understanding the machinery of the Holocaust while ""The Pianist"" is a better film to watch if you want to know what it was like to experience the Holocaust first hand as an ordinary Jew.The movie runs 2½ hours and was shot in Poland (including Warsaw where the events in the movie take place) and Germany.

"anaconda-40658","19 June 2015","The Pianist (2002): Dir: Roman Polanski / Cast: Adrien Brody, Thomas Kretschmann, Frank Finley, Maureen Lipman, Emilia Fox: Very powerful and emotionally driven film about the dreaded affects of Warsaw. In symbolic terms it regards our condition under huge duress as when Adrien Brody moves his fingers through the air and the audiences hears the beautiful sounds of the piano that are only evident in his tarnished mind. His family was separated from him and we can sense his loneliness as he walks a street littered with bodies and fallen structures. He is forced to help rebuild a separation wall as well as endure brutal treatment from the Nazis. Directed by Roman Polanski who himself is a survivor of such conditions, and his passion for the material is evident. His previous films contain such classics as Chinatown and Repulsion. He creates the nightmarish atmosphere of the period and succeeds with great results. Flawless acting by Brody whose grief is only subsided by the sounds of piano. Strong supporting work by Thomas Kretschmann as a German soldier who happens upon him and the interesting situation that transpires as a result. Frank Finley, Maureen Lipman as his parents are more or less obvious in terms of their fate. We can feel the anguish and his sense of longing as the cherished strokes of the piano keys reflect his memory. Score: 9 / 10",NA
"Sylviastel","20 July 2019","Roman Polanski was a holocaust survivor. He directed perhaps the most important film about the period based on the true story of Wladislaw Szpilman, a Polish Jewish pianist, who survived on his own strength with the help of his friends and even a German soldier who helped him in the end. The film is based on the true story. They're were horrible events that actually happened in the Warsaw Ghetto. Warsaw today was built upon the ruins of World War II. Adrien Brody was well honored with an Academy Award. The supporting cast was excellent with Frank Finlay and Maureen Lipman as his parents. Roman Polanski is the best person to direct a film about the Holocaust and even from his own experiences. This film is perhaps Polanski's best film and most personal of all.",NA
"JohnDeSando","10 January 2003","Jerzy Kosinski wrote of a boy escaping all over Europe from Nazi oppressors in his classic `Painted Bird,' an alleged autobiography influenced by Roman Polanski's flight as a boy.  Polanski's `The Pianist,' based on a true story in the Warsaw ghetto in 1939, is also said to be autobiographical if you substitute `film director' for the `pianist.""  Kosinski's dramatic situations, memorable right down to the lantern he carries everywhere, are tense and frenetic, even though he is frequently hiding.  Polanski's Polish Jew Szpilman, a concert pianist, just hides, leaving only the powerful first third for the drama and character delineation-the rest is hiding and grubbing for food.  Polanski's flight in Krakow and Warsaw helped Kosinski tell his story; Szpilman's autobiography helped Polanski tell `The Pianist' story.In the first part of the film, Polanski expertly shows us the family of the pianist in a state of quiet decline and denial while the Germans overtake Warsaw and move Jews to the ghetto and eventually `work' camps.  Szpilman's brother is fiery and irresponsible but devoted to overthrowing the Nazis. By contrast, Szpilman passively allows others to save him, usually due to his acclaim as a classical pianist.  That he plays Chopin beautifully attests to why he should be revered and maybe saved.  Yet, Polanski may inadvertently show him to be self-centered when he lets others take great risks to save him, when he watches from his safe window fellow Jews of the resistance being slaughtered, and when he does not fully join the resistance.  Or Polanski may be expressing the anguish and self-loathing of one whose mother did not survive the gas chamber.Except for `Charlotte Gray,' I haven't recently seen a better depiction of the fatally flawed resistance against Germans than in this film.  Polanski has done a credible job showing there was resistance at great peril and price.  He also creates a bombed-out, ruined Warsaw that looks real enough to make the audience catch their breath.Polanski also includes a Platonic admiration between Szpilman and the lovely wife of a friend and supporter-here Polanski is at his `Chinatown' best showing the heartache and natural shocks fortune visits on lovers in war (Think also of Rick and Ilsa in `Casablanca').  By the end, Szpilman is looking more like Tom Hanks in `Cast Away' than Arthur Rubenstein.  The hero is back where he started; I hope the world has progressed beyond that.",NA
"blott2319-1","20 March 2020","I'm just going to bite the bullet and say something that is potentially quite ugly and offensive, so I'll apologize in advance for how this makes me sound. I've seen enough of the Holocaust. I know it was probably the ugliest and most horrendous moments in humanity's history. I know that Nazis did unspeakably awful things to Jews. I know that life for anyone Jewish was unbearable, for however long they could keep their lives. But over the years I've seen so many films on the subject, my emotional reserves have been used up. I couldn't muster a tear for Wladyslaw Szpilman's struggle, and almost feel like I've become desensitized to scenes of Jews being carted off to concentration camps or shot in the streets. My brain still sees the horror and hates that this was reality, but my heart has been drowned in similar shots in countless movies to the point where it can't continue to break every time I see it. In fact, I just watched a couple of similar films based on the true stories of Jews fleeing the Holocaust within the last month, so perhaps it was just bad timing.I think the other reason that The Pianist didn't connect with me as well as any number of similar stories is the passive role that Szpilman plays in his own story. In many ways he is merely an observer of what happens. His story is about fleeing, watching, and others helping him. Once his family is removed from the equation, we don't form much of a bond with anyone else we see suffering. I'm not suggesting he did anything wrong, in fact his story is quite impressive. However, when I've seen films about people inside the concentration camps, or forced to endure heinous acts of cruelty, it's hard to be as impacted by a guy who is hiding. I hope this doesn't make me sound too much like a monster, and I certainly didn't hate The Pianist. In fact, I was looking forward to hearing him play more, because the actual music was marvelous. It's impossible to be bored by a movie like this, because there's always some new horrible thing around the corner. I guess my standards for movies in this genre have just been raised too much, and it will take something truly original or outstanding to hit me with the power of Holocaust movies that came before.",NA
"coldwaterpdh","21 October 2008","""The Pianist"" was a breath of fresh air for me. It has been a long time since I've seen a film this refreshing. I regret not seeing it sooner and if you haven't seen it, I recommend doing so.Painting a ultra-realistic portrait of one man's life during the darkest period in the 20th century, Polanski masterfully and easily shows what he can do with the right kind of brush I have always enjoyed his films; ""Rosemary's Baby"" being one of my all time favorite movies. But ""The Pianist"" is very different. It is quite serious and disturbing while not being gratuitous. The violence shown here is very sickening but it is never overly graphic. It is not exploitative, as it well shouldn't be. It is heart wrenching to say the least. Adrien Brody confidently commands the respect of the viewer in what has to be the role of his career. He definitely deserved the Oscar he got for this one.In short, every human being alive should see this film. It is unbiased, extremely effective and completely genuine. I never doubted for a moment that Roman's heart wasn't in it. Totally timeless and classic. See it!!! 10 out of 10, kids.",NA
"arthur_tafero","26 January 2023","The Pianist is Adrien Brody's role of a lifetime. He will most likely never encounter a script or role as good as this one. The director Roman Polanski, has a good grasp of the emotional devastation caused by the Nazis in WW 2 Poland. This film depicts one survivor of the horrors that were present in the city of Warsaw during that unfortunate period.The survivor is a talented pianist, played by Brody, who plays upon the sensibilities of the German officer who is in charge of the entire city. Szpilman, the pianist portrayed in this film, is living like an animal, under the boarding of a piece of furniture in the officer's office. He crawls under it to sleep at night, and only comes out for food and water during the daytime, as well as playing a piano that is in the office. It is this talent that keeps him alive, and out of the concentration camps that killed millions during this horrendous conflict.If this film does not affect you from an emotional standpoint, may I suggest you see a psychoanalyst, because you may be suffering from sensory deprivation.

It's a man's personal history of how he survived the Holocaust. It's not the typical holocaust movie. ""The Pianist"" sheds a very important light on the atrocities happening outside of the Jewish ghetto and outside of the concentration camps. Many atrocities and many monstrosities continued to happen every day outside of all these places. Strong images, great craftsmanship from Polanski. A very expressive Adrien Brody in the pinacle of his career. Very powerful, poetic scenes, my favourite being the piano scene by the end of the movie. A very well crafted movie, a journey through hell and back. I really wonder how have I never watched this movie before. An absolute cinematic wonder!",NA

"LydiaOLydia","25 August 2006","The Pianist is a by the numbers movie about the life and times of a pianist trying to live through the Nazi occupation of Warsaw. A beautiful musical score predictably results. The pianist himself is an altogether unsympathetic character - we want him to live because we don't want to be cruel, but otherwise we wouldn't have any particular attraction to this man. The movie itself is strictly, for the most part, paint by numbers. Nazis are bad, Jews are innocent yet determined survivors. Well, more to the point, Nazis are bad, though deep down inside they appreciate fine culture and some of them have good hearts. The Soviets, on the other hand, are uniformly bad and stupid, it seems.The lessons of the Holocaust must never be forgotten. However, the pivotal lessons of the Holocaust are not ""Nazis are bad Jews are innocent yet determined survivors."" Those sort of lessons are historical details along the lines of ""The Magna Carta was signed in 1066."" The real lessons of the Holocaust center around what happens when we stop looking at each other as human beings and start looking at each other as cartoons or stereotypes. This is a by the numbers movie specifically because it does what most movies do - it starts with existing cartoon/stereotype views and builds characters around them to tell a story. A better movie would have begun in that place, but then used the power and magic of film to challenge our preconceptions and our stereotypes to truly convey and reinforce a message of hope for humanity.Your life will not be any poorer if you never see this movie, but you won't feel that you wasted your time, either, if you do. Certainly doesn't belong in the IMDb Top 250.",NA
"panchodh_12","20 July 2015","Soundtrack for this review: El pianista del gueto de Varsovia by Jorge DrexlerIt is hard to review this movie. It is not easy to evaluate this movie in terms of its acting, its quality, its directing, with an armchair attitude that ignores the crudeness and harshness of real life. It is hard to say phrases like ""Roman Polanski, perhaps due to its own experience, captures perfectly the feeling of everyday life of Polish Jews during the Second World War, its sadness and despair but also the tiny moments of hope"", however true that might be.It is very hard to rate this just as a movie, and not as a reminder for the human race of what are we capable of. I'm often reluctant to watch Holocaust movies because I know beforehand that they will have very hard to digest moments, and they are almost an act of masochism, two hours of intense suffering. But they are necessary, they are real stories that urge to be told, and need to be heard so that they don't happen again.In a world where islamophobic parties are winning votes in Europe, where Americans proudly wave a flag that is the symbol of slavery in front of their president, these movies are indispensable. We cannot allow ourselves to fall into the collective madness that Germany fell into between 1933 and 1945. We should have learnt by now that technology has allowed the State to mobilize way too many resources, and the extermination of an entire group of people is only a button away. Not to mention the fact that these things still happen in more remote corners of the world, where they don't destabilize global geopolitics. So it would be too frivolous from my side to evaluate Polanski's direction or Brody's acting, as if this was fiction. The feeling I have after having watched The Pianist is not the one of a film critic that passively observes reality from behind his desk, but an active one, the imperative of making sure that nothing like this ever happens again.",NA

"jboothmillard","10 July 2006","From Oscar BAFTA winning director Roman Polanski, and based on a true story, this is the great story of one man's struggle to survive, and also his passion of playing the piano.

He and his family, including Father (Frank Finlay) and Mother (Maureen Lipman) are threatened and ordered about by the Nazi Germans to obey their commands, otherwise by shot.

"fernandoschiavi","25 December 2022","The plot is based on the autobiography of Wladyslaw Szpilman (1911-2000), one of the 400 thousand Jews who lived in Warsaw and who were summarily massacred when Germany invaded Poland, in 1939. Confinement of his family and his Polish peers in the city's so-called ""Ghetto"", suffered in the face of racist norms imposed by the Nazi army, escaped the consequent extermination and survived as a dying man in the rubble of the city until the end of World War II, in 1945.Written by Ronald Harwood based on Szpilman's autobiographical book, The Pianist begins precisely at the moment when Germany invades Poland and begins enacting anti-Semitic laws: at first, Jews are prohibited from walking on the city's sidewalks (in this case, Warsaw) and to sit on benches in the squares. They are then forced to wear sashes bearing the Star of David on their arms and are later 'deposited' in the Warsaw ghetto. It is in this context that we meet the pianist's family: cultured and relatively wealthy, the Szpilmans believe that Germany will soon be defeated, since France and England have just declared war on Hitler. Thus, it is with great terror that they end up submitting themselves to the constant humiliations imposed by the Nazis as they fight to remain united - and these humiliations seem to have no end, since the German military seems willing to carry out new atrocities at all times, as in the scene where they interrupt a family's dinner and, to avoid the trouble of carrying an invalid down the stairs, decide to throw him out of the window.Another sequence of scenes depicts the horrors of that time. A boy in despair calls out for his father, who is in his lap, dead for many hours, given the livor mortis already marking his skin. Jews are humiliated in the public square by Nazi soldiers. A boy is saved by the protagonist when trying to cross the ghetto wall, being beaten until he passes out. The worst scene, however, takes place on a night when several Jews are killed without any mercy, leaving their bodies disgraced in the middle of the street. We see Polish Jews being uprooted from their homes, their jobs, and ultimately their own families.The direction of ""The Pianist"", by the way, is exquisite: over the 148 minutes of projection, Polanski manages to perform a feat that is extremely difficult in productions of this type, making the spectator feel the slow passing of the years without, with that, the narrative becoming whether episodic or artificial. And more: by portraying Szpilman's journey, the filmmaker competently illustrates the difficulties he faces to stay alive, since food was a luxury item in times of war - so, whenever he arrives at a new hiding place, the protagonist is obliged to look for something to eat and drink, even if it means plunging your face in a bucket full of human waste.Meanwhile, Adrien Brody gives an absolutely unforgettable performance as Szpilman, embodying with incredible reality the physical and psychological decay of the character over the years: from his initial sophistication to his transformation into the animalistic figure seen at the end of the war. Passive to the extreme, the pianist is not a hero in the usual sense of the word, since his posture in the face of difficulties is never that of someone willing to fight for his ideals or even for his life: throughout the duration of the film, Szpilman is led from one end of Warsaw to the other by friends and allies, but he never questions the plans presented to him. Incidentally, the impression is that the subject keeps himself alive more by inertia than by persistence: when he is trapped for two weeks in an apartment without food, for example, he does not even try to find a way out of the problem, limiting himself to lie down on a couch and agonize until someone comes to help you.Present in virtually every scene of The Pianist, Brody carries the film with impressive strength - and, unlike the character played by Daniel Day-Lewis in Gangs of New York, who draws attention because he is an atypical figure, Wladyslaw Szpilman is an absolutely ordinary man, not having mannerisms or other characteristics that transform him into a unique personality, which certainly made the actor's work even more difficult. Szpilman's loneliness after being separated from his entire family is heartbreaking. He spends much of the film alone, wandering within the confines of the ghetto, fleeing destruction and slaughter and seeking an unlikely salvation. Adrien Brody's interpretation is superb, building a gentle, sensitive character who bravely resists all his misfortune. He relies on the help of friends to survive, but his greatest source of strength seems to be his music. This becomes clear again when he sits at the piano, unable to play it, and his fingers play the notes of Chopin's Grande Polonaise Brilliant in the air. Apart from the physical transformation, the beard, the dark circles under his eyes and the fourteen kilos he lost while preparing for the role, the actor conveys the character's feeling of loneliness with a simple look. It falls to him much of the task of proving to the viewer that the film is not just one of many on the subject.Another scene, possibly the most beautiful in the entire film, occurs when the musician is discovered in his hiding place by a German officer. Upon saying that he is a pianist, the Nazi asks him to play something on the old piano that the place houses. His interpretation of Chopin's tempestuous Ballad No. 1, a work with nuances ranging from melancholy to the densest anger, moves the officer and he decides to help him. Szpilman says everything that needs to be said through his music, and the wandering, almost spectral figure he has become is filled with an impressive vitality as he sits down at the piano to turn pain into music.Technically, the film does as well as it does in its content approach. The locations where the ghetto scenes were filmed were extraordinarily well chosen, including choosing regions of Warsaw that preserved the original wartime architecture. The photograph is dry, hard and makes no attempt, at any moment, to create colors that attenuate the sense of the indescribable catastrophe that is seen. Pawel Edelman's photography helps a lot to compose this scenario of calamity, as well as the total delivery of Brody, who goes through severely different physical phases in the period in which he is pursued, the way the film deals with his level of despair and others impresses men, an artist with the intention of shining is reduced to just a man who seeks to survive, who sneaks through small houses, hunting for crumbs and pieces of bread, crumbs and leftovers from past meals, who finds old loves now with other peers and who doesn't know if he will live another day or if he will find his own again. All this despair is easily translated to those who watch, and Wladek's destiny seems to be to suffer. The war actually only arrives in the final forty minutes, and he is invaded by despair, having the little refuge he had being bombed. The art direction (the work of Sebastian T. Krawinkel) is impressive, carefully recreating the Warsaw ghetto and also the ruins that the city was transformed into throughout the war - and the scene in which Szpilman sees the results of the bombings by the The first time is impressive, since the destruction of Warsaw ends up serving as a reflection of the character's own degradation.Visual effects are used in the right measure, without compromising the film or hiding a lack of ideas. Roman Polanski's direction full of intimacy is also very sober and does not bet on fuss or virtuosity, which would spoil the gravity and strength of his story. It is worth remembering that Polanski's parents were sent to concentration camps during the Holocaust and to deal with the story of Wladislaw Szpilman is to find yourself again with a painful part of your own history.Finally, in addition to the careful reconstruction of the story, the plot has a plot that grows as it unfolds, avoiding the most obvious solutions in order to shed light on the protagonist and the unfolding of events. Adjacent situations, which could serve more as a distraction than an advance, such as the German general who sympathizes with the pianist's drama, already at the end of the war, or even the artist's relationship with his music, end up being wisely circumvented in decisive passages. Thus, his message gains the strength it needs to emphasize its importance and pertinence, making it current and impossible to ignore. The Pianist is a class, of respect, art and life. To be seen, understood and reflected.Without worrying about creating melodramatic moments to draw tears from the audience, ""The Pianist"" is a sad film without, for that, needing to be emotional. The sadness provoked by this story does not come from moments artificially created through the use of the soundtrack or carefully written speeches, but rather from the frightening realization that human beings are capable of carrying out unimaginable atrocities - and the fact that the protagonist of this production is a pianist only adds to this fact, as it sets up a stark contrast between the creative beauty of the Arts and the insane monstrosity of War. On second thought, the protagonist of this film could perfectly well be a filmmaker. And, in a way, it is.",NA
"BluDiMado","19 October 2012","I believe this movie to be one of the most excellent movies of our times. It has several aspects that make it especially great. Firstly, the music, the most important feature of this movie, in my opinion. Chopin nocturnes and polonaises are perfectly chosen and arrayed to create an unforgettable atmosphere. In one scene, they even take time to play the whole piece of music, without interfering. Secondly, the actors in the movie: none of them are/were really well known, but WOW!

At the beginning, and from the title, I think this movie will give me such a nice experience of music composed in every scene. You know, I expect there are so much soundtrack from classic masterpiece and everything will be connected with music. The very first shot is some scene with piano-beat-rhythm. Suddenly, a great shot from tank try to break the whole building and hurt the main character of the movie. Just, what a great opening for such a reality-based-movie.The overcoming story just a very real experience from Wladyslaw Szpilman himself, and some from Roman Polanski, the director. Every detail of each screen is from an actual event, and the movie is not exaggerating the fact. Like action movie that will expose one or two climax scenes, but this movie consistent with the fact. Some people may think this movie little bit boring, but actually that is the beauty of a realist movie, a realist movie. It is not a beauty of comedy or action, just the history way.With a personal approach, this movie is nothing but a great deal of cinema experience. A war-view from an innocent and humble man, who try to survive in the era of crisis. The view, however, is like ""Grave of the Fireflies"", but the core of the movie is very different. There are sort of soul-power that will make Szpilman keep living, even in the starvation. And this kind of power make Szpilman keep playing his passion as a pianist.But, overall this is a superb movie, not complicated, and enjoyable. Above all, as I always said, it is very realist.",NA
"MF210","24 May 2003","I will say it The Pianist should have won Best Picture. But I am not putting down Chicago, I think both movies are great films. The Pianist is a holocaust movie, which is different from the 1993 masterpiece about the Holocaust, noneother than Schindlers List. The Pianist differs from Schindlers List because it spends all of its time in the Warsaw Ghetto, while Schindlers List spent time in the Ghetto and Labor Camps. We get a different point of view what it was like for the Jews. The Jews that stayed behind were forced to do some labor work for Nazis but their were Jews who were hiding in the Ghetto that fought back against them, though they didnt succeed. You dont see any fighting back in Schindlers List at all.
Adrien Brody delivers a great performance as a jewish pianist named Szpillman (not sure about spelling). Not Sure if its an award winning prformance but still a great performance. It maybe but I wanna watch the movie again. One thing I am sure about was that Roman Polanski (Director of the brilliant Chinatown) deserved his Oscar for Best Director, it was brilliant direction by a man who is close to 70 years old. The Pianist is a very well written movie but the screenplay is not award winning, I thought Adaptation should have won.This is my overall paragraph and I have alot of overalls to say. Overall, As much as i loved Chicago, The Pianist should have won for its powerful message and portrayal of what one man went through in the Ghetto during World War II. Overall, I prefer Schindlers List but The Pianist is a great film and will be remembered for years to come. Its a great achievement for Polanski. 10 out of 10.",NA
"sinam-02161","11 March 2023","This is one of the best War films ever made. Despite Roman Polanski's actions, this film's direction makes you feel like you are part of the world. Truely a piece of art. The movie may not be for everyone, expecially those who are very sensitive to violence and murder. But knowing that everything that happened in this film is true... That's just devistating. The messages to never give up and keep moving forward is amazing. The absolute pointlessness of what the Nazis did is so unsettling. They killed just for killing. The acting in this film is phenominal, from the body language to words spoken. Everyone involved did an amzing jobs with this film. Polanski's actions were wrong, but his directing and storytelling was undeniably great in The Pianist.",NA
"noralee","2 February 2003","My husband demurred going to see ""The Pianist ""as he ""didn't want to see another Holocaust movie."" Besides that every survivor's story is unique, besides the beautiful cinematography where color looks like browning black-and-white photos, and the tremendous performance and physical transformations by New Yorker Adrien Brody (and it's nice to finally see a real Jewish nose on a Holocaust movie star), Roman Polanski does have a different perspective to give. This is the first time I can recall a specifically Polish Jewish viewpoint, even though other films have also dealt with the Warsaw Ghetto's creation, uprising, and destruction. While Wladyslaw Szpilman's personal story is no way identical to Polanski's similarly accidental personal survival of the Holocaust, the film is suffused with what are clearly Polanski's vivid memories, particularly of pre-war Warsaw, the round-ups, and then the post-war city-wide devastation. The Szpilman family's urbane integration into secular Polish society is made clear at the outset; Wladyslaw is flirting with a non-Jewish colleague and the Nazi restrictions mostly interfere with his dating routine at first. Strong family ties, even among adult children, are beautifully portrayed.
But what is most startling throughout is the sympathetic view of Poles, unlike any similar movie. We hear frequently from Poles who are saddened by the restrictions, only see one glimpse of a Polish anti-Semite, and we frequently see Polish resistance fighters and their sympathizers, though they come out of the woodwork mostly due to Szpilman's fame. The infamous, compromised Jewish policemen in the Ghetto are given harsher treatment by the filmmaker. My ignorance of classical music made me miss a key point in one scene as I didn't know what piece he was playing and wanted to know if he was playing a Polish or German composer, though I inferred from the closing credits that it was probably German. But that was evidently a fictive scene. As I saw the film in Kew Gardens, Queens, settlement of many survivors, an elderly man on the line said, in a strong accent, when he was 15 in Warsaw after the war he'd met Szpilman, who recounted his story to him, and that the German who saved him did so for him as a human being, not a pianist.  Would that have been more moving?",NA
"Kirpianuscus","21 December 2015","a film about Shoah. but not like many others. because it is a story about survive with universal roots. a film about war. and about the way to be yourself in bitter times. a film about courage as result of vulnerability. and, more important, a film about music as refuge , gun and tool. Adrian Brody does a splendid role. the mark of Polanski gives to the original book new connotations. a film who presents not a page of history but an individual victory march. dark. and hopeful. dramatic. and cruel. but useful for define a world in which an ordinary young man has the force to not be puppet of events. few beautiful scenes. and the music. as precious lesson. about yourself.",NA
"drhoads-93743","4 January 2019","You can't do a Holocaust movie unless it's going to be great. If it's not great, then it's terrible. No in between.The Pianist is great. Challenges and triumphs. And not just your typical Holocuast film. It has something to offer. It's its own thing.Polanski doesn't just lazily try to pull at your heartstrings and hope you'll hand him an Oscar (which he couldn't accept in person). This is very much story-driven.It's not just tragic. There's more to it than that.If you haven't seen it, trust me. Watch it. And keep watching. It gets better and better.",NA
