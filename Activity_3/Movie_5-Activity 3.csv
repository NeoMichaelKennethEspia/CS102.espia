"FiendishDramaturgy","26 October 2003","What made this the hugely successful triumph it was? Was it casting, music, imagination, ingenuity, or luck?I remember opening day at the theaters. I was old enough to remember every scene, every character, every nuance of this film; having committed it to memory forever, as if I would never again be able to see this beloved, instantly loved masterpiece.I also remember that the HIT factor of this movie was so unexpected that you had to wait literal MONTHS to get the action figures promised on the cereal boxes. The pieces were still in the manufacturing process and we had to settle for coupons promising our toys in a few months. I wound up seeing this in the theaters a grand total of 36 times; much to my mother's dismay. She loved the movie as I did, but felt I was obsessed. Today, thirty years later, sitting here writing this review, I realize how right she was. I'm still obsessed with this movie, and with the subsequent movies which followed. I wait in great anticipation for Episode 3. I'm a fan, and I don't care what other people say about Episodes 1 & 2. I don't even mind the ""prequel"" factor, as the situation at the time, dictated to Lucas which movies he would do first.See, I remember the studios saying to him that he had to choose from the three central climactic books, and trash the rest, or just trash the whole idea. He didn't exactly ""sell out,"" he did what he had to do to get his movie...his vision...out there for us to see and experience. I admired his decision then, and I admire it now. Episodes 1-3 are being filmed now, because Lucas had the clout, the money, and the patience to give us his vision...his complete vision and not just the three center books of a 9-book series. I realize that now, there are dozens of books, but at the time, there were nine. And while most of us were happy with Episodes 4-6 and would not have missed 1-3 and 7-9, I personally am so very glad he has taken it upon himself to give us his full vision. I have enjoyed each and every installment with the same sense of awe and joy as I did this one.The casting was the first triumph for this cinematic milestone. Ford is a charismatic and magnetic personality and portrayed Han with a professionalism that you'd expect from more seasoned actors. Sir Alec Guiness is an absolute joy as Obi Wan. His casting was precise and excellent in that part. Carrie Fisher portrayed Leia in a way that, up until then, had never been experienced. Most ""princess"" types before her were whining, whimpering, little snots who were incapable of anything beyond tripping and twisting their ankle in times of peril, while Fisher portrayed her character as a bold, brazen, yet sophisticated and educated woman who was aware of her surroundings and capable of defending herself and her realm with the utmost authority.And Mark Hamil. He was perfectly cast as the whining little boy who wanted more, but was afraid to reach for it. He grows up quite well on film in these three installments, and endears himself to the audience so much the more for it. But a cast member who is almost always left out of these reviews is Peter Mayhew. Chewbacca. His character, as a supporting character to Han's, was exemplary. It's not easy portraying a walking carpet, yet holding the attention, admiration, and love of virtual millions. I am VERY happy about his being cast as Chewy in Episode 3. Couldn't happen to a more deserving...or capable...fellow. Bravo! And James Earl Jones's voice being used as the voice of Darth Vader, was pure genius. His commanding voice haunted the dreams of countless thousands of star-struck children for generations to come. I also have to say that this movie would not have had the charm it does had it not been for Anthony Daniels' C3P0. He is a gift and a joy.The musical score by John Williams featured in this masterpiece was one of the contributing factors. But honestly, this movie's success was such a total surprise to everyone, including Lucas, that nothing could prepare the world for the aftermath of having witnessed this bona fide legend, first hand.The story itself; replete with sub-plot after sub-plot, rich in dialog and detail, was beyond anyone's greatest expectations. Everyone, including Lucas, expected this movie to fail. It is a timeless classic, which I will not repeat here. There are too many movie reviews giving full details of the plot, and I won't be redundant beyond what I have already said.However, that being said, there are a few points I would like to make concerning the symbolism of this endeavor. The Force is a metaphor for the psychic abilities with which we are all born. It was also a metaphor for hope and faith, dedication and commitment to the greater state of being. The Empire is said to have been a metaphor for the Germanic Nazi ""storm troopers."" While the Rebellion is said to have been symbolic of (what would later become) the NATO forces who defeated them.And then there are the effects. The effects were, in 1977, so awesome; so creative; so ahead of their time, as to ensure this movie's vast success for the next forty years. George Lucas enjoys an almost god-like status among sci-fi/fantasy fans worldwide.This movie does not rate a rating. Usually, when I say that, it is because the movie is so bad, or disappointing that I don't have the heart to rate it. But in this case, it far surpasses any 10/10 rating I could give it.The Fiend :.","

"ivo-cobra8","23 April 2016","Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) is a classic phenomenal arguably the best sci-fi film in trilogy away, the one that started all and arguably changed the face of cinema forever. I love this film is actually my number 1 favorite film in the franchise and it is George Lucas masterpiece - the man who make this film happening. He wrote and Directed him self, I love this film to death! I love everything that is in A New Hope. Before I go in to this movie I want to say after watching the new awful horrible movie Episode VII The Force Awakens, I decide to re watch the original Star Wars Trilogy and I have always loved A New Hope and I always will. This was the first film in the trilogy that I have saw as a kid and that I remember. Star Wars are starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.The plot is actually more about Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia (Fisher), and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empire's space station, the Death Star. It is a mission returning the plans of Death Star to the Rebel Alliance, while Galactic Empire want's them back and it is lead by Darth Vader (David Prowse). This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and Special Effects.Star Wars is a film that I have watch it now and I will always watch it , because how much I really, really enjoy this film. This fun, pure joy, entertaining and truly a great film is like a classic, I recommend this film to any fan of the Star Wars trilogy, my favorite will always be A New Hope. This was the film that I have saw the first time as a kid and it grow on me. I love introduction when C-3PO and R2-D2 are walking trough the desert on planet Tatooine and are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew, Luke Skywalker. Here is the first time we met the character Luke Skywalker. This is the scene where C-3PO is walking trough the desert him self and than he saw someone far away and yells for help. I love this scene and it is the scene I remember from childhood.Which is your favorite character? My favorite character of all time is Luke Skywalker and I really love him so much. My second favorite character will be Han Solo but Luke Skywalker will be the ultimate hero of the galaxy for me.I love this flick, I love the end battle on Death Star, Luke joins the Rebel assault squadron and Luke becomes one of the few surviving pilots. Vader leads a squad of TIE fighters and prepares to attack Luke's X-wing fighter, but Han returns and fires on the Imperials, sending Vader spiraling away. Helped by guidance from Obi-Wan's spirit, Luke uses the Force and successfully destroys the Death Star seconds before it can fire on the Rebel base. I love that scene.I love John Williams score for Star wars which is the best score ever! It is an excellent score makes an actions scenes more exciting and more intense. George Lucas directed this movie well and did an excellent job been a writer as the same time been the director, the pacing is excellent the actors does an awesome job. I also love and I have enjoyed the character Darth Vader and I also love this film because it has a happy ending. Harrison Ford , Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher did all a great joy playing their characters.Carrie Fisher is really gorgeous in this film and for the 70's film it had great pacing and great imaginary story that dose not gives you only a snippet of the backstory. The fight scene between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi was excellent and the death scene of Obi-Wan was a honorable death. Alec Guinness did a perfect job as Obi-Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi he is excellent. Overall: I have said everything about this film that I love I forgot to mention I love Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker (I love to death), Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2. This flick get's a perfect 10 because it is the best beloved science fiction film.R.I.P. Carrie Fisher (1956 - 2016) she was the perfect Princess Leia and she is very missed.","

"mentalcritic","31 March 2003","I was actually born about a year after this film first premiered, but being a member of a family that was the first on the block to get such things as the VCR and the proper Hi-Fi system allowed me to catch this film in a number of different formats in the years ranging from 1982 to 1997. I think it is safe to say that without this film, I would have had no idea how truly evil a thing Pan And Scan is, or why multi-channel audio is such a damned important thing to have in the home theatre environment.Of course, I also knew that the film wasn't perfect. I could see a number of small problems where Lucas' budget just didn't quite go far enough, or where there just wasn't enough time to accomplish what was wanted. So when the announcement was made that in 1997, each film would be presented with improved special effects and footage that could not be integrated in the original cut for reasons of budget or practicality, I was excited.For the most part, I was overjoyed to see the new footage or effects. Mos Eisley now looks like a real city or port of commerce, without the viewer's sense of disbelief at the seemingly deserted streets needing to be suspended. The flight of the X-Wings towards the Death Star in its original form was very good, a marvel of its time, but when George finally got to show it the way he wanted to, it was almost the equivalent of watching the helicopters of Apocalypse Now decimating the village to the tune of Ride Of The Valkyries. The wonderfully composed tracking shots especially made the battle look almost as if it really happened and Lucas was just there to take pictures. And Jabba? Well, he doesn't look all that real, granted, but it was just nice to have that one piece of footage in order to make the appearance of Boba Fett in Episode V and the entire prologue of Episode VI make a bit more sense, especially to dullards.Unfortunately, there are a number of times when Lucas just goes too far in his quest to improve his work. Sometimes you can only do so much to anything before it starts to look overdone. Of course, I am talking about the scene between Han and Greedo in the cantina. In the original version, we are led to believe Han is a scoundrel who only cares about himself, giving us one of the best character arcs in the whole trilogy. It is also a great tribute to Sergio Leone, a nice reference to when Tuco shoots a potential assassin from his bathtub and tells the corpse ""When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk!"". Modifying this scene so it looks like Greedo shot first is an insult on a few levels. It insults Greedo as a character, making him look like one of the most incompetent bounty hunters in the galaxy. It insults the audience, who even at the age of six should no that you'd have to be blind, drunk, brain-damaged, or all three, to miss from that distance. Lastly, it insults the character of Han Solo by destroying a vital piece of said character arc. Watching Han go from scum to a leader of men, a space-age version of King Aragorn even, was one of the best things about the original Star Wars trilogy.The story itself is the stuff of classics in that it shows the most unlikely of heroes doing things that everyone else claims to be impossible. What Lucas got right in terms of pacing and plot here is exactly where he went wrong in the prequels, in that he makes the jump from location to location seem important to the plot and totally natural, rather than forced and choppy. The story and sense of adventure makes one forget that there are really only three major locations other than the inside of a space ship.Overall, the original Star Wars rates an eight out of ten. If Lucas had applied some common sense in conjunction with his rampant desire for revisionism, I would give it a ten, but as one critic who is famous for his negativity once said about Episode II, when was the last time anyone told George Lucas no? Still, this is a classic that should be shown to future generations as an example of how an imagination and enough literacy to realise it will open doors for you when nothing else will.","

"Sleepin_Dragon","18 September 2023","The Empire look set to continue their relentless war effort, new technology means they are pretty much unopposed, but a small band including Like Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo, look to fight back.I'm not sure what I can add that hasn't already been said, instead I'll try and imagine what it must have been like for someone, someone young perhaps, heading to the cinema in 1977, seeing this film for the first time.Consider what had gone before, people had Star Trek, and various other shows, but this film must have left audiences speechless, as there was quite literally nothing else like it.This film changed not just sci fi, but film making in general, the sheer scale and imaginative of it shame many of today's mediocre offerings.You have to admire the sheer bravery and audacity to get this film made, you wonder what doubts George Lucas had, he must have been elated when audiences turned round and fell in love with it.It's funny, entertaining, exciting, jaw dropping, moving, it's everything you want from a movie, years on, it's still a masterpiece.10/10.","

"UniqueParticle","16 January 2020","Only seen the original Star Wars films a few times, I tend to forget how great of a magical experience it is! A New Hope is so awesome in so many aspects especially the music and sounds of everything! It's amazing how it was made for it's time I still I don't understand how they did many things. I will admit it has a few bits that are boring but still glorious. Up until a few years ago I didn't see most of the films and I didn't understand the hype now I do in which I'm happy with them all even seen the new ones.","

"Bogmeister","25 December 2005","Though now known as ""Episode IV-A New Hope,"" for many of us, namely those of us who first saw this exhilarating entertainment in theaters back in '77, this will always be the first ""Star Wars."" We will always think of it as just ""Star Wars"" - plain & simple, no pretensions, no aspirations to deep film-making or high art. This is where we first met them all: Luke, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi (old 'Ben'), Chewbacca, the 2 robots C3PO & R2D2 and, of course, Darth Vader. They were instant pop culture icons; you got the sense you'd seen them before somewhere, but were sure this wasn't possible. But they'd been there before in our minds. We'd read about them constantly in science fiction novels and short stories - tales of outer space civilizations, of spaceships zooming through asteroid belts, of exotic-looking aliens hanging around space ports. We'd dream about them at night and try to imagine ourselves in their midst; up until then, we could only imagine such things - there were no projected images to realize such dreams. ""Forbidden Planet"" from 1956 came close, and then there were the ""Star Trek"" and ""Lost in Space"" TV series, both hampered by dime store budgets and cheesy sets. We ate 'em up since there was nothing else. Then Lucas made it real.I remember when I first got wind of the upcoming movie, to open in May of 1977, I think. I saw the first publicized poster and bought the novel adaptation. On the poster, a young man stood with some light sword raised, a princess at his feet, numerous spaceships flying all over the place. I was in my mid-teens and felt the first pulse of building excitement as I realized all those fantastic tales I'd been reading the past few years were going to come alive on the big screen for me. It didn't disappoint. Luke Skywalker, who stood in for all the boys pretending to be on a galactic adventure, gets swept away from his mundane desert home smack dab into the middle of an honest-to-gosh galaxy-wide civil war! The strength of the narrative is / was amazing. There are no slow spots and you can't wait for the next scene during the entire experience; and, experience is the better description for it, rather than just 'movie.' You can't wait, for example, for the moment when Luke actually meets the princess; what will happen then? It's a textbook case of an exciting narrative and what I believe makes this superior to all the sequels (knowing that many feel ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is superior - I must disagree).The one character you really can't wait to see again is the ominous Vader, naturally. The instant he steps into view during the first few minutes of the story, you just know this is the ultimate villain. This is the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool, the supreme uber-evildoer of the entire galaxy. You just know it by his stance, by his attitude, and by the electric chill that runs through your frail form as he steps down the corridor, moving into the annals of film history with one fell swoop. You can't wait to see what he does next, what nefarious action will send someone or some planet to its doom. Sure, he seems under the control of Tarkin (Cushing) here and later, the Emperor, but you just know he's simply biding his time until he takes over the whole damn universe. There is no precedent for Vader, and nothing close to him after. He's at his best here where there's still much mystery attached to his dark frightful form, a minion of Satan and Nazi stormtroopers all rolled into one.This was also the movie-experience which catapulted Harrison Ford (Solo) into superstardom. He seems almost childish here, not really straining to create a character, and it's this flip charm that makes it work, against all odds. He really does appear to have stepped out of the pages of some juvenile space opera, laser guns blazing, all snide remarks and foolhardy bravado. But he also becomes the older brother figure to Luke, who cannot carry the story by himself. Hamill, whose movie career began & ended with Luke, epitomizes the center of destiny for a galaxy. Both humble and arrogant, he's perfect in the role. Fisher's main surprise is that she's not all sugar and sweet as one would expect of a princess. These three characters evolved in the next two films, but they were always at their best here, icons given life for a short period - but also forever in film. The same could be said for Alec Guinness as Kenobi, a first class act all the way. You almost believe this elderly warrior could topple an empire, given enough time. Unless he runs into Vader...","

"paul_haakonsen","31 December 2015","Having grown up with the ""Star Wars"" trilogy, then ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is a classic in every sense of the word. This is the epic story of good vs. evil and of light vs. dark. But it is also a story of heroism, bravery and adventure. I am an fan-boy, yes, but what is there not to love about ""Star Wars""?George Lucas really managed to piece together a timeless classic that stands its own even today. And even with effects from 1977 it was light years ahead of its time, no pun intended. And the effects stand their ground even by todays standards.There is something uniquely amazing about the atmosphere and feel of the ""Star Wars"" universe. And it doesn't require much to be swept away and carried along to a galaxy far, far away...The cast in ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" did a good and memorable job with their individual roles and characters. And with this movie George Lucas established some characters that instantly became well-known and well-loved.""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is a movie of high space adventure with vibrant characters, creatures and spaceships. It is an enjoyable movie for the entire family, space nerds or not.If you are not already familiar with the legendary ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" movie, then it is more than due time to get to it.","

"SantiagoDM1","27 July 2018","""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...""Pre review:Its writing started in January 1973, ""eight hours a day, five days a week"", George Lucas said by taking small notes, inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterization... After many drafts, he finally came to a satisfactory conclusion.Then, Lucas presented Star Wars to the United Artists, but they refused to budget the film, so he went to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it was rejected, as the film concept was ""too strange"".Suddenly, Alan Ladd Jr -head of 20th Century Fox- appeared, a man that trusted in Lucas' genius. And that's how Star Wars became a reality.The shooting of the movie was full of mishaps, problems with practical effects never done before, a bad first edit of the movie, but that didn't stop George from fulfilling his Space Opera. Due to those setbacks, Fox Studios began to put pressure on Lucas to finish the movie. Finally, the movie was done. On the eve of Star Wars release, 20th Century Fox, George Lucas and his cast and crew braced themselves for the worse. One way or another, May 25, 1977 would be a day they would never forget...Review:Star Wars is a modern tale of mythic adventure. It follows the journey and growth of the protagonist: Luke Skywalker. His journey of discovery is set amidst a larger struggle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance; both parties are embroiled in a civil war. The Empire is comprised of corrupted power within a small group of leaders. These sullied leaders abuse their power over the masses with impunity. It is oppression and repression of the masses. The Empire wants to destroy the hope of the rebellion to ensure the small group of leaders can keep their power...One of the most important features of the movie are the special effects. The use motion control was even superior to Stanley Kubrick's revolutionary masterpiece: ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" thanks to the creation of The Dykstraflex, the first digital motion control photography camera system developed for Star Wars on 1976. Along with an incredibly iconographic character and production design, the movie became stylistically unique.The story and the characters are original and relatable. R2-D2 and C-3PO: the astromech as the optimistic adventurer's desiring to move forward. In direct opposition C-3PO, the protocol droid filled with doubt and reservations. Luke Skywalker, the brave hero, often haunted by doubts and hopes about his future journey. Obi-Wan Kenobi, the wise master and moral guidance of our hero. Han Solo, the rebellious smuggler whose personality represents tenacity. Leia, the damsel ""in distress"", a fearsome princess and general. Finally, Darth Vader, the most iconic character in the franchise, the merciless tyrant in a black suit, representing evil and final conflict of the journey.The film score presents an emotional resonance trough a romantic 1930s Hollywood orchestral score that was commissioned for composer John Williams, who succeeded to create a haunting constellation of operatic leitmotifs.The visual composition is authentic, as Lucas wanted a nostalgic ""filtered look"" so he kept changing key lights for a ""flashing"" effect. He used a loose, ""nervous"" frame, as in newsreels. The dramatic center was displaced, deflecting the eye to background activity, which in later films would include poetically changing weather. This first film gradually turned darker, following a symbolic color scheme where organic brown and warm gold yielded to high-tech black, white, and steely gray."" This is authenticity is reflected in it's most iconic shot: the 'Binary Sunset' sequence, which establishes the narrative through-line of the story and the world it takes place in, the main value of the scene lies in how powerfully and economically it develops Luke's character: As the suns begin to slowly sink in the evening sky, he gazes towards the horizon, his sense of longing for something more is palpable. Taking things further, he goes on to squint into the distance as if he could see his new future just out of reach, and for the first time we get to see him not as a kid, but for as a new hope.Books such as ""The hero with a thousand faces"" by Joseph Campbell structured the story, The War of Vietnam inspired the battle between the Rebels and the Empire, the lifestyle of buddhist monks characterized the Jedi, real shots of warplanes made the space battles real, Kendo foreshadowed the epic lightsaber duel, Akira Kurosawa's storytelling influenced the focus on minor characters, Fritz Lang's it's iconic protocol droid and John Ford westerns determined it's soul.The fascination with filmmaking and anthropology are the components that allowed Star Wars to be compelling and human, besides being located on a galaxy far, far away.10/10","

"TheLittleSongbird","22 November 2009","I couldn't have asked for anything more. Star Wars: A New Hope had it all. If I had to sum it up in one word, superlative would be my answer. I saw the film for the first time three months ago and loved it, and since then I have watched all the Star Wars movies. I was disappointed with the prequels (Attack of the Clones was my least favourite), but this, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back were perfection.I have to say that the film looks absolutely amazing even after thirty plus years, with highly imaginative sets and dazzling special effects. And the action sequences were superbly choreographed and brisk, the Death Star climax was a knockout. The music by John Williams is absolutely outstanding, by far one of his more exciting and rousing scores. The story is fast-paced, intelligent and has an essence of sophistication, and the screenplay is sharp and decisive.And the performances were flawless. In the prequels I had problems relating to some of the performers, namely Hayden Christensen as Anakin. Here, all the actors played their parts with superlative skill. Alec Guiness, one fine actor and will be sorely missed was a standout, likewise with Peter Cushing and Harrison Ford(hilarious here). Carrie Fisher was a fine Princess Leia, spunky, beautiful and sexy, and Mark Hamill was a completely likable Luke. And the villain Darth Vader, without doubt one of the best and in-depth villains in cinematic history, and James Earl Jones's deep booming voice was perfect for the character.All in all, a definite sci-fi classic, that blew me away. 10/10 Bethany Cox","

"budmassey","25 April 2005","Here begins the greatest cinematic epic of all time, and arguably one of the greatest stories ever told. Originally conceived as a serialized popcorn movie in the manner of the old action movies that Lucas grew up with, Star Wars surpassed even George's keen and bombastic imagination to become a central part of movie history.There are countless tales of the making of this movie; how Lucas never believed he would get the chance to complete the series, how it spawned an industry and made the name of nearly everyone who touched it a household word. But what that does not reveal, nor do the much diminished prequels, is the sheer joy and excitement these movies generated.It was a once in a lifetime experience. You could feel it from opening day, earlier if you paid attention to such things. We had never seen anything like it, and we are not likely to again.This episode finds young Luke Skywalker yearning to leave the agrarian life he has with his aunt and uncle, and chase after adventure as his friends before him have already done. And what adventure there is. The galaxy is in the grip of a massive rebellion against a tyrannical and oppressive empire, but on Luke's home planet, it's something you only dare speak of in a whisper.Along come two robots, ""Droids"" for short, who inadvertently involve Luke in a stellar attempt to contact an old wizard named Ben Kenobi, who lives in the caves near Luke's home.The rest is history, and there isn't a person alive in the civilized world who doesn't have at least some awareness of the epic story that unfolds. Luke's rise from adolescent obscurity on Tatooine to a leading role in the greatest struggle of all time is told with humor, action, adventure, and always a sense of story that is unmatched on the screen or on the page.With the completion of the prequel trilogy, these films are enjoying a renewed popularity among a generation that never saw the films on the big screen, and the theatric revivals are almost guaranteed. Go. Get some popcorn. And may the Force be with you.","

"Sfpsycho415","22 October 2003","I can never pick a favorite movie because different movies have different effects. Goodfellas is my favorite drama. Face/Off is my favorite actioner. But when it comes to pure amazement, nothing beats Star Wars. We are introduced to a whole other universe with different creatures, different lifestyles, and different history. We are dropped in the middle of an intergalactic war between an empire and a rebellion that has raged for years and left the universe in ruin. It was the most fascinating thing to see when i was eleven, but to this day i am still a Star Wars nerd.The cast of characters includes some of the coolest, funniest, and most tragic in film, and the actors who play them fit seamlessly into this new universe. Alec Guiness is flawless as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi on the run from the evil Empire. Harrison Ford is awesome as Han Solo, a smuggler and thief who helps the gang rescue the princess. But the my favorite character of all time is Darth Vader. Not only is he the coolest bad guy, but we learn in later films why he is evil and start to feel sympathetic for him. Not to mention that badass booming voice that can make ordering a pizza sound threatening.This was not only the beginning of the best movie series ever, but it was the beginning of my love for movies. George Lucas is a genius for being able to come up with a great story and an incredible backdrop for what was supposed to be a flop, but turned into one of the best films ever. 10/10","

"bkoganbing","20 September 2010","The awesome special effects and the creation of creatures that are part of the vivid imagination of George Lucas are not the reason for the enduring popularity of Star Wars and the franchise it spawned. Rather it is because of the characters Lucas created that will live as long as we have cinema and the means to display it.The spectacle is behind some real, but simple people. No shadings of gray in the first Star Wars we know without any doubt who the heroes and villains are of this piece. On an isolated planet a galaxy wide dictatorship called the Empire and the revolt against come to wear young Luke Skywalker as played by Mark Hamill and his family reside. So does Alec Guinness, a reclusive and mysterious hermit. An escape pod crashes there with two androids, C3PO and R2D2 and in the latter is a message for Guinness who was at one time a Jedi Knight, fiercest of a warrior class, from Carrie Fisher playing Princess Leia. Also in R2D2 are the schematics for the Empire's ultimate weapon the satellite size death star that can deal killing out on a planetary scale. This starts an adventure with young Hamill who teams up with futuristic soldier of fortune Harrison Ford as Han Solo and his simian like sidekick Chewbacca to rescue the Princess and defeat the Death Star.Those are the good guys. The bad guys are the blackest of black villainy. Peter Cushing cold bloodedly commands the Death Star, but the mysterious Darth Vader, clad in black with a helmet completely covering his head, has mysterious powers and even his superiors are wary of him. The voice of James Earl Jones is unforgettable as the black prince of the galaxy.These are characters that bring out the kid in all of us. The ones who claim the most sophistication in their lives will cheer on for Hamill and Ford and will be fascinated by the double dyed villainy of Darth Vader.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Star Wars and I speak now of all the films is the way such non-humans as the robots and Chewbacca the Wookie became characters. C3PO had dialog, but R2D2 had a few clicks and bleeks and all Chewbacca did was grunt, still they became as identifiable as the human characters.Star Wars set the standard for science fiction films to come for the next several generations. It was given six Oscars in a bunch of technical categories and it's got a re-release value that Gone With The Wind used to have.The Force Will Be With Us Always.","

"Tweekums","6 October 2008","When I first watched this in the cinema I was ten, it was 1977 and I'd never seen anything like it. It had me gripped from the start when a small spacecraft flew past being fired upon by another much larger one that was so big that it seemed to take ages to pass over the viewer. Unlike the recent prequels scenes such as this weren't cluttered with excessive CGI activity but instead showed what was needed in a way that hadn't been seen before. The special effects used throughout the film were ground-breaking for the time and still look great to this day, there is something more real looking about the models used when compared to today's CGI.The main character are all interesting and likable and the acting was all pretty good both from veteran actors like Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing who brought a suitable gravitas to the film and from younger actors Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher who brought a sense of youthful energy.In the unlikely event that somebody doesn't know what the film is about I'll give a brief synopsis; Set in a distant galaxy the forces of the evil galactic empire are hunting down the rebels who are attempting to restore the old republic. They are about to capture a rebel ship which has the stolen plans to the empires latest weapon, the Death Star, when they are hidden in a small robot (droid) by the name of R2-D2 by Princess Leah, he escapes in one of the ships escape pods along with his companion C3PO. They escape to the desert world of Tatooine where they are swiftly captured by strange creatures called Jawas who sell the pair to a farmer who gets his nephew Luke to clean them. While doing so he stumbles across a holographic message addressed to one Obi-Wan Kenobi. While Luke is off having his dinner R2-D2 escapes seeking Obi Wan.The next day Luke sets off to find him but shortly after doing so he is ambushed by Sand People who start ransacking his vehicle till they are disturbed by a robed figure who turns out to be Obi-Wan. He explains to Luke that he was once a Jedi knight and friend of his late father who had been killed by another Jedi called Darth Vader who had turned to the dark side of the force, they also see the full message that R2 is carrying which requests that Obi-Wan takes R2 to the planet Alderaan to get the plans to the rebels. While this is happening Vader who is on the ship searching for the plans dispatches troops to search for the two missing droids. By the time Luke returns home it is too late, the place is a burn out ruin and his aunt and uncle are dead. He decides that he will join Obi-Wan on his mission to Alderaan.They hire a ship, called the Millennium Falcon, from a smuggler called Han Solo who needs the money to pay off a debt and avoid the various bounty hunter who are after him. When they arrive at Alderaan they find it is no longer there, it has in fact been destroyed by the Death Star in an attempt to get Princess Leah to tell them where the rebels are based. Soon after arriving the Millennium Falcon is captured after it goes to investigate a small moon that turns out to be the Death Star. While Obi-Wan is off trying to disable the tractor beam that captured them Han and Luke discover that Princess Leah is being held in the detention area and set off to rescue her... I won't say any more as I don't want to spoil the ending.I think this is a film every body should see at least once, it might not be perfect but if it wasn't for this recent cinematic history would be quite different; it kick-started a revival in science fiction that lead to things like Battlestar Galactica, the return of Star Trek and Alien and was possibly the first ""block-buster"" film. In many ways it was more than just a film it was an event; everybody at my school was talking about it and little else, till one watched it you were completely out of the loop. The characters and there adventures in this and the other films in the franchise have become part of modern folklore.These comments were made based on the video released in the '80s... so no extra CGI and Greedo didn't even attempt to fire before Han killed him.","

"MaxBorg89","15 November 2005","This great classic has so many good elements it's almost impossible to list them all: The breathtaking visual effects, still awesome 28 years on; the brilliant script, which mixed epic battles and duels with matinée-serial-style characters and dialogues; the debut of one of the greatest villains in cinema history, Darth Vader; John Williams'amazing and unforgettable score, among the Top 10 best scores ever...All those things are just some of the reasons Star Wars is among the best movies (not just sci-fi) ever made: viewing after viewing, it never stops being impressive, and words are nearly useless to describe the impact it still has on the audience.George Lucas basically took a medieval story and moved it to a distant galaxy, on weird and fascinating planets. Almost everything is taken from the Middle Ages: there are knights, sword-fighting, evil Empires, unsatisfied people who want to overthrow the system, beautiful princesses waiting to be rescued...Then we've also got speeders, light-sabers, peculiar (and, in the case of Jabba the Hutt, disgusting) creatures, the Death Star, and of course the Force, that fascinating energy which is supposed to bring balance to the galaxy.The cast is a gas, both the newcomers and the veterans: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford are great as Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo (Ford in particular is hilarious as the arrogant but ultimately nice ""scoundrel""), but the most memorable performance is of course Alec Guinness'portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi, the old, wise Jedi who returns one last time to initiate Luke to the mysteries of the Force.But let's not forget what everybody immediately thinks of when Star Wars is mentioned: Darth Vader. Feared by his opponents as well as his servants, this completely emotionless foe has become the very symbol of Lucas'masterpiece. He's one of those movie-characters people will remember as long as films will keep being made and his unsettling breathing noise still echoes in our memories...The beginning of a wonderful saga, whose only rival is The Lord of the Rings.May the Force be with you...","

"SnoopyStyle","29 September 2013","This story happened 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away'. The galaxy is under the dictatorship of the emperor. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is part of the rebellion but is capture by the evil Darth Vader. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the young hero, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) the brigand, his sidekick Chewbacca, and the wise master Jedi Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) must together rescue the princess and save the galaxy.The characters are icons pulled from classic storytelling like Akira Kurosawa's ""The Hidden Fortress"". George Lucas was able to assemble such iconic characters into a well told story. Rarely is a movie change the nature of movie-making, and even the wider culture. This may be on the list of the most important movie ever. It changed the tone of movies from the gritty morally-confused 70s to the popcorn selling blockbusters that are soon to come.","

"owenmul","27 March 2015","Star Wars is simply a fantastic film, on every level this film is amazing.Each of the characters in this film are so well developed and so interesting that you just cannot wait for the next scene with them in it, the interactions between the characters us at times tense and at times downright hilarious, leaving no room for boring or lacking dialogue. The particular stand outs in this respect I feel are: Han Solo, the wise cracking bounty hunter with a tendency for arrogance that makes every scene as entertaining as possible. Secondly there is Darth Vader, who is the optometry of cool, scathing evil who poses as the ultimate villain.Surprising to me, the cinematography and special effects have held up all this time. Although there are some minor issues, one particularly notable one is during the scene where Luke is training with the training droid aboard the Millennium Falcon there are a few frame skips where Luke extends and contracts his lightsaber. Other than this though, the cinematography and special effects are amazing to have held up, particularly the shots of the Empire's space fleet moving through space which are absolutely stunning.One of the things that absolutely makes this film for me is the magnificent score, composed by John Williams. This score, while being one of the most iconic scores of all time, manages to make every single scene, fitting the mood of the scene perfectly.The story as well is fantastic, there is never a dull moment; every second of it an absolute thrill ride. Whether its the attack on the Death Star or the Cantina of Mos Eisley the story takes you through the twists and turns of this classic space opera.If I could recommend one sci-fi adventure film to someone, it would be this, it's an absolute must see.More Reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/","

"ShadeGrenade","9 May 2008","This is not a review of the first ( and best ) 'Star Wars' movie. I take it, fellow I.M.D.B. users, that you are already familiar with the plot, characters and production history, and how its success changed the face of cinema overnight. So rather than rehash all the known facts, I want instead to recount a personal memory.I first learnt of 'Star Wars' thanks to Granada's 'The Krypton Factor', a long-running game show designed to test contestants' intelligence, physical fitness, powers of observation and so on. I liked the latter round as it often gave one a chance to catch a sneak preview of a new movie. One week, they ran a clip of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, R2D2 and C2PO escaping The Death Star in The Millennium Falcon, and being shot at by pursuing T.I.E. fighters. I fell off my chair. What was this? 1970's sci-fi movies were mostly depressing affairs, predicting gloomy futures for Mankind, now here was something fast, colourful, and lively, with lasers zapping about outer space and explosions. Right up my street.I had to see it. But the film was not yet on release here. There was no Internet then so I got my movie information from the local paper. I kept checking for news of an impending screening at my local cinema, but no - there was nothing. I began to wonder if the movie actually existed or not. Had Granada pulled off the greatest hoax of all time? I read the Sphere book voraciously until I knew the story backwards. I played the Meco disco single at every opportunity. When Marvel's comic adaptation went on sale, I was almost thrown out of the newsagent for jumping up and down for sheer joy.At my school, 'Star Wars' was a dirty word to sci-fi fans, mainly because it was not 'Close Encounters'. The Spielberg picture was regarded as 'adult' and 'intelligent', while the Lucas movie was deemed 'kiddie stuff' starring weirdos in fancy dress running around with a bloke dressed as a big teddy bear.The wait dragged on and on. In an episode of 'Coronation Street', Gail ( Helen Worth ) asked her then-boyfriend, Steve Fisher: ""When's 'Star Wars' coming round here?"" to which he replied: ""It'll be some time I expect."". His words encapsulated the sheer frustration and impatience felt by all us U.K. fans. The highest grossing film of all time and we can't see it? What is the hold up? Are they redoing bits for the benefit of British audiences? Peter Cushing and Alec Guinness are in it so this cannot be right.In desperation, I told a blatant lie to my best friend. ""I have seen 'Star Wars'"", I proclaimed. He looked about as shocked as if I'd said I'd spent the night with Carrie Fisher. I claimed that my uncle Eric worked for Twentieth Century-Fox ( another lie. He drove taxi cabs for a living ) as an assistant editor and George Lucas had been so impressed with his work on the film, he had generously given him a print. To back up my claim, I reeled off a long list of plot details and scene descriptions. I got a few things wrong, such as Jabba The Hut and Biggs Darklighter, both of whom were excised from the final cut. But by the time my friend saw the film he had forgotten these. He did beg me to ask my uncle to run the film specially for him on Sunday afternoon, but I deflected this by stating that Uncle Eric's projector had broken down. He never asked again.Being about fifteen, I was too old for the toys, hence on Christmas Day 1977 I was denied the pleasure of reenacting the assault on The Death Star in my garden shed, with the aid of elastic bands, old Subbuteo figures and the John Williams soundtrack thumping out of my Hitachi tape recorder.After what felt like an eternity, the movie finally opened here and suddenly it became fashionable to denounce it as 'overrated'. 'It was childish when they were playing trumpets in the Cantina' was my best friend's verdict. That was all he had to say on the subject ( he would have made a great film critic! ). Many people felt that the film had not been worth the six month wait. I was one of the few to speak in its defence. I was glad that sci-fi movies were fun again. Nobody left the theatre with a spring in their step after seeing Milo The Baby Chimp's parents brutally murdered by the U.S. Government at the end of 'Escape From The Planet Of The Apes'.'Star Wars' spawned two sequels, neither as good, and inspired the likes of 'Alien', 'The Black Hole', 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' and countless others. Without Lucas, these would simply not have been made.I am not a big fan of the prequels, but then I'm not young anymore, so can't enjoy that kind of movie in the same way. 'Star Wars' brought 'A New Hope' to those of us wanting old fashioned escapism on the Silver Screen again. I envy kids today for not having to wait until winter for the latest summer blockbuster.","

"Prichards12345","22 May 2006","I first saw this film on a warm March Sunday evening in 1978, after queueing for a whole hour to get into the cinema. Oh, the anticipation! The excitement! The magic! And here was a film that changed the whole concept of cinema forever, for no matter how many times I return to it, in the flickering dark of the cinema, or the wondrous, glittering DVD release, or in where the film really scores - at the centre of my imagination, that night will live forever in my memory. ANYTHING was possible, wonders could be achieved. Miracles in the here and now. And how lucky I was to share in it.To the squares that loathe it - I pity you daddyos; you'll never experience what millions of us have felt these past three decades. Go and see Henry Jaglom again; I'll stick with Mr. Lucas - he is THE MAN!I love this film. Forget what flaws it has - minor they are indeed. Star Wars has become a mystic myth and that sorcerer supreme, Jedi master George Lucas, has given me more pleasure than I can measure. My favourite bit? Almost impossible to choose. Okay, if I must...the stunning Tie Fighter battle with the Millennium Falcon, a work or art in the editing room. It should be hung on a wall somewhere.George, old chap, if you're ever passing my house please knock - and I'll make you a cup of tea. You deserve that much at least!","

"Marx_Bros_Fan86","21 February 2007","Star Wars seems to lack the sense of importance that all of the sequels and prequels had. This one just seeks to entertain, and there's nothing wrong with that! Star Wars is one of those miracle movies (a term borrowed from Leonard Maltin) where everything went wrong but it all came together in the end, like Jaws and The Wizard of Oz. The movie was plagued by budget problems, and Lucas was so behind schedule he suffered a few panic attacks, which is probably why he did not direct the sequels. Star Wars takes the audience on a series of adventures, from encountering sand people in the desert to rescuing a princess on a space station. The special effects and production design is amazing. It takes you into a whole new galaxy and makes you believe it's real. I liked how everything looked old and dirty; prior to Star Wars everything in Sci-fi movies looked brand new. John William's Star Wars score adds a whole new element of fun and is arguably the best work of his career. I can't imagine what Star Wars would be like without his music.The main characters are all familiar archetypes. Luke is the restless, immature boy who wants to get off the farm and have an adventure. Han Solo is the rugged pirate who only cares for himself. Harrison Ford really steals every scene he's in with his wise guy attitude. Obi-Wan Kenobi is the Sorcerer/Mentor stereotype, like Merlin. Alec Guinness brings a certain classiness to the role, even though this is not even close to his best performance. His final lightsaber battle is slow and boring due to the limitations of the weak lightsabers (David Prowse kept breaking them!) and his old age, but he delivers his verbal quips quite nicely, as does James Earl Jones. The scene where he dies is still very powerful; I love how Vader steps on his empty robe, it's like he's thinking ""hey, where are you hiding?"" Carrie Fisher plays the kidnapped princess; her performance is tougher and feistier in this movie. She loses those qualities to a certain extent in the following movies.Hammer Horror film veteran Peter Cushing played the sinister Imperial Officer, Grand Moff Tarkin. It's amazing how Cushing was able to slip into the role of the villain so easily (he certainly looks evil), considering the fact he was most famous for playing protagonists like Van Helsing and Dr. Frankenstein. I cannot give enough praise to James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader, one of the greatest villains of all time. Some of the dialog is embarrassing but the cast was able to bring the characters alive. That is the most important difference between the originals and the prequels. These characters were not complex in any way, but they had good chemistry with each other. The prequel's characters felt like cardboard. I used to think this was the most boring Star Wars film, and I just don't understand why anymore. I've noticed this film gets criticized for bad pacing, and I could not disagree more. Star Wars has the best pacing of the original trilogy. Empire's plot stopped moving in the middle of the movie, and the first 35-40 minutes of Jedi were a total pit stop. Star Wars on the other hand smoothly builds up to the final climax at the Death Star, without any long story lags. The Battle of Yavin has been criticized for being too long (by Alec Guinness and Roger Ebert), but I don't mind. The Death Star's destruction is an exhilarating moment. Star Wars is also the funniest movie in the series. The bickering between the three heroes on the Death Star is hilarious.In 2004 the Star Wars movies were revised yet again for the DVD release. I have to say I'm disappointed with how the original trilogy has been treated by Lucas. He seems to support film preservation in every case, except when it comes to his own movies. To me, replacing actors and revising special effects is just as bad as colorizing a black and white movie. It eliminates all of the historical significance. I hope one day the original trilogy will receive better treatment in the future. I would recommend buying the original trilogy on DVD now while you still can. It might not be released again, but with Lucas you can never tell.","

"hitchcockthelegend","29 March 2009","Princess Leia is captured and held hostage by the Imperial Army as it seeks to rule the Galactic Empire. An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi may just be hers, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it.Back in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day.As the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not, because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here), it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach, and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox's historic blockbuster didn't run with the baton, in fact most pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment.It is by definition one of the most successful films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn't know it at the time, but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn't just make a movie, he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas' baby. Ultimately, though, it's one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it's that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it's an event that is like hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10","

"Horst_In_Translation","2 November 2015","""Star Wars"" is a 2-hour science fiction movie from almost 30 years ago written and directed by George Lucas. There really needs nothing to be said about how good this is for a 1970s movie, especially in terms of technical aspects. The Academy certainly got it right by giving them all these Oscars for it. However, it lacks in certain other areas unfortunately. First of all, the acting isn't too great. That is not really a problem of the characters though, but rather of the way they were written, which simply offered no room for outstanding performances. And Peter Cushing's character was downright forgettable despite being the main antagonist. Instead people remember Darth Vader obviously. Why? Because this film is all about the way the characters look and not what they do or say. A bit style over substance. Apart from that, I am quite surprised Alec Guinness scored an Academy Award nomination for his turn here.The script is not the greatest achievement in general. It's the usual black-and-white characterization with good vs evil and the characters have no real shades, no facets. This was made up again by the strong work in other departments as it's not too memorable what they say and do, but what they look like, especially the non-human characters who are all somewhat considered legendary today. I am not saying the characters are written badly. Not at all. But it's just other contributions that made them what they are today. Not the script. And while I enjoyed most of the film, I cannot see it as an epic or a cult classic as so many people do to this date. ""Star Wars"" is bound to rise again with the new film coming out soon and featuring the original cast again. It should be interesting what they make out of it. Until then, feel free to watch the old films like this one, but not too many. The very first Star Wars film here is not a great achievement in terms of story, only in terms of all visual and audible aspects.","

Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Anthony Daniels and Carrie Fisher all give incredible performances. James Earl Jones is fantastic as Darth Vader, one of the best villains of all time. Alec Guinness gives a great supporting performance. The visual effects are stunning and still look really good. It's extremely well paced and genuinely thrilling throughout with excellent action sequences and space battles. The music by John Williams is perfect as well as George Lucas's direction as the film is beautifully filmed.","

"bob the moo","30 June 2002","The Republic has fallen and the Empire rules the galaxy as a dictatorship, seeking to destroy dissenting voices.  The Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, is fully on line and capable of destroying whole systems.  The Jedi have been destroyed, save a few living in hiding, unable to compete with the force of the Empire.  However Princess Leia has the plans showing a weakness within the Death Star.  Before she is captured by Darth Vader she gives them to droids C3PO and R2D2 and they escape.  When they land on a nearby planet they find Luke Skywalker and set out to find the owner of the droids Obi Wan Kenobi, or Old Ben Kenobi.  Obi Wan begins to train Luke in the way of the force as they try to get the information to the Rebellion before the Death Star can be used at full power.It's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking  lets be honest, Lucas isn't the Shakespeare of our generation.  However what it is, is a good story of good v's evil, a western of goodies v baddies set in space.  The story is simple but contains clear characters.  The thing that sets it apart is the fun  the sense of wonder for kids but also the enjoyment it brings to adult. The story is good for a sci-fi with a lot of history and back-story clearly set out up front.  The action scenes are mostly great  not dry effects but with a real sense of action and excitement too.This may be the 4th part but it's also our first chapter, it is light and enjoyable but hints that this is only part of an ongoing battle.  The way it relates to kids and adults is obvious as it broke records and everyone of a certain age knows about Star Wars!  The effects still look good today  in many ways the model work looks better than all digital effects simply because they are `real' and don't just exist within a computer.  Sound effects, comedy, music  it's all pitch perfect and sets up the rest of the series really well.Hamil is ok as Skywalker (`Blonde hair, blue eyes'  Chasing Amy!).  He is suitable for a kids film and he does well with his role.  However like part 1 has Anakin at his least interesting, part 4 has Luke yet to develop into darker areas.  Ford is perfect as Han Solo  he adds character and flair to some dry performances.  Alec Guinness adds maturity to the whole film and is so good is Obi Wan that even Ewan McGregor just does an impression rather than recreate the role.  Darth Vader is just the right side of silly camp villain, Jones' voice is a perfect fit and he has real menace and power. Bits players such as Chewie, C3PO, R2D2 etc all add comedy in spades.Overall this film is even better now that we know how it all fits together in Star Wars `history'.  But even without all the hype this is a really fun sci-fi that is enjoyable, simple and really good fun to watch if you're in the mood.  Having a deeper perspective on it just makes it all the better.","

"classicsoncall","6 June 2007","I couldn't let the thirtieth anniversary season of ""Star Wars"" slip by without a commemorative viewing today to remind me of the start of this hugely successful franchise. Though it's not one of my own personal Top Ten films of all time, I can understand how so many fans come to see it that way. At the time it was a seminal film that reinvigorated the sci-fi genre; my first viewing when it debuted in theaters garnered more than a single 'Whoa' with each new scene and concept that hadn't been done before. I was particularly intrigued with the names of the characters George Lucas created for his heroes, sounding uniquely original and matching their physical description and characters. Could Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, or Princess Leia have been called anything else? How about Jabba the Hutt; he looks exactly how a Jabba the Hutt would look if there was a Jabba the Hutt. Makes sense, doesn't it? I get a kick out of the nay sayers on this board who have such a fierce guttural reaction to the success of the entire Star Wars franchise, never missing an opportunity to thrash it unmercifully. The best response to that I guess would be that they represent a mere six and a half per cent minority of the IMDb voting history for this film that give it less than a 6.0 rating. It reminds me of that joke about the one in three people who might be crazy, and your two best friends seem alright. Something to think about.Anyway, there's no point in detailing the film since virtually every one on the planet has probably seen it at least once, even my wife. My son, who was born in 1977, has probably seen it thirty times a year every year since he started watching movies, kind of a record in itself I would think, allowing him to quote virtually every line of dialog from the movie. Such is the compelling nature of true Star Wars fans, who while watching, find themselves in a galaxy far, far away.","

"claudio_carvalho","13 December 2015","During the attack of the Empire's forces under the command of Darth Vader (David Prowse) to her spacecraft, the rebel Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) hides in the memory of R2-D2 the plans of the powerful Empire's Station Death Star that spies from the Rebel Alliance have stolen. She assigns the droid to deliver the plans to Obi-Wan Kenobi with a message to give the plans to the rebels. R2-D2 flees to the Planet Tatooine with his fellow C-3PO in a space pod and land on the desert, but they are captured by Jawa traders. They are sold to Owen Lars (Phil Brown) and when his nephew Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is cleaning the droid, he accidentally activates part of the message and he wonders whether it would be addressed to the old Ben Kenobi. On the next morning, Luke discovers that R2-D2 is seeking out Obi-Wan Kenobi and he goes after him with C-3PO. They are attacked by the Tusken Raiders and saved by a drifter, who is Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that tells part of his past as Jedi to Luke. He also tells that his father was a Jedi Knight and gives a light-saber that belonged to his father to Luke. Obi-Wan invites Luke to travel with him to Alderaan and when he finds that his family was killed by the Imperial soldiers, he decides to join Obi-Wan in his quest. They head to Mos Esley to hire a skilled pilot and they team-up with the smugglers Han-Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Meanwhile the evil Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) orders to destroy the planet Alderaan to show the power of the Death Star to Leia and the rebels. Obi-Wan feels the impact in the Force and when the Millennium Falcon arrives at the destination, the group finds only debris. Further, a tractor beam pulls the spacecraft to the Death Star. What will happen to the group and Princess Leia? Will they succeed in delivering the information to the rebels?""Star Wars"", later retitled ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is the unforgettable and charming sci-fi adventure that surprised the world in 1977. The strategy of George Lucas that claimed that there was no technology available to the cinema industry in 1977 to produce the three first chapters was part of a marketing strategy that kept alive the interest of fans fro the whole six chapters, In sequence, great part of the mystery would not have raised. All the films are engaging, but none of them can beat this one rated #19 in IMDb. Harrison Ford in the top of his career and the cast show a wonderful chemistry. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Star Wars: Episódio IV – Uma Nova Esperança"" (Blu-Ray) (""Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope"")","

"Kingslaay","20 February 2018","When Star Wars came out in 1977 there was nothing like it, it came out of nowhere and was so different. It is indeed a product of its time and would have fascinated many kids of the era. As a film it is very simple and easy to follow. There are no big twists, dilemmas and the good forces come on top. The special effects and film have definitely aged but it has some classic elements. Darth Vader, the army of storm troopers and the mighty light saber is unlikely to be forgotten. Star Wars as a franchise clearly benefited from coming out at the right time, this was the day before competitive television, streaming services or films like Inception. The immortality of Star Wars lies in its simplicity, linear story and vast imagination. This appealed to millions of kids who grew into adults who still loved identified their childhood with this series.","

"Med-Jasta","12 April 2020","Who would have thought that an experimental director would have had to resurrect classic hero story telling? Well, that's where they were in the 70s. And Lucas did it with such perfection. He did his research and he cared. And most importantly he was trusted to make the movie that he wanted.A New Hope is the greatest successes story in Hollywood not only because it changed movies and made a lot of money and continues to touch people to this day. But because nobody believed in Lucas. Alan Ladd Jr at Fox and Mark Hamill were about it. Not only that but this production had everything go wrong with it. It was literally against all odds from everyone including the studio. Then it was a smash hit of unheard of proportions.Once a teacher of mine asked if movies were more than movies. And he said, ""look at Star Wars, yes they are."" And he wasn't even a fan. This is more than a movie because it speaks to people in a way that can't be described. They've tried but no one can. It's something that you feel because Lucas updated the hero myth. He took what worked in stories from all around the world since the dawn of time and made it his own.And he's really good at making movies. I think really the biggest contribution to movies overall isn't the special effects and the return to good versus evil storytelling. It's that Lucas really cares about how quickly the movie flows. He doesn't keep things that hang and everything is always moving. Movies became much faster after this. Because Lucas really focused on the pace and feel.Out of all 6 movies this one can stand
alone, as it was intended, well not intended but it was equipped to be one movie. As a fan this was always the worse of the original 3 because the next two were better. But when I got older and saw the movie proceeding this I understood it. After the French Connection and Dirty Harry and The Godfather and so many others, which are all good but I finally saw why Lucas wanted to make this. And the movie clicked for me and I loved it much more. Fun, simple, fast and good vs evil.This movie really does everything right. Every time I watch it I'm excited and laugh at every joke. It's an uplifting movie that many have tried to duplicate and are either too much of this or that.We talk about the influences for this but that's not what makes it so good, it's Lucas. While themes and motifs are taken from other sources there really isn't anything that is directly from something else. He took those ideas and made them his own. He knew how far to go, where to stop. Because Lucas has always shown restraint.I wonder what people will think when they watch them in Episode order? Where's the Emperor? Where's Yoda? Who are all these new people? Why is Vader hardly in it?Anakin is now pathetic. He always was but we never realized it. Grand Moff Tarkin is his boss. Vader takes orders from him. He is just doing what the Emperor tells him to do. It's funny that he became such a pop culture icon of evil. That was never the intention. I love James Earl Jones voice in this one because it's much more angry and sinister that the other two.I love when Wedge blows up the Tie then flies through the flames. I'm glad Lucas changed this for the special edition because I was always confused as a kid there.The music... My God the music! John Williams is always great and all 6 are great but this one in particular is the best. Especially during the last fight. Just think of it with other music and it's totally different.3p0 and R2 bickering is so funny. And Alec Guinness really helps bring weight to the history in the movie. Something about his warm presence really adds a lot to the movie. He makes it so seem real.But I have to say my favorite scene and I don't know why. Maybe because you can boil Star Wars down to this one moment. Is when Luke and Leah swing across the chasm. The music, the guy holding the girl, the adventure, the romance... Something about it gets me every time.As a kid Star Wars was dead. I was born in 85 and that was the lowest year of Star Wars popularity. So this wasn't shoved in my face. My dad showed me the movies because they were PG. There were no adds, none of my friends were into it. But I loved it and was obsessed. No influence from any where. That shows you the effect it has on a kid. It did in 77 all the way till now and it will forever.Lucas made something that speaks to not only kids but the kid in all of us. I can't tell you how many times I site star wars to distinguish between right and wrong. And my lessons haven't stopped, they continue with age. Lucas is the Midi-chlorian that shows us the force/this side of ourselves. I really wonder where the world would be without Star Wars","

"ametaphysicalshark","4 November 2008","I was never a ""Star Wars"" guy growing up. I wouldn't say that I was a ""Star Trek"" guy growing up either (""Doctor Who"" was my sci-fi franchise of choice growing up, and still is, even though I'm not a big fan of Russell T. Davies' version of the show), but I would definitely choose my favorite episodes of the original series or ""Deep Space 9"", ""The Wrath of Khan"", and ""The Undiscovered Country"" over any ""Star Wars"" film. I've seen the original trilogy a couple of times previously, once as a kid, once in my mid-teens, and now I sit down to watch ""Star Wars"" again, having been inspired by catching half of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" on TV recently and being enthralled by it.The first thing that struck me is how great the opening shot is, just after the scrolling text that is. The rest of the movie was pretty much how I remembered it being- a collection of great set-pieces and memorable characters, and a great mythology, but with a story which wasn't nearly as grand and great as ""The Empire Strikes Back"". Although a point of criticism aimed at ""Star Wars"" by its (relatively few) detractors is that it doesn't quite match the real feel of a 30's/40's serial, I think that it really does, and not only in the way it is shot and the transitional wipes and all that, but in the writing, the acting, and just about everything else. It has that same sense of adventure, and although this particular film is nowhere near as good as some of my favorite serials, it remains something which very accurately captures the feel of watching one of those, and its popularity (and the popularity of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") is hence quite understandable, as very few of even the big summer blockbusters have the same sensibility and sense of adventure, and well, fun.Watching ""Star Wars"", in spite of it not being my favorite of the original trilogy, serves as a reminder of the talent which George Lucas had at one point. I don't think this film is as good as his previous effort, ""American Graffiti"", which is the greatest 'coming of age' film I've ever seen, and one of the most beautiful films ever made from a visual standpoint, but it's still got spirit and energy which his later efforts just don't. It's quite sad, really. There's really nothing I can say that hasn't been said already (which is true, certainly of many popular films, but this is freakin' ""Star Wars"", so trust me, I have NOTHING to add to what has already been said). There are ""Star Wars"" devotees who swear it is the greatest of the trilogy and one of the best movies ever made, there are detractors who think it's cheesy nonsense, and then there are others like me who like it quite a bit, but aren't sure where all the extravagant praise comes from. ""The Empire Strikes Back""... Well, that's a whole other story.8/10","

"saveliydalmatov","30 December 2023","The beginning of one of the most legendary franchises with one of the most elaborate worlds in the history of cinema.There is no denying, even if you are not a fan of this franchise, the contribution to cinema that this film has made.A charming and memorable soundtrack combined with strong and soulful scenes gives a wow effect.It is this movie that includes a huge number of events that capture you and immerse you in history. The powerful and dramatic first half, contrasting with the cheerful and humorous second, gives a very complete and versatile film.Characters - there's nothing to say here. Darth Vader - who can compete with him in popularity among villains except the Joker? The ""kind"" characters of the film - Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Han Solo and others - are known to almost everyone. And for good reason!Yes, the graphics here are still a bit weak, but after such thoughts, look at the release date - 1977, and then remember the atmosphere and elaboration of this picture and think about whether you gave the right claims to this story?And the same ""old"" special effects are still very cool for those years and the eyes are not too sore.The only thing is that because of the possibilities of that time, Darth Vader does not look as cool as in new films and animations, and fights on light swords not best. But, unfortunately, these were the conditions before.George Lucas came up with an interesting idea - to start the franchise with the 4th film. But there were conditions for that - filming the first three episodes was impossible at that time.In general, this is the beginning of a great saga that is worth watching, it is not for nothing that it is considered a classic and revered by more than one generation.My rating is 9/10. Great!","

"BA_Harrison","25 February 2007","There was no way my review of this classic slab of pulp sci-fi was ever going to be anything but glowing; as a nine year old I saw George Lucas' space opera on its original release and instantly became one of a legion of fans who spent the next twenty years worshipping at the altar of the great turkey-necked director (until The Phantom Menace shattered all of my illusions).Thirty years on, and I'm revisiting Star Wars with my two children, hoping that they will fall in love with it as much as I did, way back when all that seemed important was having a bag-full of marbles and a decent sized pile of comics to read.I'm not going to describe the plot (surely you know that!), nor am I going to go into great detail about how Lucas borrowed elements from the movies he loved to bring us his epic about a farm boy who becomes a legendary warrior; all I can say is that the film has lost none of its ability to astound and my kids sat entranced (despite not being able to follow the story without the benefit of some additional info from their sci-fi geek dad). My son (who is only three and a half ) might not understand what a 'rebellion' is, and my daughter (nearly six) may struggle with the concept of 'the force', but both got a kick from witnessing the whole Star Wars universe for the very first time.Chewbacca was an instant hit with my boy, whereas my girl identified with Leia, the gutsy princess. Both of them loved the brilliantly realised landscapes, aliens, robots and spaceships that have wowed film-fans for three decades (and who can blame themthe attention to detail and sheer creativity in design, costume, and make-up is staggering).It has since become evident that old George ain't always the greatest writer or director in the world (the last three Star Wars movies are proof of that); however, when he does get it right, he works miracles (he wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark tooanother solid gold movie).Star Wars is perfect family entertainment that delivers amazing spectacle, unforgettable characters and enough movie magic to last a lifetime. In fact, why not do yourself a favour: get off the internet and go watch it right now (even if you have seen it hundreds of times before).","

"hall895","25 May 2005","A classic story with a perfect cast, memorable score and dazzling special effects. Movies don't get any better than this. More space opera than true sci-fi, Star Wars takes you on a magical ride through a galaxy far, far away.The first moment of genius comes right at the very start with a written crawl which gives a basic plot outline and without which all that immediately followed would be hard to place in context. After John Williams' now legendary opening theme we are thrust into the first of many thrilling space battles to come. Almost immediately we are introduced to one of the great movie villains of all time, Darth Vader who is voiced with true menace by James Earl Jones, and it becomes clear that this film is not quite like anything we have seen before.Star Wars may seem to be your typical good versus evil swashbuckling adventure but there's a lot more going on here. The hero, Luke Skywalker, is your typical simple, clean-cut farm boy who will soon be thrust into the middle of a galactic war of as grand a scale as could be imagined. But he is not our only hero. Princess Leia, a leader of the rebellion against the evil Galactic Empire, is certainly not your typical helpless fairy-tale princess. She gives as good as she gets. Obi-Wan Kenobi is the older, wiser more seasoned hero and the mentor young Luke will desperately need. Han Solo is a space pirate in it only for the money, not for any revolution. Solo's first mate aboard his ship, the Milennium Falcon, is Chewbacca, a giant Wookiee who is remarkably adept at space flight for a creature which resembles a hairy two-legged dog. Also along for the ride to help our heroes are the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 who provide not only critical help for our heroes but some comic relief for the audience.The performances in Star Wars are all first-rate. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker plays the young, naive Skywalker very well and Hamill grows right along with the character throughout the film. Carrie Fisher brings the appropriate smarts, skills, sophistication and determination to Princess Leia. Without Fisher's quality performance it might be hard to believe that this young woman could play such a pivotal role in a rebellion of this magnitude. Alec Guinness is reliably brilliant as old Jedi master Kenobi. He is mysterious, quiet and reserved yet very strong indeed. Stealing the show is Harrison Ford as Han Solo. It seems Ford gets all the best lines and he makes the most of them. Luke Skywalker may be the nominal hero of the film but it is Ford as Solo from which Star Wars gets most of its personality.George Lucas has crafted a true masterpiece here. The classic struggle of the underdog against the evil oppressor takes on many new twists here. The mysterious Force, the foreboding and menacing Darth Vader, alien creatures of all imaginable shapes and sizes, the epic nature of a battle which rages across an entire galaxy...in the end it all comes together to form something unique and truly wonderful. With action and adventure on a grand scale, fascinating characters on both sides of the fight, special effects that were revolutionary for the time and an ever-building sense of drama and excitement Star Wars is an absolute triumph.","

"itamarscomix","24 September 2011","Before there was a trilogy, before there were prequels, before there was an expanded universe with hundreds of books, comics and video games, before Greedo shot first and before Jar Jar Bink was a speck of light in George Lucas' eye, there was Star Wars. Even if it's not the best film in the series (it's not), Star Wars deserves its own place in the history of cinema, as a work that changed Hollywood forever. It brought back the grandness of the epic cinema of the 30's and 40's and multiplied it, creating a new era of spectacle and excitement.Unlike the rest of the films, there's absolutely no need for an expanded universe or a complete saga to appreciate the original Star Wars by its own right. It's a complete tale, a classic saga that takes its queues from historical epics, samurai films and serials, and contains every aspect of the timeless hero's journey. The fact that it takes place 'in a galaxy far, far away' is trivial - though it did help the film have a bigger impact.Star Wars has very little to do with science fiction; not much of the science in it makes any sense, it might as well be magic. But that's what made it so powerful, and what made the prequels - that tried to explain everything away - so disappointing. Luke Skywalker's story is a classic story of the simple farm-boy who leaves his home and becomes a hero, and for that reason exactly it's timeless, and resonates with audiences even now.Now go see The Empire Strikes Back.","

"AlsExGal","11 July 2015","The latest TCM production entitled TCM Presents A Night at the Movies: George Lucas & The World of Fantasy Cinema, was really 2/3 about Lucas's films and it seemed that 2/3 of that was about Star Wars - but that was OK because it finally drove home to me what I have suspected for years - that George Lucas did not and does not have a clue as to what made Star Wars great. He got lucky with the first one (this film) because it was a product of its time and was what people WANTED to see in 1977 - something hopeful and fun. Remember - or maybe you are too young to remember - movies in the mid 70s were extremely cynical post Watergate and post Vietnam. This one was different and even religious in an ecumenical way. Lucas got lucky with the second one because of the director and his input. To me, all the ones that came after The Empire Strikes Back were special effects filled duds. Now back to the original.In that cynical era in which nothing was black and white and everything seemed at least gray and a little tainted came this little space western. The sound effects were hokie, the graphics were poorly rendered, and all of the creatures were real men and women in rubber suits not CGI. But that was not the point. The point was that HERE was a force of pure evil - The Empire - that everybody could be completely against. The heroes were imperfect yet you could rally around them. You have a young boy of about 19 who is treated well by his farming aunt and uncle but wants a bigger destiny, you have an old man living in the hills like a hermit that wants that young boy to join the fight against the empire, and not until The Empire touches the boy personally does he make a rather hasty decision to do so. There is a girl, a princess, who is not waiting for somebody to come rescue her and helpless. She's tough, she can handle a weapon, and she can handle the fourth in their little band, Han Solo, who sticks his neck out for nobody a la Casablanca's Rick Blaine and seems completely mercenary, yet he gets involved. If you like science fiction and good old fashioned adventure you'll like it. If you are young and feel that your destiny is slipping through your fingers and are itching to make a difference, or if you are older and want a chance to right a wrong that you feel at least partially responsible for you'll love it. And you CAN shoot first in the face of danger, have lived a pretty self involved life, change, and become the hero. As the 1977 original trailer said ""Star Wars - for the fun of it"" and for the philosophy of it too.","

"roghache","26 March 2006","This is an incredibly entertaining and well crafted space epic that has become a modern day legend and spawned several (for me, disappointing) sequels and prequels. This classic is a basic story of good versus evil, combined with a futuristic space setting and special effects. While it may be kind of fun to jokingly tell others 'May the force be with you', no one should seriously be getting their theology from it (as a few cult like followers seem to) since really, it's essentially a science fiction fairy tale.As everyone must surely know, this original Star Wars tells the story of a handsome young farm boy and our hero, Luke Skywalker, who teams up with Han Solo, Chewbacca, a couple of 'droids' (C-P3O and R2-D2), and of course the grand master, Obi-Wan Kenobi to protect the galaxy from the villainous Darth Vader and save the beautiful Princess Leia from the clutches of the Evil Empire.The movie became part of everyday life in the late 1970's and 1980's, and the phrase 'Evil Empire' so commonplace and universally understood that President Raegan used it to describe the Communist regime of the former Soviet Union. His proposed plans for defensive space weaponry even became known as the Star Wars missile defense program.The actors are all perfect in their roles. Mark Hamill gives a charming boy next door heroism to the young Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford a charismatic magnetism to Solo, Carrie Fisher a vulnerability, yet smart and feisty competence to the captive Princess, and Alec Guinness a mature wisdom to Kenobi. Of course the real stars of the show are C-P3O and R2-D2, an extremely lovable character who never actually speaks but simply pops and whistles. Each droid has a clearly defined personality and their interaction together is priceless.It's a great story with wonderfully noble, courageous heroes and dark, dreadful villains. Wonderful special effects of course and star fighting action sequences. In fact, the problem for me with the later Star Wars movies is that, apart from developing the character of Darth Vader and revealing the origin of his wickedness, the other films are primarily effects, star fighting, and galactic bars. Short on plot for adults, in my opinion. I really enjoyed this original picture, but found the prequels and sequels boring to sit through. Also, the Star Wars movies do not have anything comparable to the character interaction present in the Star Trek TV series or films, which I much prefer to Star Wars, even this original episode.However, George Lucas and his string of Star Wars pictures are a legend, and this first movie at least is a barrel of entertainment for both kids and adults.","

"Mr-Fusion","25 May 2015","In all honesty, I didn't plan on watching ""Star Wars"" on its 38th anniversary, but a happy accident nonetheless. To see this movie is to go back to a time when the mythology was in its nascent stages, before all the merchandising and parodies (really, a testament to its cultural impact, which is immense). It's deceptively simple; all of the classical elements are here - clearly defined heroes and villains, robots, space pirates, wizards, princesses, sorcery - remixed and flung off into a faraway galaxy. It all makes for a potent brew, to say the least. And when all is said and done, the movie's real power is its ability to tap into the kid in all of us. This is just plain fun, and not even Lucas' shoddy CGI rejiggering can tarnish that.9/10","

"OllieSuave-007","16 June 2007","This is the movie that probably changed sci-fi and fantasy films of the cinema, full of action, imagination, nostalgia, character development and charm. The 4th movie of the Star Wars trilogy, but the first and original Star Wars movie filmed, it starts with a ship being invaded by Darth Vader, who has kidnapped Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Later on, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) teams up with Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Ben Kenobi (Alec Guiness), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) in an attempt to rescue the Princess Leia, who leads a group of rebels to defy the evil empire controlled by a ruthless Sith Lord and guarded by his trusted servant, Darth Vader. They must also stop the Death Star from destroying the galaxy. The result is one huge mission to save the galaxy, supported by superb direction and story from George Lucas and a memorable music score from John Williams.Each character was given his/her unique purpose in the movie, but all are committed to achieving triumph of the dark forces of evil. This fast-paced movie gives the audience a break from the reality of the problematic world, and takes you to a journey into an imagination beyond belief.

"StevePulaski","23 March 2013","George Lucas' Star Wars is a project unlike one I've seen before, as cliché and as empty as that statement might sound. It's a monumental achievement in the cinematic world, arguably the biggest one ever, that pioneered special effects work and accommodated for other science-fiction projects to follow in the next decades. When released in 1977, with sufficient hype and outstanding reviews, it was a movie-going experience; thousands of showings were sold out (something you never hear about anymore), universal audiences were captivated, cultists and enthusiasts were born, and the eye-popping technology was cherished and admired by many.Watching Star Wars today (now called Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope with the release of the three prequels), there is still a uniquely affecting vibe that it sends with its compelling visuals and wonderfully articulated characters. It's over thirty years old, but it effectively holds the torch that makes it timeless. No matter how far technology progresses, and even with the onset of computer-animation and a heavy reliance on digital cinema, the look and beauty of Star Wars will likely never die out.Since it appears that everyone has seen the Star Wars movies except for myself, I will spare you the boredom of hearing the plot reiterated for the umpteenth time. Besides, I'm not sure if I could explain it accurately. The film is fast-paced, dynamic, and just works so competently, that after a while, I began to dissolve any questions I had about the plot and just go along for the ride. Consistent readers know what I think of constant cinematic evaluations, and that I find them to often be without a reward and potentially lethal to the likability of a film. Things happen in Star Wars; crazy things, logical things, smart things, frightening things, but above all, enthralling things.Speaking of enthralling things, I must admit how often I felt tension build and suspense become prevalent during the course of this film. For one thing, it's blatantly obvious to people who haven't even seen the series that these characters will make it (hence the two sequels). Yet, during several sequences, I found myself tense and extremely worried for these characters (most notably the scene in the trash chute). When a film can make you fear when you know the outcome is when you know true filmmaking tactics are at hand.Something I have notice happen with older science-fiction films is that one of their downsides is their length due to their special effects showcase. Let me explain; Star Trek: The Motion Picture was a visual marvel when it first came out, but its story was extended out about twenty-five minutes longer than it needed to be because they were showcasing the technology, which was breathtaking at the time. It appears, too, that many fans even recall this fact with a bit of sourness, which is why when people refer to the ""original trilogy"" of the Star Trek films, they usually mean the second film through the fourth one. Star Wars doesn't bear that same quality; it doesn't need to turn the story into a methodical plod just to show off its creative design and visuals. It doesn't feel like a showcase. We get a perfect feel for the environment without having to stare at for an upwards of five minutes.One thing that disheartens me greatly about this series is how controversial it has become. With numerous releases on DVD, and a new one on Blu-Ray, to my knowledge, the only original cuts of the Star Wars films you can see are on the Laserdisc/VHS versions. Because of this, fans have found themselves lambasting decisions made by Lucas, criticizing all the changes he has made to the series on the new releases of the DVDs, his re-releases of the movies in theaters, and lucrative branding/licensing of the figures in the money that, in 2013, continue to flood the store aisles of a Wal-Mart and Toys-R-Us near you. I believe that's one of the contributing reasons to why I never saw or even felt like seeing the original films until now; I felt alienated and bullied, with the series seemingly shoving itself down my throat.On a final note, another impressive element is the charisma and talent of a young Mark Hamill, portraying no one else but Luke Skywalker. Hamill seems like the kind of guy who, after breaking out in Lucas' trilogy of films, would have gone on to do unprecedented projects, but alas, no. Hamill has only acted in either small roles or cameos in films, and hasn't really worked on any other mainstream picture aside from the Star Wars trilogy. While this fact is slightly depressing, as one can only imagine what he could've done, it's fortunate we weren't burdened of seeing him in anything atrocious.Star Wars is, in short, an incorruptible masterpiece on film. A film that launched the genre of science fiction, propelling films about outer space to unheard of heights. It's just incredibly unfortunate to see what dismal treatment it, and its fans, have had to endure since its release.Starring: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford. Directed by: George Lucas.","

"tagerjd","24 July 2016","Star Wars Episode 4 A New Hope tells the story of a farm boy Luke Skywalker who upon his purchase of two droids R2-D2 and C3-P0, and running into the old and wise Obi-Wan Kenobi he is thrown into a world bigger then his own.A New Hope has great sense of pacing and having a flowing narrative build up to its conclusion almost flawlessly. The characters feel like real people with fleshed out motivations. The effects although aged today definably inspired what we have today in the art of cinema. The score just like all the other films in the saga is fantastic. But what this movies greatest feat is just how much it inspired a generation of cinema, as well as is outstanding impact on pop culture that keeps this film fresh.In spite of how much we can all appreciate this movies impact it is still far from a perfect movie. Most of the acting is hooky, and the effects are hard to by today. And although it has a good sense of pacing it still has many plot conveniences. The action is also pretty slow which prevents it from feeling like a real fight is going on. Even the dialogue is pretty hooky and hard to by. This is a problem because if characters are unable to talk like people do it makes it hard to relate to them and get invested in there conflicts.In conclusion I can appreciate its impact on culture, as well as love the movie. I personally consider myself to be a Star Wars fan. Keeping in mind that I feel on an objective level I consider this picture to be above average instead of great I'm giving this one a 6/10.","

"tomasg-69814","28 October 2017","George Lucas was exhausted - and had lost several pounds - when his finished work finally was to be shown to the public officially on the big screen.The recordings had been very troublesome, and was on a budget shoestring until the end. (Did it stop at 11 M $ ?) In 1977 the movie landscape was very well mixed, but It lacked Space Adventures who was far out there.Spielberg's ""Close Encounter"" from the same year did not speculate in fantasy as deep as Lucas' adventure; here we got a whole table of pure imagination and creativity from a guy who just wanted to show us the eternal battle between good and bad, dark and light, his way.And by 1977's standards and special effects options of the era: What an enjoyable classic!It's an adventure who has a good mood from start to finish. Great locations, great humour, great acting.Don't want to cherish the old trilogy in front of the ""sequels"", but it brings heck a lot more charming and warm feeling re-seeing those 77- 83 flicks.I leave it that way......""Star Wars"" is probably one of the 10 most important movies of the 20th century.","

"sharky_55","25 November 2015","Star Wars begins not with opening credits, as the guild would enforce in those days, but with a scrawl that has become legendary. Back then, it was a few lines of yellow text scrolling across a lengthy screen that would be photographed on the backdrop of an infinite star- field, losing itself in a vanishing point far, far away. A modest effect, yet those words instantly paint a picture so incredibly vivid that it would kick-start a hugely popular and successful franchise. And it is nothing without its iconic fanfare by John Williams. Take a listen to Holst's Mars movement and see how Williams transforms all the heroism, all the grandiosity and glory into one of the most recognisable themes of all time. And then we pan down and observe a little ship being pursued by a gigantic one, something so immediately identifiable, and we already are entranced.It is a film that is at once lifted and tainted by Lucas' love for it. We see an entire world envisioned, and the production design so effortlessly ushering us into this aged future. When we crash land in the desert planet Tatooine, we recognise the arid setting, before just a hint of alien and droid life instantly transports our minds to millions of stars and galaxies away. Something so simple as adding an extra sun bathes the horizon for miles and miles with an air of mystery and other worldliness. When we encounter civilisation of sorts, Lucas gently pushes in an intergalactic band, a sleazy bar, aliens and creatures of all sizes - the usual alcoholic suspects. And when we need to take to the skies, the matte painted backgrounds do much of the work; hordes of stormtrooper minions, a grimy and worn Millennium Falcon, the great big grey walls of the Death Star buzzing with machinery and lights. Lucas would later insert his own little (or not so) CGI creations not because of any real need, but because the technology was now available, but this only highlights how perfect the world-building was in the first place. The new digitally rendered beasts look impressive yet noticeable shiny and over- expressive in the worn and dusty Mos Eisley, and sometimes the camera will linger unnecessarily as if to say ""Look at what we can do now!"" But we had been long immersed before that.The story is of course a familiar one. It has roots in Joseph Campbell's Hero and Flash Gordon and even Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress; a story with mythic origins. And there are tell-tale signs of Lucas own American Graffiti a few years back. But Star Wars has evolved beyond those and becomes a treasure in its own right. The original created a world beyond the imaginable scope of that time, a sci-fi universe so living and breathing that people flocked again and again to experience it in theatres. Little details and mistakes become cultish and infamous themselves; the stormtrooper who bumps his head on the roof, Solo's comment about his ship's speed, and when a character's characterisation is marred, fans respond; Han shot first.Looking back on it years gone by, it is inescapable to notice the ageing special effects. That is simply a fact of changing technologies. Yet I still marvel on how impeccably and competently Star Wars is crafted. The sound design is alien and fantastically so; simple acts of pulling on steel cable and microphone interference create these iconic noises, and of course the bright and noisy hum of the lightsabers. Years on we had incoherent and frenetically choreographed battles that seem more like acrobatic dance recitals, and the blades of light flashed at a hundred miles an hour, but here we have Guinness characterised in these simple but powerful strokes, the intent on his face, the recognition of an old pupil, the concentration of a chess match as they probe for a weakness. The space-fight scenes are edited like a dogfight from WW2 with precision by Marcia Lucas (a remarkable presence you don't notice until her absence), and the simply act of placing these fighter pilots on the backdrop of a whizzing and laser filled backdrop is thrilling. As the motion control photography soars through the space and trenches of the death star, these miniatures and models looks immense and engaging.A gigantic bear-like creature and a small white droid speak not a word, but become fan favourites anyway. There is Darth Vader, who becomes even more menacing when comparing the original voice before the iconic wheezing of James Earl Jones was brought in. There is the plucky young hero, who's fate is only hinted at here, and it takes another two films for the story to become more mature, and his circle to complete. The roguish Han Solo is likewise expanded further in the sequels, as is his relationship with the Princess Leia as they continue to bicker. But is is here in this special film that it all began. The magic of Star Wars is that it takes place in a galaxy so far, far away, but it has become so close over the years, and so familiar.(Originally 9/10)","

"gregmovies","1 September 2008","Filled with great characters and a fun story, Star Wars is well deserving of its reputation as a classic. John Williams score alone makes this a film worth seeing. The characters are unforgettable and the special effects impressive for its time, but very outdated now. The different alien species are one of the best things about the film. The Cantina scene showing an array of Lucas' creations is particularly fun.I give this film a 7/10. Looking at it subjectively, it isn't a really good film. A lot of clichés, bad dialogue, cracker jack philosophy, and unimpressive acting. Yet, for some reason, I find it hard to say anything bad about this movie. My favorite film as a child, and one I still enjoy, mostly for nostalgia.","

"Laz75","1 February 2000","There's not much to say about this movie this is *THE* movie that changed it all.It's my favourite movie, and not only among the quadrilogy, among all movies; it has everything that can be great in a movie, great characters, great story, great sights, great special effects (they don't show 23 years) and a mythological background that made us dream for decades now, and that'll keep us dreaming for a long, long time. Maybe the characters I liked most in this one are Old Obi-Wan Kenobi, wonderfully portrayed by Alec Guinness, and Han Solo, Harrison Ford's first important role, they're both great.Not to mention John Williams' wonderful score, without of it, the movie wouldn't have been this great it's a perfect mix, that's what it is!","

"jdberkley","17 May 2006","Having read a lot of the other comments here, I have to say it's interesting to see how many people begin by saying how old they were when they saw ""Star Wars"" for the first time(Full disclosure: I was three. My parents saw it at a drive-in theatre, and all I can remember of that experience was seeing Darth Vader for the first time, and knowing that he was very, very bad). I think that speaks to its extraordinary impact. ""Star Wars"" was an event, I suppose in the way that the Beatles on Ed Sullivan for the first time was an event. It dates you, to a degree, but the reason it was important-- the reason it remains important-- is that it showed you what was possible. For much of the 1960s and 1970s, filmmakers had concentrated on showing us the brutal, heartbreaking truth of our world(The Godfather, Chinatown, Nashville-- some of the best movies ever made), and many of them succeeded brilliantly. But there's a place for dreaming dreams of things that have never been, too, and ""Star Wars"", with its epic tale of an Empire and a rebellion in a galaxy far, far away, was the dream a generation didn't know it wanted to have until George Lucas gave it to us.Is it juvenile, at times? Simplistic, even? Sure. So's the truth, sometimes. We want to believe there's a Force, and that Luke can master its use in time to defeat the forces of darkness. So we believe it. Are the effects a bit dated now? Sure, although I still believe them. Did the success of ""Star Wars"" possibly kick off the modern blockbuster era, which gives us more and more special-effects-drenched dreck every year? Sadly, it probably did. But the thing the wannabe heirs of ""Star Wars"" usually lack is the one thing that made ""Star Wars"" such an event--courage.Back in 1977, nobody was making movies like this. Nobody thought a film like this, with its mythic storytelling arc and its sweeping vision of intergalactic war, could possibly work...with the exception of George Lucas and his fellow filmmakers.I didn't know all that at the time, of course. Like I said, I was only three. But having watched more movies than most people my age now, I feel comfortable saying that in its way, ""Star Wars"" is as much an independent auteur's film as anything by John Cassavetes or Woody Allen-- it has the same sort of daring, the same desire not to settle for less than showing us something we've never seen before. A bold, grand sense of old-style craftsmanship infuses everything in ""Star Wars"", and the film delivers on the promise contained in its subtitle. At the time, it really was a new hope.","

"cosmorados","17 February 2011","A long time ago in a galaxy far far away a young farm boy named Luke Skywalker encounters two eccentric droids, gets attacked by sand people and is then saved by an old wizard by the name of Ben Kenobi. After a brief chat the farm boy discovers that Ben and Luke's father used to protect the universe as Jedi Knights until his father was killed by the evil Darth Vader. After his aunt and uncle are killed Luke realises his destiny has been chosen for him and he and Ben are going to have to take on the empire, and from this point movie history will never be the same again.Much has been said about this movie and it almost feels redundant to discuss it, but, as it was the first film I saw at the pictures I feel almost duty bound to add my two penneth to the mix and so I will. This film was groundbreaking in terms of effects, but what we have learnt since Star Wars is that all the good effects in the world can't save a poor movie. The thing that makes this movie as damned good as it is, is the mixture of urgent direction, wonderful performances, a damned good script, that often gets blasted as being terrible, (If it was the film would also be terrible ...it isn't, ergo sum ...), a pioneering use of sound effects that really reinforce the more alien characters with a real sense of emotion (specifically Chewbacca and R2-D2) but of course the last big star of the movie is John Williams sweeping epic score, which even today is probably one of the greatest pieces of movie music ever.These days I understand why a film like ""Casablanca"" and ""Citizen Kane"" cannot be appreciated by a modern audience because they are so hailed for their enormity on their first appearance that it often cannot be re-experienced by viewers after that. The first time we watch Star Wars we don't actually know that there is anything but Jawas on Tatooine, or that Obi-Wan Kenobi (That wizard's just a crazy old man) is a secret bad-@ss or that Han Solo, good for nothing mercenary, is seen right through by Jedi Knight Ben Kenobi. We who experienced it the first time will always feel it again, but the modern audience, who know so much about the film, cannot.The film is full of classic moments, from Ben Kenobi's reveal, R2-D2's fall, Luke switching off his targeting computer, Han's constant irreverent humour, Ben's ""that's no moon"", and a dozen more, but even after all these years my favourite moment is that knowing look that Ben gives Luke at the end of his duel with Vader. His wry smile and the blend of music and performance by both Hamill and Guiness is sensational and still gives me goose bumps now. Amazing.Since then the impact of the original three may have been watered down by the prequels, but as much as you can't polish a turd, you also cannot dim the brightest star. Which is why the term ""May the force be with you"" will always mean so much to so many.","

"hmorales","3 December 1998","In respect to the many kids of the seventies. I rated this movie as one of the greatest movies ever made. I was thirteen and enjoyed this fantasy getaway more than I could count. Like many other kids of the seventies you left reality before walking into the theatre and escaped into the adventure once the reels begin rolling. It provided the special effects and excitement a kid was looking for. Even today when I watch this movie on VHS I recall those times. Whenever I get the chance to watch it I feel like that eager thirteen year old over and over again. I hope the new movies will meet the same expectations of kids of  this decade and the next.","

"joshuadrake-39480","27 April 2015","STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE is a film that I really enjoyed when I first saw it and I knew from the beginning I would love it and this was the first in a much bigger series and the fourth film in the STAR WARS franchise overall (in chronological order).The story is amazing for a 2 hour film and the film does not feel like it's 2 hours because it goes by really quick and I really think it's just amazing and spectacular and fantastically well-made and there are reasons why it is the best movie of all time and it's the best film ever made.THE CHARACTERS: Luke Skywalker is our main protagonist and he is played by Mark Hamill and he is really spectacular. He is my favorite character, along with Yoda, Chewbacca, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Darth Vader, C3PO and R2D2, Mace Windu, Padme, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Emperor Palpatine.Hamill does not fail in anything and his performance was really great and just amazing. Carrie Fisher was really fantastic as Princess Leia and she is not the normal damsel-in-distress in today's movies and she was the right choice for the character. Harrison Ford is really nice as Han Solo and all three actors would later become famous for their roles in these films and they really do a very well good job.Harrison Ford would play both Han Solo in the original STAR WARS trilogy and Indiana Jones in the INDIANA JONES franchise, which I will get to.The next performance is the late Alec Guiness in the best role of his career as Obi-Wan Kenobi and he should have won an Oscar for his part. Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Peter Mayhew plays C3PO, R2-D2 and Chewbacca in this film and they do a really outstanding job.George Lucas does a very good job creating an epic space opera series that starts off with the middle of the series and that is not possible in today's film making world, but was possible for 1977 and he does a very good job writing and directing and the screenplay he wrote is one of the best screenplays that I have ever read before in my life.John Williams composed one of the greatest musical scores ever created for a film and his Star Wars theme song is one of my favorite musical themes ever credits.The visual effects back then were amazing and so were the lightsaber battles and the dogfight sequences and they were really cool back in 1977 and it was really cool and just amazingly created and today, they still look amazingly well-done. I have seen the 1997 special edition of this film and I think it is really good, but I also love the theatrical version is just really cool and just fantastic.Overall, I love STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE and the movie is getting a 10 out of 10 from me because everything is just really great and fantastic to inspire a lot of filmmakers including Christopher Nolan, Joss Whedon, Ridley Scott, James Cameron, John Singleton, Dean Devlin and Peter Jackson and it also inspired future filmmakers including myself.It's a smash hit, 10/10.","

"DarthVoorhees","20 June 2005","One word can describe Star Wars...Perfection with a capital P! Star Wars is so perfectly molded together filled with pieces all so crucial yet all so wonderful,John William's A+++ score, or James Earl Jones' powerful voice.Really George Lucas' picture should be put next to the word Lucky in the dictionary.He had such a bizarre concept,and people had doubts.I mean if he was pitching Star Wars to me I would too.Yet this is the Little Movie that Could so to say.The acting is A+,my personal favorite performance is Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan Kenobi.People would argue about Geogre Lucas not being a great director after the infamous Prequels,that's a load of B.S.Lucas pours his imagination on the screen and the audience is captivated.We have to give a standing ovation to ILM which started in the 70's with Star Wars.The movie is still amazing to look at nearly 30 years later and with C.G.I in the movie making mix.The plot sounds bizarre on paper but it works wonders on screen and flows quickly,I don't believe I have ever checked my watch while watching Star Wars.I have to applaud Mr.Lucas,Star Wars has fueled the imaginations of many and will continue to fuel generations to come.One moment can describe the impact of the whole Star Wars experience/impact for me,the scene where Luke looks into the setting suns accompanied by William's brilliant score.It's a very moving scene.I really think it tells you to look out for more in your life to become something so to say.Star Wars can only be surpassed by it's sequel Empire Strikes Back but looking back at both I think they are even.Empire Stikes Back and Star Wars are in my opinion the best movies ever made10/10","

"k_g_barreto","29 August 2019","In 1977 Star Wars was released and 40 years after its release, pop culture still feels the impact that Star Wars brought it. Fantasy and sci-fi was combined in this classic cult, but the most charming thing about this movie is its characters, although being just introduced and not developed, but that's not a problem at all, in the following episodes they gained more development and deepth. Luke, Han, Leia and Kenobi were all interesting characters, and C3PO and R-2D2 are the most charismatic characters of the movie. Darth Vader, with such a magnificent and well-done design, have a strong presence in screen and keeps you interested about what are his motivations and backgroung, aside from what Obi-Wan told about him in the beginning, we don't know so much about the character.The movie is something unique and keeps you captivated from the very first minute, first with the opening crawl text, and then with the Rebellion's ship looking so small before the imposing and powerful Star Destroyer of the Empire, and now on you're on great piece of pop art. George Lucas marvelously manage to entertain with his space opera adventure, inspired by the Flash Gordon films, and the movie follow ""The Hero's Journey"" structure, from the work of Joseph Campbell ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces"", structure that now are already done beacause of its countless uses.The visual effects, something pioneering from its time, are astonishing, even to today's standards, I think, and of course I'm removing the changes that George Lucas has it done in the DVD and Blu-Ray releases, as the addition of Jabba the Hutt.The soundtrack of John Williams adds SO MUCH to the film. The theme song of Star Wars is something that everyone knows because of how iconic it is, and sounds like a anthem. The scene when Luke is looking at the sunset of Tatooine, and then The Force Theme begins to plays, is really, really something special and out of this world, and I know that everyone had goosebumps when seem it.The cultural relevance of Star Wars will continue to the foreeable future, and it's all thanks to George Lucas and this incredible movie, that will be relevant to generations to come. A New Hope is timeless, wonderful and one of the best fantasy movies to ever exist.","

"griffolyon12","13 October 2007","Star Wars, now known as Episode IV: A New Hope, is the perfect showcase of everything that makes a movie great. It is one of those occasions where everything in the film seems to of perfectly fell in place(although if you know the story behind the making of it, it wasn't so smooth). The acting, directing, writing, production design, special effects, and anything else I've forgotten, is simply top-notch. This movie did so many things for film, most notably the special effects, but it also gave us three of the greatest young actors of the late 70s and 80s, Mark Hammill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford. Then the film also created the blockbuster, and is the definition of what a blockbuster should be(humor, emotion, action, heart). On the last point the action is probably the most exhilarating and exciting action I've ever seen on film, the Death Star Trench Run is the definite highlight of the film. This film is just simply superb and is picture perfect, and is definitely one of the greatest and most memorable films of all-time. It's hard to believe that this all sprung from one man's imagination, George Lucas(writer/director of the film). STAR WARS!!!!!!!!! Rating: A picture perfect 10 out of 10!!!!!!!","

"ccthemovieman-1","10 June 2006","After seeing all six episodes of the Star Wars saga several times apiece, I still think this initial entry is interesting but one of weaker ones in the series. Perhaps that's because by now, the special-effects look primitive but also because it's a little slow in parts, slower than the other five films. Sometimes, though, it's nice to have more lulls as these modern-day action films many times overdo the violence. This one, however, is just a bit too slow overall.The first hour of this film sets up the second hour plus the two sequels that followed in the 1980s, showing how the principal characters were united, who they are fighting against and what mystical powers they have at their disposal. Note: it was even interesting to watch this film decades later after the final installment, episode 3, was viewed. It made this first entry make a little more sense, knowing the complete story (who was related to whom, how some died, etc.). It was also a shock to go back and see the special-effects in here after viewing those final three films issued in recent years.I always got annoyed, to be honest, at two things in this initial Star Wars film I felt were overdone: the ""Rambo"" mentality in which hundreds of shots are fired at the good guys and never hit them and the constant arguing between Carrie Fisher (""Princess Leia"") and Harrison Ford (""Han Solo""). By the third film, thankfully, that bickering stopped and everyone was ""on the same page.""Despite how old this film is, it's a ""must"" for this collection since it sets up so much of what is to follow. It's also kind of fun to look at this again and see how young everyone looks!","

"David_del_Real_Reviews_in_IMDb","15 December 2017","Forty years ago, screens of cinemas around the world got full of action, science fiction and fantasy with the premier of the STAR WARS movie, the one that the world would later know as Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope. It told us a story that despite the fact of being extremely futuristic, his creator did not set it as happening in a distant future but in a long forgotten past in a galaxy far away from here.This review intends to celebrate the 40 years of the beginning of one of the best trilogies of all time and present a personal point of view of why this first trilogy of films ; A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi is so beloved among the fans and why it couldn´t be matched by its prequel trilogy and it doesn´t seem as if it could be matched by its sequel whose first episode was released two years ago. That is also, why I must warn you that this text contains spoilers of the whole trilogy and small details of the other two, nevertheless, if you are like more or less the 95% of the people in what we call ""civilized world"" you have already seen this first trilogy and my little spoilers will not be a problem.------- -------- -------STAR WARS; Episode 4: A New hope... ... told us the story of Luke Skywalker, a leading hero that in my opinion, was not even closely matched by Anakin Skywalker (his father) in the prequels that were released later and I don´t think judging for what we know so far that he could ever be matched by Rey (in the sequels to come) because of a simple fact: The three leading heroes: Luke, Anakin and Rey are desperate to find their path in life, but only Luke is desperate to follow the path of a hero. This is not something that is necessarily implied in the dialogues, but something we feel along the movies. Anakin and Rey are desperate to understand the world around them, and in this sense they are not different to most people nowadays, but Luke wants to know if something can be done to help. Yoda says that Luke is always looking "" to the future, to the horizon"", and even when he says it as a reprimand, this quote also implies that Luke thinks that the world can go better than it usually does in the present state of things.Anakin was in theory the ""Chosen One"", Luke chose himself among two possible choices of redemption for the galaxy, even when he didn´t know at first that ""there was another one"". George Lucas has confirmed that Anakin was the Chosen One and that the prophesy is true, because as Darth Vader, Anakin destroyed the Sith that in that point were the Emperor and himself (in Return of the Jedi) , but IMO, that means that Anakin, or Darth Vader is only the Chosen One from a very technical point of view, as it was really Luke and the Rebellion who defeated them and if Darth hadn´t saved Luke from the Emperor, they would have nevertheless most probably perished with the destruction of the second Death Star, being most of the merit LUKE´S!Now, besides being Luke a more likable hero that both of his counterparts (Anakin and Rey) and having given the main reasons to think why this is so in the last paragraph, I think that this first Star Wars trilogy did something that no other movie franchise has ever done, being the closest achievement that of the Matrix trilogy: It presents universal teachings and wisdom in a non-segregative format. Its teachings could well belong to Christianity, Buddhism, Shinto, Islam, Wicca or even some martial arts like Aikido or Karate and nevertheless these teachings are not necessarily linked to any of them; it was the first time that we saw a movie that tried to merge all the wisdom from different cultures and present a kind of ""Universal Wisdom"". And that is, in my opinion, more than the great visual effects, its amazing Light Sabers or its interesting characters why this movie and the next two conforming the first trilogy will always be so important ; because of its philosophical value: they gave us a story that tried to synthesize teachings from a lot of religions and cultures and present them in a simple and amusing way.

"delibebek","28 April 2009","It's what movies are all about, really - sitting in a seat that's already been worn in by a thousand other tushes, crunching as much popcorn under your feet as you crunch in your mouth by handfuls, sipping a soda that's three times as big as you would ever really need... and then there's this very quiet little opening line written on the screen, like a new way of saying ""once upon a time..."" and you know the fairy tale is beginning, but before you can even get ready to get interested, that fateful, stirring, uplifting and scary chord throws you deep into your seat, in time with a logo that's too big for the screen... and the rest is just a ride. That's what movies are all about and that's what Star Wars gave us.If you never saw it in the theater, get yourself a really great audio visual system in your house, pour soft drinks on the floor (prep this a day prior to get the proper sticky effect) put too much salt and too much butter on a bucket of popcorn that's too big, and hit the ""play"" button on the remote.","

"SmileysWorld","13 March 2005","This film came along at just the right time for me.Upon it's initial release in 1977,I was 12 years old,which is the perfect age to see something this eye opening and different.I remember sitting and watching with just as much awe and amazement as perhaps 12 year olds from past generations seeing their first cowboy movie.I remember the thrills as though I saw it fresh yesterday.Upon seeing it again recently for the first time in many years,now well into my adulthood,I find,unfortunately,that the thrill that came with my first viewing did not come with me across the years.Despite this fact,I still saw a great film,one worthy of any home library.It's suspenseful,thrilling,and contains a great story line and interesting characters that we care about.It was great looking back on Harrison Ford when his hair wasn't quite so gray,Mark Hamill,whom we all thought would go on to be a great film star,though he has done little beyond this trilogy,Carrie Fisher, and,at least in voice,James Earl Jones(Darth Vader).Though the initial childhood thrill is gone,this is still a great film.","

"tedg","29 September 2002","I recently revisited this, and remembered first seeing it. It wasn't the first movie to be heavily hyped. But I recall it as the first one to appeal to kids as a big adventure.In a couple ways, what's come since have ruined this. Lucas himself ruined it by deciding to make all those extra ones, making up the story as he went. And of course, every month on average we now have a new special effects movie that matches the star wars franchise in visual ambition. Many of these in fact are fueled by Lucas' several companies.So its impossible to recapture that thrill. At the time, yes we knew he stole from Kurosawa, and leaned heavily on Joseph Campbell's notions of myth. But it all seemed so fresh, and Lucas himself came across as a visionary genius. And we needed that more than we needed entertainment.Remember, the US had just been through its first sleazy republican scandal and the nation as a whole was discouraged. But the world of movies was exploding. Woody Allen gave us ""Annie Hall."" Scorcese became known. And then this. The thing that impressed us at the time was how seriously it took itself, despite how childishly goofy that intergalactic bar was. Also how powerful the sounds and images were.The mythology was so clear. We had it for decades in science fiction and fantasy novels, indeed much better. But this was the first time we had them cinematically, and cinema when it works may be the most powerful of packaged imaginations. Oh how I wish we could see it as we did then.Now we notice, for instance, how ordinary the dogfights are. These used to thrill. We don't have all the mystery that made the thing deep. Now we know who everyone is and what is going on, and it is all so much more ordinary than what we imagined at the time as possibilities.In later years, Lucas would let us down, as a person and in this saga. In fact, I think he ruined some things. But for the year of this event, he was the most celebrated singer in the choir. And by me as well.What do I mean about ruining? Things evolve. When one thing finds a niche and flourishes, it pinches off other things. When ""Birth of a Nation"" became a huge success, it froze movies as filmed plays with a larger stage instead of one of the several other directions it could have taken. Again, there was a period after talkies reinvented the medium where there was a struggle among various different directions. This you can clearly see in the period. In retrospect, it appears as if the world could have only turned out the way it did. But the trends that win aren't the best at all.So ""Star Wars"" opened up a gateway for how effects could transform cinema into something far beyond what we had before. And then it closed that gateway, so that effects now cannot show you something unfamiliar. Instead, it all has to be the familiar taken to some extreme.Yes, it was a goose at the time. But Star Wars killed the greater possibilities of science fiction. In film, at least, and because books are inherently cinematic now, in books too.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","

"davidsarah","12 December 2004","Star wars made epic fantasy real. For a generation of people it has defined what the cinema experience is meant to be. Today it is probable that pc games will offer a deeper and more satisfying entertainment solution, but for pure visual and aural pleasure, mixed with basic emotional manipulation, there has never and will never be a better example of cinema than when star wars appeared over 25 years ago. When you think of star wars, you must remember what else was happening at the time. In America, the war in Vietnam had been lost. In the U.K economic disaster was occurring(a 3 day working week, and the army collecting rubbish). It was almost like the two most technically advanced countries in the world were going backwards. Star wars let everybody escape from that reality and reach for a future that was uncertain but ultimately good.","

"toqtaqiya2","5 October 2010","George Lucas spent four years developing and working on the galactic fantasy Star Wars. This was after he directed the dystopian science-fiction film THX 1138 (1971) and the rites-of-passage American Graffiti (1973). Star Wars was inspired by the Flash Gordon cartoon strip. It cost $8 million to make in Britain with three little-known Americans in the leading roles, supported by British actors. The story is a simple adventure yarn, and Lucas draws on samurai films, Westerns and every kind of myth, ancient and modern. The dogfights are based on a close study of World War II films. Star Wars was an immediate success. It became one of the great phenomena of cinematic history. It spawned two sequels, three prequels and endless imitators, creating a demand for spectacular blockbusters that has not yet ended. Industrial Light and Magic, the special effects unit that served the film, became a multi-billion dollar organization. Lucas himself also became and has remained one of Hollywood's most powerful figures. The film certainly struck a nerve in an America recovering from the humiliations of the Vietnam war. Ronald Reagan, elected president three years after Star Wars was made, spoke of the Soviet Union as 'the Evil Empire' and gave his proposed space-defense system the title Star Wars. The original Star Wars trilogy contributed to the worldwide renewal of the filmgoing habit, but in creating an appetite for child-like blockbusters that depend on special effects rather than on character and subtle narrative, the film unfortunately played a key role in what was to be called 'the dumbing down' of America and popular culture.","

"Jackie-Kennedy","6 February 2007","All folklore no matter where you come from as several basic tenants. You have the hero, the villain, the damsel in distress, , sidekicks, minions, guides, heroic battles, tragedies and victories. Good stories but hardly the stuff of a blockbusting movie. Or is it...? How on earth to take something as basic as a Good-vs-Evil Hero-vs-Villain story and make a movie that will capture imaginations? It can't be done can it? You just can't do it? Well yes actually you can. If you're George Lucas.I was but a babe in arms when the incredible triumph that is the Star Wars Saga was wowing generations of movie-goers worldwide.But although I didn't experience it on the Big Screen I can honestly say I fully understand and appreciate Lucas genius today 20 years on.I can honestly say I have yet to see another Saga measure up to Star Wars in both its look and its content.The premise of course the story of a young farm boy Luke Skywalker, wonderfully played by a young Mark Hamill who captures Luke's frustrations and desires perfectly.Young Luke seems destined to spend his life on his Uncle's farm on the remote planet of Tatooine doing chores but he dreams off more. He longs to be a pilot and see the universe. But that seems to be nothing more than a dream.That is until a chance meeting with two droids called C3PO and R2D2 results in his befriending an old hermit by the name of Ben Kenobi( Sir Alec Guiness) changing his life forever. For the old Hermit is in fact a great Jedi warrior called Obi-Wan Kenobi and the droids carry a distress message from a Princess on a Star Ship under the captivity of the Galactic Empire and it's ruthless leader Darth Vadar. Now Luke will leave his home and begin an adventure he could only have dreamed of, make new friends and learn things about himself and his family that he never knew were possible.Thus began one of the greatest movie adventures of all time and thus were created some of modern cinema's most memorable characters. All the folklore-type characters are present in Lucas masterpiece but he has managed to change and alter them enough to fit his incredible vision.The Hero of course is young Luke. Spirited and dreamer, Luke is also fiercely brave and loyal and something of an adventurer. He is also desperate to learn more about his Father, about whom his Aunt and Uncle refuse to speak.Mark Hamil is top notch in the role.The Damsel in distress is the Plucky Princess Leia , played with gusto by the then just 19 year old Carrie Fisher. Leia is the sender of the message that changes Luke's life. She is a member of a Rebel Alliance formed to oppose the mighty Galactic Empire and she was carrying the plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon , the dreaded Death Star to members of the her Alliance when the Imperial Fleet attacked her convoy.Little do either she or Luke know that they are connected by more than the droids.Luke also acquires a side-kick in the form of the smart, selfish rouge Han Solo. Smuggler and skilled pilot Han also proves to be a useful ally and a firm friendship is formed between the seasoned Solo and the young idealistic Jedi-in-Training. Solo is played by the ever wonderful Harrison Ford who lends just the right amount of sarcastic selfishness to an essentially good lovable character.Sir Alec Guiness is a cinematic legend and his wise old Jedi Knight is yet another fine performance from this seasoned veteran. Just mysterious enough to make you wonder just who he is and what he knows ( you learn more in EpV) he is also wise and a comfort to Luke ( and indeed the viewer) as he guides the young man ( and us) through his development as a Jedi and a man.Star Wars also gave rise to perhaps one of cinema's most iconic and best loved Villains. His almost mechanical breathing and deep sinister voice ( courtesy of James Earl Jones) have made Darth Vadar the best loved of all villains and indeed the most feared. At this time he is in command of the Imperial Fleet and rules the Empire with an Iron fist. All in black with that fearsome mask he is the epitome of the Dark Side and is wonderfully brought to life by Earl-Jones and David Prowse who wears the suit.And of course as we see later on he is also one of the most human and pitiful characters in the Saga despite being more man then machine.He will become Luke's biggest threat but also his strongest connection, a connection Luke never dreamed he would find but the last he wants to have.This was a new genre of film, Sci-Fi mixed with Fantasy and it worked a charm. The world was, and indeed still is, captivated, and its easy to see why. Its got action, suspense, romance, humor, danger and fear. And all this from Lucas twin interests in Space Travel and Folklore combined with a love for and real skill at making movies. The Saga, so wonderfully brought full circle with parts 1,2 and 3 recently , took off from the base so amazingly created in A New Hope and has gone from strength to strength ever since. This film is a wonder of modern film and I firmly believe it will stand the test of time.","

"FlikJedi719","2 January 2020","A New Hope will forever go down in history as the start of one of the greatest cinematic adventures of all time. This movie is everything - from characters, to character development, to the introduction of John Williams' famous score, to crafting a great conflict between the protagonist and antagonist.The character development of Luke Skywalker in this movie alone shows nothing less than great storytelling. At the start of this movie, Luke just wanted to go to the ""Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!"", and by the end of the movie he's using the force to help destroy the greatest weapon of all time: ""That's no moon. It's a space station.""While I was not alive in 1977, I can only imagine the audiences reaction after seeing this gem of a film. It has lived on from generation to generation, and still generates awe inspiring wonder from a story told ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....""Final grade: Easily a 9/10","

"CinemaClown","19 January 2016","This is the film that started it all. The first instalment in the Star Wars saga that would later go on to revolutionise its genre, change the landscape blockbuster filmmaking & become a cultural phenomenon, Star Wars (also known as Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope) is a cinematic feat of imagination, vision & creativity that hypnotized an entire generation with its freshly envisioned & awe-inspiring world, first-rate adventure, interesting characters, state-of-the-art visuals & an epic soundtrack.Having no nostalgic relation whatsoever with this epic space opera, all I can say is that my first stint with Star Wars didn't go as well as I anticipated. Where others heaped praise upon its visual effects, set pieces & other stuff, I found it to be a picture that wasn't just awfully dated but also terribly juvenile, filled with cartoonish creatures, unintentionally hilarious & pretty mediocre in all departments. The ingredients that made it a revolution of its time are visible beneath its degraded visuals but it's not as timeless as they say it is.Set in a galaxy far far away, Star Wars finds the galaxy in a state of civil war for a conflict brews between the Galactic Empire & the Rebel Alliance. The plot focuses on Luke Skywalker, a young boy on a desert planet who inadvertently acquires a pair of droids that possess vital information from Princess Leia regarding the Empire's latest weapon plus her request for help, following which he joins forces with a Jedi Knight, a couple of smugglers & his two droids to rescue the princess from the evil Darth Vader and save the galaxy from the Empire's tyranny.Written & directed by George Lucas, Star Wars is his pet project that permanently engraved his name in the annals of cinema and later spawned a franchise that would go on to redefine epic filmmaking. What's commendable is the mythology Lucas created from the scratch, taking inspirations from different sources but adding an original touch to it. The movie features a simple good vs evil storyline, but what elevates it above mediocrity is its then-sweeping special effects, innovative filmmaking techniques, fascinating set pieces, stunning score, few excellent characterisations & a sense of something new yet familiar.Considering the time it was released, Production design team makes efficient use of its limited budget to come up with wonderfully detailed set pieces, the stupid-looking aliens are brought to life with puppetry or whatever means was available back then, Cinematography exhibits some inventiveness which is quite evident from the first frame. Visual effects was groundbreaking in the 1970s but has severely degraded over the years and looks very cartoonish nowadays. Editing provides a consistent pace & fine flow to its narrative but its 121 minutes can become suffocating if you're not intrigued by its fantasy world.And then there is John Williams who contributes with an iconic score that evokes a sense of epicness at all times plus his soundtrack comprises of tracks that beautifully compliment the story's adventurous ambiance. Coming to the performances, Star Wars is notable for launching the acting career of many and features quite an ensemble in Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guinness & others who chip in with fine inputs in their given roles. Although nearly all the characters present in this film became part of the modern culture, Darth Vader is the only one that was impressive in my opinion, plus James Earl Jones' voice did add an intimidating quality to him.On an overall scale, Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope may not look as dazzling & revolutionary today as it was during its time of release but its influence on later sci-fi space operas & other films cannot be understated. For me, this was more or less disappointing for its severely outdated visual encapsulation never allowed me to take any of the unfolding events seriously and for the most part, it was downright laughable. It may have evoked an entirely different reaction from me if I had seen it at least 15 years ago but as of now, even though the effect of Star Wars on its genre, blockbusters & film marketing can still be felt, I feel no love for the saga that many happen to be so crazy about.","

"kantvors","29 August 2019","This movie immediately captures your attention with an incredible starting sequence after which you're left wondering what is going on. It sets up not just the story at hand, but a whole world far, far away. What makes this movie shine are the memorable settings, characters and locations. The effects were ahead of its time, but have not aged well. This shows the most during fight scenes. They are not choreographed very well and look just like a couple of old dudes trying to punch each other with sticks. It's done so much better in the prequels, less so in the new movies. The lightsabers feel like a traditional novelty more than like a weapon feared by the galaxy. What the movie does very well are its twists and pacing. Highly recommended, but not nearly as good a watch today compared to the prequels, which you should start with in my opinion.","

"bobsteimle","29 June 2005","From a scientific point of view, C3PO is as silly as you can get, from the way he looks and walks to the ridiculous things he says. He goes from berating his friend, R2D2, to worrying for his safety, from calling him incompetent to saying ""I knew you could do it"" when R2 eventually saves them all. Aside from the incessant whining of Luke, who manages to be funny without having a sense of humor, we relate to him. We feel the frustration he feels when he is stuck on the farm, the pain he feels from the death of his aunt and uncle and later when he loses Ben Kenobi.The waving of blasters with flashes of light which are obviously added later, the terrible aim of anyone shooting at our main characters, and the big presentation of awards to our heroes at the end of the movie make me feel retarded for liking this film so much. But the pure goodness of the good guys (except for Han) makes me want them to win and makes me glad when they do. They're trying to save us all from the evil empire. Star Wars is so popular because most of us want to be the good guys, the ones who risk everything to do the right thing for the right reason and be appreciated by the people we save. This is the reason Spiderman was so enormously popular. He's just a kid who has some moral goodness, whom we can be proud of. Most of us would love to be Luke Skywalker.","

"Boba_Fett1138","30 April 2005","Next to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" this is the most influential science-fiction movie of all time.Yet the movie is way more than just simple science-fiction. It's adventurous, epic, fantasy sparkling. The characters and settings are amazing and are truly something that should speak to your imagination. When you just think about it makes you realize how brilliant and ingenious the story and the movie actually is. Sure, it's obvious that George Lucas was obviously inspired by ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Kakushi toride no san akunin"" but Lucas knows to put in such great and original moments and characters that the movie still deserves much credit for its originality. Basically Lucas came up with an entire non-exciting universe complete with planets, races, technology and politics.""Star Wars"" is one of those rare movies in which everything works; The story, the characters, the pace, everything makes sense and work well together and are what make ""Star Wars"" a rare movie that in a way changed the way we look at movies.The movie is well casted. Casting Harrison Ford as Han Solo is probably the best choice of the entire movie. He's perfect as arrogant space pirate and extremely believable in his role. Casting old school actors Alec Guiness and Peter Cushing was also a great move. Alec Guiness is perfect as the old mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi and Peter Cushing is brilliant as Grand Moff Tarkin, next to the emperor the only person who dares to speak up to the biggest villain of the galaxy Darth Vader. In a way he is an even bigger bad guy than Vader in this movie. But still there is no denying that Darth Vader is really the ultimate bad guy. Never has there been a movie with a better bad guy. Vader's character introduction alone is what him a classic character already. And then there is his suit, it makes him mysterious and ultimately evil looking. How can there ever be a bigger bad guy than him?What make the movie work more than anything is the brilliant music by John Williams. He knows to come up with some amazing and some of the most recognizable theme's in movie history. His musical score is what makes most of the scene's work and is truly a tool that helps to tell the story. Like in all Star Wars music, his music is present throughout the entire movie, one of the reasons why Star Wars is also sometime's regarded as a space opera.The special effects are truly amazing, even these days. The final space battle with the death star is really one of the greatest special effects achievements and really edge of your seat stuff.The people that worked behind the camera are the one's who deserve the most credit for the cinematic classic that ""Star Wars"" has become. People that worked on the special effects like the ILM guys and persons such as John Dykstra, Dennis Muren, Joe Johnston and John Knoll, paint artist Ralph McQuarrie, production designer John Barry, make-up artist Rick Baker, composer John Williams and of course director and writer and person ultimately responsible for the huge success of it all; George Lucas.I seriously really could go on and on for ever about the brilliance of this movie but I'm afraid that I'll probably bore a lot of people with that. The brilliance of everything about this movie is simply something you've to experience for yourself and luckily a lot of people already have. ""Star Wars"" is really one of those you movies you simply have to see at least once in your life.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","

"deloudelouvain","6 April 2020","After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, and Rogue One, it's now time for A New Hope. I get it that it's the oldest one and so the special effects are not of the same level as more recent ones but from all the ones I watched by now I thought this was the weakest one. I probably watched it as a kid and gave up after that as it's just not that good. I don't know why this one gets such a high rating, it's definitely not better than any of the previous titles mentioned. I agree that the used special effects at that time might have looked good for 1977 but still it doesn't make it better. For that the story and the acting were just not of the same quality. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing.The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the sixth movie of eleven in barely 48 hours for me, next one today will be The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi in the hope the quality improves compared to this one, looking forward to it.","

As there were rarely movies from space it seemed at the time.Mark Hamil as the main protagonist Luke Skywalker who went from being a simple farm boy to being a grown up man and really stronger and tougher but had a sense of morals and values as he was the most developed character of all the main characters.Carrie Fisher as the feisty yet pretty and tough action gal Princess Leia. As she really should had moved on and had the acting chops but people will forever remember her as Princess Leia no matter what.Harrison Ford as the tough, dashing, a bit of a jerk but with a heart of gold space pirate, Han Solo. Who really began to mellow out and proved to his friends that he was not such a macho jerk and really had a heart of gold.Darth Vader who only had twelve minutes of screen time in the first movie. Really began to also develop. As he knew he had good inside of him but was afraid to show it.And of course scene stealers like C3P0 and R2-D2. As R2D2 is funny even though we can't hear a word he is saying but only C3PO is the only one that can as C3P0 is the perfect sidekick and straight man for scene stealing R2.The movie had wit, charm, personality, and special effects! Wished that both Hamil and Fisher would had gone on further in their careers like Ford did!","

"Spondonman","10 November 2013","I saw this marvellously old-fashioned hokum with my girlfriend at the packed out Pics on March 25th 1978. Exhausted at all the screen wipes by the end all we were thinking of was hopefully not waiting too long in the cold for the last bus home; so much for intergalactic travel. Star Wars was a phenomena then, and still is – although I did warn a big fan I knew at the time that it wouldn't take too long for the special effects to go dog-eared with age and even recommended Kurosawa's original to him instead. However, he probably still disdainfully thinks, along with many others that movies, indeed history, began with Star Wars.Young stereotype joins forces with a disparate group of stereotypes to save the white universe and Princess Stereotype from stereotypical space baddies in a adventurous story bordering on corny with then innovative now dated film technology. Definitely nothing wrong with any of that, just that when stripped down it's not only incredible but incredibly ordinary and merely reflects back to me some lovely sunny days from the mid '70's. Even the sinister ugly aliens had somehow listened to the cleaner music of Frank Zappa. Fancy spending trillions of trillions on an immense battleship complete with a titchy flue with a security implication. I saw Lucas's 90's cgi cartoonery revision at the Pics with my daughter, the spacecraft still wobbled and there were many white borders on display but overall his team had done a good job trying to stem the onslaughts of Time on his cash cow. Many of my favourite films are pure - and poor - old fashioned corn but no one on planet Earth thinks they're life changing works of Art in the same way as they do this monument to Luck.The film I saw was Part I full stop; if Disney ever gets to Part XXVII what if they want to do a prequel to the prequel and more pathetic re-numbering and retrospective digital title re-jigging ensues, will Lucas let them? I've always favoured the originals of anything generally and also draw the line at altering future history.I enjoy it immensely whenever it's on UK TV, as I can feel the persuasive Force of not having to think for a couple of hours and to simply enjoy the ride.","

This movie is great at setting up a large cast of characters and an immense world to explore, but something about this movie (after two watches) just doesn't get me rearing to keep watching Star Wars. Perhaps it's the 2-hour length, or the fact they made this film with the expectation there wouldn't be others, but after awhile I just get bored!

"tom-darwin","22 April 2006","The very first note of John Williams's horn-blaring score as the film's title in thousand-foot-high block letters flashes on screen is the very moment when American film-making turned inexorably to big-budget, grand-themed audiovisual extravaganza strung together with simple stories, snappy catchphrases & cutesy jokes. But if George Lucas decided to follow Henry Ford rather than John Ford, he built a Shelby Cobra & left Pinto-making to his many, many imitators. Ironically, he himself remade one of the finest works of film master Akira Kurosawa, the Western-themed ""Hidden Fortress,"" with one scene (the fight in the bar) lifted from ""Yojimbo."" As a result, ""Star Wars"" has a bit of the jittery discomfort of characters trying to fit into a story that wasn't quite made for them, like people with past life experiences that intrude into the present. Kurosawa's hero is split not into two but THREE heroes in ""Star Wars"" (four if you include the princess, who has a more prominent role in ""Star Wars""). Hamill's Luke is often overshadowed by Kenobi (Guinness, whose skill had aged better than any fine wine) and Solo (Ford, in the role that deservedly made him a star), though he often holds his own as the clueless but determined farmboy-turned-hero. In less than five minutes, ""Star Wars"" sets the standard of outer-space audiovisual special effects that the industry was bound to follow from then on, forever sweeping away the earnest, toylike realism that Gerry Anderson was then giving us in ""Space: 1999"" in favor of exhausting but beautiful orgies of fast, violent, sweeping movement culminating in explosions of bright color & blaring sound. No wonder there's never any sex. ""Star Wars"" is science fiction only because it's set in outer space, by which standard ""Dirty Harry"" is a detective story & ""Last Tango in Paris"" a romance. Little attempt is made to explain the technological wonders depicted (we never find out why light sabers never have to be recharged or get even a cursory explanation of the Death Star). What little science there is can't be counted on, as when Solo extols the drag-racing abilities of the Millennium Falcon in parsecs, which are units of distance, not elapsed time. But Lucas never means to educate, only to entertain. Solo is a smuggler, not a science officer, while the others are not doctors or engineers but warriors, royalty or villains. Lucas's hammerhanded excess works because it never lets up & never goes for the cheap & easy. Though the heroes are unconvincing, ""Star Wars"" creates an array of badguys in the Galactic Empire that remain unsurpassed in cinema, headed by Darth Vader, who makes the Wicked Witch of the West look like Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle. In another irony, the most memorable scene in ""Star Wars"" is the motionless roundtable conference chaired by Tarkin (Cushing, in the greatest role of his long career) which yielded phrases long & gleefully repeated by a delighted America (""This station is now the ultimate power in the universe!"" ""This bickering is pointless!"" ""I find your lack of faith disturbing""). Perhaps, with the space program petering out & the hard realities of nuclear energy coming home to us, our fascination with scientific exploration was wearing thin. In the 1960s it enabled the cast of ""Star Trek"" to bring the writings of sci-fi geniuses to life with cardboard & aluminum foil. Never again. What better honor, or infamy if you like, could there be to ""Star Wars"" than that the ""Star Trek"" movies of the 1980s followed the simple themes, cuteness & spectacular effects of ""Star Wars,"" turning their backs on their own heritage of awed exploration? Perhaps that first detractors and then supporters of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative nicknamed it ""Star Wars"" so convincingly that the original name was quickly forgotten. The film might be a bit dated with its holistic, New Age mysticism (feel the force FLOWING through you!) which likely owes more to Jack Kerouac than Musashi Miyamoto & which became more difficult to depict with a straight face the farther the sequels & prequels went. Nevertheless, it was a worthy successor to the Code of the West, especially in contrasting Darth Vader with Luke & Kenobi. ""Star Wars"" can't really be judged by the standards of other films, partly because it reset the standards & partly because it became, most unusually, the fourth in a series of six! But there's no doubt that it's a heroic sensory extravaganza that will leave the viewer at once exhausted & exhilarated--and will do it over & over again, without offending, condescending or making one think too hard. If you just want to escape to a galaxy far, far away, jettison all skepticism, lower your shields & prepare to make the jump to hyperspace.","

"cartesianthought","22 December 2015","At it's time of release, it was really progressive and an influential classic, but it's quite average when judging it by its enduring quality. For what it's worth it's entertaining, the costumes are well done and it's good fantasy. Technology ages fast. The script is average, the acting isn't particularly well done and the characters aren't deep, the story is simple and there aren't a lot of human emotions on this one. It did successfully introduce the franchise so that the later and better entries could build on it. But I'm calling it over-hyped on this one (sorry). Maybe I just had to see it when I was 11 years old (or have grown up in the 70's) to see what Star Wars fans adore about this one.","

"TOMASBBloodhound","11 April 2004","If there is one thing about my childhood I can be thankful for, it's the fact that I was a boy between 1977 and 1983. I got to grow up with three of the most inspirational fantasy films ever made. It all started with Star Wars Episode IV in 1977. We all know the story about this battle between the forces of good represented by a fragmented rebel alliance and the forces of evil represented by an intergalactic EMPIRE. And yes, my sister and I had all of the toys, clothes, sleeping bags, trading cards, etc...
Let's just focus this review on the last twenty or so minutes of the film. Perhaps the greatest and most inspiring scenes in film history. I'm talking about the rebel assault on the approaching Death Star.Who couldn't be moved by a dozen or so tiny ships flying out to face this massive battle station positioning itself to wipe out their entire army tucked away on a little moon. How about the shot of these ships locking their wings in attack position with the giant Death Star looming in front of them?Some really neat camera shots as the battle begins. The rebels seem to be wreaking some havoc in their concentrated attack, until Darth Vader and some Imperial fighters join the battle. The rebel fighters are searching for a tiny ventilation shaft to drop some ""proton torpedoes"" into. It seems this is the only vulnerable point on this massive space station. One of the fighters actually gets a good shot at it...We get a shot from inside the Death Star. Moff Tarkin (played superbly by veteran horror film actor Peter Cushing) is approached by one of his underlings.""Sir, we've analyzed their attack pattern and there IS a danger. Should we have your shuttle standing by?""Tarkin's over-confident reply:""Evacuate? In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances!""The battle rages on. Most of the rebel ships are blown to bits. It looks like Luke Skywalker will be one of them also until...""You're all clear kid, now let's blow this thing and go home!""Luke, without the aid of his targeting computer, takes one last shot. The Death Star has the moon with the rebel base in sight...Luke lets out a sigh of relief as his torpedoes drop down the shaft...Tarkin gives the order to fire:""You may fire when ready.""We get a shot of about four remaining rebel ships turning towards home.We hear a technician inside the Death Star:""Stand by...""BOOM!!!!!!!!!!We see the gleeful medal ceremony back at the rebel base.
Thank You George Lucas!!!!I'd give it a million of ten stars if I could.So sayeth the Hound.","

"DarthBill","9 June 2004","The one that started it all...Spunky Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is captured by the evil, satanic bastard known as Darth Vader (body of British weight lifting champion David Prowse, also the same man who trained Christopher Reeve for 1978's ""Superman - the Movie""; voice of James Earl Jones) and exposed as a traitor to the evil empire that has enslaved the galaxy and is challenged by a heroic Rebellion. Two of Leia's robots, the hapless C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels) and the handy R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) escape the ship and crash land on the desert wasteland planet known as Tatioone. After being captured by Jawas (Hobbit like people who wear cloaks) and traded to a farmer known as Owen Lars, his wife Beru and their nephew Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill, the future voice of the Joker). Luke is a callow youth who would like nothing more than to leave Tatioone and find adventure in the universe, then he stumbles upon a message in R2 from Leia asking for the help of an Obi-Wan Kenobi, AKA: Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness). Luke doesn't know anyone named Obi-Wan Kenobi but he knows a strange old hermit man named Ben Kenobi but is unaware that Obi-Wan & Ben are the same man. When R2 sneaks off in the night, Luke and 3P0 chase him down in the day and are attacked by Sand People AKA: Tusken Raiders. When the Sand People try to raid Luke's hover-car, they are scared off by Ben Kenobi, who reveals himself to Luke to be Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke tells him that R2 claims to be his property and has a message for him. Obi-Wan checks out the message and we find out that he was once a great Jedi Knight and that he was a friend of Luke's father, the late Anakin Skywalker, who was also a great Jedi Knight but one who, as far as Luke knows died of mysterious circumstances; actually, according to Obi-Wan, Anakin was murdered by O's former pupil, ""a young Jedi named Darth Vader."" Luke, however, has yet to discover the horrible truth behind it all... well, Luke is later persuaded to help Obi-Wan and study the way of the Force, which is what gives a Jedi his power (it helps that the Imperial Storm Troopers mutilated his aunt and uncle while he was out). Luke, Obi-Wan and the robots head off to Mos Eisly space port where they join forces with rogue pilot Han Solo (Harrison Ford in the role that made him a star) and his wookie companion Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Though they're supposed to go the planet of Alderaan, they are intercepted by the Death Star, a giant space station orb that blows planets up real good and was responsible for the destroying Alderaan before our heroes could get there. Once on board the Death Star, our heroes rescue Princess Leia and get into all sorts of hijinx that will change their lives forever. Obi-Wan is tragically killed in a duel with his former student, Darth Vader. In the rousing finale, Luke, Han and Chewbacca become big time heroes for destroying the Death Star. The adventure, however, is only beginning.Well acted, great special effects in both the original theatrical version and the over done special edition, the classic ""Star Wars"" trilogy is a masterpiece that, for better or worse, helped usher in the age of the blockbuster. Well acted all around by Mark, Harry (as in Harrison Ford), Carrie, Alec and Peter Cushing (as the other villain), but Ford steals the show as Han Solo, the great Rapscallion of the Universe.""You're all clear kid now let's blow this thing and go home!"" - Han Solo","

"pmtelefon","2 December 2020","I've seen ""Star Wars: Episode IV-A New Hope"" in the theater three times. The first was when the original came out (North/South Theater, Hicksville, NY). (I waited outside on line for over two hours.) The second time was for the Special Edition (Fresh Meadows, NY). The third time was when it was re-released in 3D (Fresh Meadows, NY). It was great all three times. I've also seen it a bunch of times on video. ""Star Wars"" is a true classic. I still remember how the audience reacted back in 1977. There are times I still get that rush I got way back when. Writer/director Tom Laughlin, of ""Billy Jack"" fame may have been kind of nutty but he was right about one thing. He dropped out of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences after ""Star Wars"" failed to win the Oscar for Best Picture. He knew that with ""Star Wars"" writer/director George Lucas had changed the way movies were going to be made in the future. Laughlin was right. ""Star Wars"" is a landmark piece of filmmaking.","

"Bored_Dragon","9 December 2018","Episodes I and II have 6,5 on IMDb, III has 7,7 and this one has almost 9. I don't understand. Maybe I am not able to see things from the '70s perspective, I was not even born back then, but from my point of view, all four I saw so far are on more or less same level, slightly above average movies. I'm giving 7 to all of them. I just have to acknowledge one thing as first time viewer. If I didn't know anything about this franchise before watching it, it is possible that I wouldn't even notice two-decade space between trilogies. Sure, when you see 3 movies from the 21st century and then in the 4th sequel you see Harrison Ford as a youngster, it reveals pretty much, but other than that trilogies are perfectly blended.7/10","

"Lady_Targaryen","1 February 2006","''Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope'' is the first movie from the old trilogy. I will always prefer the old Star Wars' trilogy than the modern one, and watching again this movie makes me feel very good! It is a period of civil war,since an evil Empire controlled by Darth Vader and the Emperor has the control of all the galaxies. Rebel bases finally had their first victory against the horrible Galactic Empire, and princess Leia, who is part of the Rebel Alliance is made a prisoner by Darth Vader, since she refuses to say where are the plans of the lethal weapon called 'Death Star'', who were stolen by the rebel spies. The Death Star is a big space station,capable of destroying an entire planet if it's owner desires. Darth Vader also wants to know where is the secret base of the Rebels to destroy it. Since Princess Leia is a clever girl, she placed the plans of the Death Star in R2-D2, and send him to a special mission with C3PO in Tattoine, where he needs to finds where Obi Wan Kenobi is.R2 and C3PO arrives in Tattoine with success, but after a time they are kidnapped by the Sand People, who wants to sell them; for their luck, their buyer is Luke Skywalker and his uncle Owen. At the same time that Lukes discovers that R2 needs to show the message for Obi wan, Vader's army went to Tattoinee to find R2 to recover their stolen plans. R2 goes after Obi Wan, and C3PO and Luke go after him. After being attacked by the Sand People and saved by Obi Wan, Luke tells him about the message in C3PO. All this time, Obi wan was hidden in Tattoine as a hermit with the name of 'Ben Kenobi'. Obi Wan then tells Luke many things about his past as a Jedi, and the fact that he was a friend of Luke's dad, Anakin. He also gives Luke a light saber that once belonged to Anakin. The Lars knows about the truth behind Luke's past, that's why specially uncle Owen never let him leave Tattoine. Worried that the Imperial troops are searching for R2 and C3PO, Luke runs in his home's direction, but he discovers too late that his uncle and aunt were killed by then. Sad and without any attachments in Tattoine, Luke decides to go with Obi Wan to Alderaan to help Leia.They two meet Chewbacca and Han Solo, who can take then to Alderaan. Once the money payments is sealed, they enter in the ''Millenniun Falcon'',Han's ship ,and they go to Alderaan's direction. The problem is: Alderaan is not there anymore. The ''Death Star'' destroyed Leia's native planet,since she refused to say where the rebel base stays.Once Luke,Han and Obi Wan comes to save Leia and they succeed in their mission,they know will have other problem: destroy the Death Star.Ps: I think that Obi Wan's death is too weak!Ps2: How does Luke understand what R2 says to him?","

"jscontoyannis","25 May 2005","Truly a landmark film. When it came out, there had never been anything like it before, and it truly caused quite a stir. I would contend that it is not as good as its sequel, Empire Strikes Back; but it is still a great movie. There is humor, action, and some heartfelt moments. It is also our introduction to some great characters that people will never forget - Chewbacca, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi...and of course everyone's favorite villain, Darth Vader. Alec Guinness really is outstanding in this movie. His role as Luke's first mentor is understated and believable...his somewhat tired attitude in retrospect seems very understandable after watching the prequels - after all he's been through, it is very believable when he tells Luke, ""I'm getting to old for this sort of thing."" The visual effects are not only groundbreaking, but they still hold up very well even in this CGI-effects laden era. I would contend that ILM's use of modeling and lighting in the old films actually lends a more believable look to the action scenes than the prequels' use of video-game style battles and sensory overload. There is great chemistry between the actor's - and while Luke is a bit annoying, the back and forth of Han and Chewbacca, and C-3PO and R2-D2, as well as Leia's chemistry with Han and Luke, make this movie extremely entertaining on an emotional level - it also makes you care about the characters. Let us compare the lightsaber duel of this movie with that from Phantom Menace. Although the acrobatics and sheer fury of the duel just are not there in A New Hope, we actually feel something when Obi-Wan allows Vader to strike him down. Conversely, when Qui-Gon Jinn is slain, there is not the same (if any) feeling after it is done. Well, I'm rambling now. But this movie has it all. Space battles, lightsaber duels (a la Samurai flicks), chase sequences, thinly veiled references to the Western genre in the Canteen on Tatooine. A Truly great adventure that, as it ended, was really just beginning.","

"taylorkingston","26 January 2018","I loved this movie. I started watching it about five years ago and I just couldn't. The quality, the effects, the cheesy lines. I just couldn't. Then two years ago, when I was fifteen, I gave it another go. And I loved it. Star Wars is now one of my favourite movie franchises. The quality still isn't great. The effects are still sometimes obvious. And it's still cheesy, but I still love it. I've actually been obsessed with it lately, cramming a lifetime's worth of love into two years. It's not my favourite out of the original trilogy, or out of the entire series, but it is second favourite out of the original trilogy, and anything beats the prequels. Even the dance scene with the Ewoks at the end of Return Of The Jedi.Okay, where to start? This is one of the most well-known movies in history. Most people know all about it. But my take is this: Luke Skywalker is a little lame, but also loveable. His crush on Leia is now creepy knowing they're twins. R2-D2 and C-3PO have very funny chemistry. Darth Vader is bada*s. Han Solo is freaking amazing. The Emperor is creepy. The Death Star is creepy. And way too easily destroyed. Chewie is adorable while still being tough. Jabba The Hut should not be CGI. Han shot first. RIP Alderaan. The Millenium Falcoln is super cool. And Greedo should have subtitles even if the subtitles aren't already one. Sorry, some bits are just from George Lucas' edits in the different releases of the movie. But still.One of my favourite quotes: ""Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid."" - Han SoloOverall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome.","

"paigeanneknght","14 December 2022","I am a 25 year old who had never seen a full Star Wars movie in her life. I decided to start at the beginning only 43 years late. This review is as someone who's never seen the full movies.Where to begin. I had seen so many parodies and clips and gifs from these movies, seeing it in real life in its entirety almost didn't seem real. In the context of the movie so many things were made so much better. I've heard all the quotes before, but seeing the scenes that they came from blowing my mind. It felt like every scene was an Easter egg.Some of the CGI was a bit spotty, but for a film made in 1977 I can quite honestly say a lot of the CGI was better than some stuff we have today. The space explosions especially where my favorite to watch. Plus the practical effects are incredible, and I loved how much creativity they put into the hundreds of types alien monsters. I love how quickly they bring you into the world and explain almost nothing. It really is a show don't tell kind of franchise. They don't feel a need to shove exposition down your throats oh, but you still enjoy and understand everything that's happening. Storytelling technique that is dead in a majority of modern film.The biggest surprise I had, was not seeing plot points and characters that I knew existed in the universe. I found myself asking: ""wait where's Yoda? Is Liam Neeson in this one? Is jar jar Binks in this one? That's Jabba, when does he take princess Leia as slave? Isn't Darth Vader going to have that famous scene with Luke?"" I kept waiting for scenes that I thought would happen but didn't. It is cool however to see all of the setup they do for future sequels. It makes me wish I had never seen Spaceballs for the family Guy Star wars or any references at all.Overall, I knew I would love this movie before I even put it on, and I enjoyed every second of it. I can't wait to watch the rest of this series and review all of the other movies.","

"nickenchuggets","29 June 2021","Throughout the history of movies, maybe no other series has had a bigger impact on popular culture than Star Wars. The entire franchise is talked about more and praised more than I can even start to discuss. Before our current predicament (depending on how you look at it) with the franchise and George's decisions to ""remaster"" the movies and essentially downgrade them, there was the original film made back in the 70s. I'm not going to talk about any of the expanded universe things that Star Wars has in its lore because I just want to focus on this first movie for now. As expected, many people consider this one the best of all, although some might argue episode V is slightly better. I'm not going to debate any of that, but I will say that before this movie was released, things of its caliber were hardly dreamed of. Star Wars has such an unimaginable wealth of content to explore and talk about that it is almost as deep as our real universe, and it expands with each new movie that comes out. Of course, with such a huge amount of subjects to delve into, George Lucas had to start somewhere, and he chose to do something not many other movie makers would do. Star wars does obviously have a starting point, but not where you would expect it to be. The movie begins with a spaceship that belongs to a so called ""rebel alliance"" being closely pursued by a large class of spacegoing warship known as a star destroyer. Bristling with laser cannons and tractor beams, the star destroyer is able to give most rebel ships a run for their money. In this case, the rebel ship (called the Tantive IV) is trying to outrun the much more formidable Imperial one, presumably because it has important cargo. However, the rebel ship takes considerable damage and comes to a halt. The Rebel ship is pulled underneath the Imperial one, allowing the enemy to board it. Led by the ruthless Darth Vader, Rebel soldiers onboard are effortlessly swept aside. Meanwhile, Princess Leia Organa (one of the Rebel leaders) hides the aforementioned important secret cargo inside a droid named R2-D2. The cargo is very crucial to the story because it is the schematics to the Death Star, a gargantuan Imperial space station armed with a laser strong enough to annihilate an entire planet. After taking Leia hostage, Vader frantically tries to search the Rebel ship for the schematics, but R2 uses an escape pod to blast onto the desert planet of Tatooine with a protocol droid named C-3PO. The plans are out of Imperial hands (for now.) On the desert planet, R2 and C-3PO are captured by roaming travelers called Jawas who wear brown robes and have two yellow dots for eyes with no visible faces. The jawas offer to sell the droids to Owen Lars. Luke Skywalker, his nephew, lives with him. After the droids are in their possession, Luke comes across a holographic recording of Leia that says someone named ""Obi-Wan"" must help her. Luke later runs into Obi-Wan in the desert, who now lives in exile and is known as Ben Kenobi. Ben used to be a very powerful warrior who is able to use a magical presence called ""the Force"" to manipulate people and his surroundings. Not everyone can use it, and it takes a very long time to get good at. He tells Luke the warrior group he was a part of is called the Jedi Order, and Jedi use a special type of close-quarters weapon that is basically a beam of light projected from a metal hilt. These ""lightsabers"" are incredibly powerful and valuable weapons, and Luke obtains one from Obi-Wan. It apparently belonged to Luke's father, who was killed by Vader a long time ago. Later on, Luke and Obi-Wan must go to a cantina in the town of Mos Eisley to search for a spaceship that will enable them to take the death star plans to Leia's home planet. They come across Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his co-pilot Chewbacca. Together, they fly the Millennium Falcon; a fairly outmoded and obsolete spacecraft that isn't meant for fighting but can be useful in skilled hands. After taking off in the ship, they set out for Leia's homeworld, Alderaan, but not before Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) uses the Death Star's enormous superlaser to blow the planet to bits. Onboard the Falcon, the crew is now having second thoughts about going to Alderaan, and notice it isn't even there. They fly towards some object that resembles a moon, but upon getting closer, it's revealed to be the death star. The ship is powerless to fly away and the Death Star pulls them towards it with a tractor beam. Luke, Solo, and the others disguise themselves as Vader's soldiers (stormtroopers) and search the enormous Death Star for Princess Leia. Upon finding her, they attempt to escape, but find out that Kenobi has come face to face with Vader. His lightsaber battle with him buys the rest of the Rebels time to escape, but Vader kills Kenobi after he willingly deactivates his lightsaber. Regardless, the plans for the Death Star are secure which allows the Rebels to launch a huge assault on the space station with starfighters, one of them being piloted by Luke. The Death Star plans illustrate that the only way to destroy it is to use a proton torpedo to destroy its main reactor, causing a fatal chain reaction. In an attempt to stop Luke from achieving his goal, Vader chases him in his own starfighter, flanked by two TIE fighters. Luke only needs to hold out for a few more seconds to launch the torpedo, but Vader closes in on him fast. Right when all seems lost, Solo appears from out of nowhere in the Millennium Falcon and blasts Vader's ship off Luke's tail. Vader survives, but Luke is cleared to fire. The torpedo goes right down the reactor port and initiates the chain reaction process, which culminates in the entire Death Star exploding. The Rebel base on the nearby planet is spared a horrible demise, and the Rebels are saved. I don't think I need to say this, but I will anyway. This movie is awesome. The visuals, sound effects, special effects, sheer size of the locations, etc. Is still going to amaze people almost 50 years later, and I think everyone can agree the sound of a lightsaber is what makes Star Wars Star Wars. It deserves recognition both for what it is and for what it started. Even in this one movie alone, there is a huge amount of content and lore, but not much backstory. The first Star Wars movie begins in the middle of a galactic war, which makes the audience feel there's a lot of backstory that you didn't get to see. Thanks to the newer movies, we now know the things that came many years before (and after) the events of this one. It might seem obvious, but the characters are all great too. Luke is the classic hero archetype who has a great deal of responsibility on his shoulders, and with the threat of the Death Star looming, it makes the tension feel more dramatic. Although he doesn't appear much, Tarkin is one of the most disturbing characters because of his ability to kill millions at the push of a button and feel no remorse. Han Solo is not a hero in the traditional sense, but he cares about his crewmembers and would do anything to ensure their safety. Leia, while basically a damsel in distress for much of the movie, still displays a huge amount of defiance in the face of Vader's evil empire. Obi-Wan serves as the physically old master of the ways of the Force, and despite his aged appearance, he is very skilled and mentally powerful. Vader is probably the hardest to categorize because he is obviously the main bad guy, but the audience will still most likely pity him because of his dark past and insecurities. Obi-Wan says he used to be allies with him, but Vader became too interested in the dark side of the Force and lost his way. To summarize, I shouldn't have to state the obvious, but you really should watch this movie at least once. It is a mind-bendingly good start to one of the best movie series in history.","

Sure it's revolutionary at the time it came out for the first time, but really if you watch it right now there is actually quite a lot of flaws in the movie, from the goofy and silliness, an unsatisfied and weird death, but an amazing visual design, creature, set, John Williams incredible score, the fun that all the actor do, and so do the audience watching it and at least for me mostly, it's still a pretty good movie overall.","

"sethn172","20 February 2006","All I can say is that ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"" is the best, in my opinion, of all six ""Star Wars"" films.I've seen this movie in just about every viewing method possible (both versions), and no matter how I view it, this movie is always the same. Combining the retroness of the 1970s with that of the future, ""Star Wars"" is in a different breed of sci-fi entertainment - nothing cheesy like the old 1950s monster or space drive-in movies, and nothing too arty and ordinary like the space movies of recent fare. Lucas and his team have done an excellent job with ""Star Wars."" Oh sure, the recent movies may not be up to par like the original ones do, but still, this is a movie series that will forever be stuck in every human's life.""Star Wars"" is one movie that should never be missed. If you've never seen ""Star Wars"" in your life, then you need a reality check!","

"TheUnknown837-1","14 April 2007","It is a shame that not any other of George Lucas's films were as fun and inspiring as his unforgettable epic ""Star Wars: A New Hope"". It was a film that has since been spoofed and ripped-off in many forms of media. It has five sequels, and has many branch-off television series. And it is undeniably one of the most financially successful and definitely one of the better science-fiction films of this or any other age.""Star Wars"" has one of the most brilliantly constructed and detailed alternative reality settings ever. Literally everything in it makes the ""galaxy"" seem like a real place. Not only is there civilizations of humans, but civilizations of other creatures, and there are livestock and other creatures like in our world. Names such as droids, banthas, and wookiees work out. But I do feel that the ""sandpeople"" could've had a more compelling name. The concept of blasters and lightsabers were pure genius and the effects used on these weapons were state-of-the-art for their time. The props and CGI used for the other creatures, such as Chewbacca, may not be acceptable if ""Star Wars"" came out today, but were great for back then. Costume design was magnificent, especially the great details put into the villainous character of Darth Vader, who is perhaps the most memorable movie villain ever. Although he wouldn't really make his terror so profound and complete until the first sequel ""The Empire Strikes Back."" The concept of the Death Star is also a fine one.But while ""Star Wars"" most certainly looks great in terms of detail and special effects, and even moreso on the entertainment level, there are some details that I have a really hard time accepting. Mostly, it's concerned with the screenplay. George Lucas is truly a great screenwriter when it comes to developing story, but when it comes to dialogue, he's not the best there is. Some of the dialogue in the film, mostly the lines spoken by Princess Leia, make me wince. For example her quote ""I should have known it was you holding Vader's lease. I smelled your foul stench when I was brought onboard."" What sensible person would even think of saying a line that dumb? I also personally felt that Luke Skywalker asked WAY too many questions and too many times. In the Tatooine part of the movie, he asks ""Do you know what he's talking about?"" numerous times, more than necessary. And all of the lines featuring the word ""sandpeople"" just seemed weakening to the script. The ""sandpeople"" were suppose to sound frightening, but they just sound pathetic.Basically, the one and only thing that I have wrong with ""Star Wars"" is its dialogue sequences. And that is because George Lucas's weakness at writing is dialogue, which he freely admits to. But that does not make ""Star Wars"" a bad movie. Perhaps I was disappointed with it, but it's still a great movie to watch.","

"AppleBlossom","25 March 2005","George Lucus stunned audiences with this outer space saga when it was released and deservingly so. It was a film quite like nothing anyone had seen before a truly visual and cinematic achievement. The story begins on Chapter IV and takes us on an action packed journey filled with aliens, intrigue and adventure. The success of Star Wars is ultimately due to the wonderful imagination of its director and of course to the extremely well orchestrated cast. I think George Lucas was riding high with his previous film success 'American Graffiti, but this is far removed from Star Wars, no similarities at all. I was simply captivated the first time I saw this film in the cinema's back in '77 and still amalthough the big screen does give it more of an impact. Everything about Star Wars will definitely appeal to a vast audience from children to adults alike.it's a 'must see film' in my opinion. Then when you're finished watching Star Wars, just think; you have only 5 more chapters to go. 10/10","

"michaelgarykelley1994","16 December 2013","Well, the only way to begin this review is to mention when I saw ""Star Wars"" for the very first time. I was merely a baby, from what I recall my parents telling me before their divorce. I wasn't even born when this first feature film hit theatres. I'm nineteen now, but I must admit that ""Star Wars"" was one of the many things that decorated my childhood. I always adored it, and always looked-up to Luke Skywalker. It was the type of view I can only assume all boys had; we all wanted to be a Luke Skywalker. We wanted to be the cool hero with a lightsaber. In this review, I will do my very best not to give you a biased review. However, forgive me, for I have always been a ""Star Wars"" fanatic. This was my first re-viewing in quite a while, so at least I'm reviewing the film with a clear set of eyes.When two droids, C3-PO and R2-D2, escape the clutches of a shoot-out on a spaceship, they land on a desert-covered landscape, only to find themselves captured as slaves. They are reunited among the slavetraders, called Jawas. The Empire realizes that Princess Leia Organa had sent a message along with one of the droids who managed to escape the attack, so they begin to hunt for R2-D2 and C3-PO. Little does the Empire know that a young man, Luke Skywalker, and his uncle, Owen, had just purchased the two droids from the Jawas. While cleaning the two droids up, Luke stumbles upon the message Princess Leia had left for an ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"". Luke considers ""Obi-Wan"" a possible relative of a man named Ben Kenobi and goes on the look for him. For now, I will end my synopsis for the fact that I just described the first half-hour of the film. I want there to be more for you. All you need to know is that Luke is taken on a journey that changes his entire life and purpose, helping him make a transfer from a teen who longs to leave the ranch he is stuck living on to a man seeking the fall of the Empire. This film isn't just a film; it is a true adventure.When it comes to the acting in ""Star Wars"", I truly don't believe it could get any better whatsoever. Mark Hamill was born to play Luke, Harrison Ford dominated his role as the swift Han Solo (a bounty hunter Luke ends up traveling with), Carrie Fisher is courageously independent as Princess Leia and doesn't fall into the shadows of her co-stars, but Alec Guinness was exceptional as Ben (or Obi-Wan) Kenobi. There is something magical and hopeful about the way Alec portrays Obi-Wan in this film. Also, Anthony Daniels is perfect as C3-PO! He may have been the simple comic relief, but I promise you he was the perfect choice for this character. I truly cannot see anyone ever playing this golden-plated character, who has practically become the symbol for any outsider who may have not seen the films. Without a doubt, the acting was exceptional in all respects. I believe the trickiest had to have been David Prowse, seeing as how Lucas ended-up not using Prowse's real voice for Darth Vader. With that thought, I must say that I enjoy James Earl Jones' voice much more for the character.Anyways, moving along! The writing of each character was phenomenal. I feel that the banter was so well-done that it brings these characters to life even more, seeing the situations each of them are in within the duration of the film. ""Star Wars"" was also plotted very well, with all events and scenes not feeling out of place once.The special effects, I must say, are top-notch, even if they have aged a bit in 2013 viewer's eyes. At some points, the effects look fantastic, while other scenes look like a ""Star Wars"" fan film from YouTube. That's common with classic cinema, so I don't mind it. I sincerely believe that people aren't the only ones to age.This ""Star Wars"" film is definitely not my favorite, but it runs right behind ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"", on my list. Overall, it is still very enjoyable with set designs that look like legitimate places amongst the galaxy. The detailing of the sets in this film are just shockingly realistic.""Star Wars"" deserves the eight stars that I have rated it. I like it, hold it as a memory in my heart, but find it to be an action-fantasy film, for the most part. It is brilliant, it is intelligent, and it is worth a try. I highly recommend the film.May the force be with you all! God bless, and Merry Christmas!","

"Ruskington","1 June 2020","While sci-fi is not not my preferred film genre, I cannot deny the sheer majesty and magnitude of the first and best Star Wars movie. A visually stunning and highly creative piece of artwork with one of the all-time great scores by John Williams. Some of the characters are brilliantly devised (not least the droids) and the landscapes and spacecraft are generally incredible. I cannot even imagine how astounding this would have been to innocent eyes back in 1977.Having said that, I have never particularly enjoyed George Lucas' writing very much and find the usual banality and lazy plot structure is well in place here. Much of the dialogue is incredibly corny and the storyline itself is quite childish and predictable. The pathetic inability of the Stormtroopers to hit a SINGLE bloody target is infuriating and ridiculous. It makes the battle scenes almost completely pointless given how much divine intervention the main characters seem to be afforded. This type of lazy plot armouring has always been my main gripe with action films and Star Wars is as bad as any.In spite of this, it is hard to be too critical of such a groundbreaking piece of cinema. I certainly don't understand how it has developed such a monumentally huge reputation but I wouldn't begrudge anyone rating it as their favourite film.","

"rneil95","5 February 2012","Since its release way back in 1977, George Lucas' epic masterpiece ""Star Wars"" has gone on to become quite possibly the most popular franchise in motion picture history, with one of the biggest fan followings imaginable. But no matter how much money this franchise makes, or how many people see it, no matter how many sequels or prequels or re-releases or remasters it endures, the original classic still remains to be a very personal film. Despite the success it has undergone since its release, the production of ""Star Wars"" was a highly troubled one, many people expecting it to not even get completed at all. The hard work and dedication that Lucas and his cast and crew went through to get this thing made definitely shows through, and that makes the movie all the more endearing to watch. Quite simply, it's an incredible achievement in movie-making.Now, these films have been discussed to death, but I feel like I'd like to give my own two cents on the subject, and my thoughts could easily be summed up in five words: ""Star Wars"" is absolutely amazing. Everything about it, from the acting, the effects, the story, the mythos, the music, the incredible intrigue that has keep this series alive for so long, it all started here, and it's great. I don't feel like I need to go too in-depth with a plot summary, because this is one of the most iconic films in history, but basically, ""Star Wars"" follows a simple farm boy living on a desert planet named Luke Skywalker, who yearns to fight with the Rebel Alliance against the evil Galactic Empire. Before he knows it, he's thrust into an intergalactic adventure, along with an inventive cast of characters, as he tries to help rescue a princess and destroy the Empire's newest weapon: a space station with the power to destroy planets, called the Death Star.As I said, this movie is awesome. The acting is fantastic all around, each one giving a perfect performance in these incredibly iconic, and unforgettable roles. The inventive special effects are some of the best of their time, and the action sequences are gripping and fantastic, never allowing a dull moment to come through. The story is incredibly fascinating, managing to blend science fiction through the space travel, droids, and aliens, with fantasy through the mystical Force, a defining trait of the Jedi Knights. The intrigue levels are really high here, and it's that intriguing quality that allows viewers to really get invested and really talk in depth about this movie.This film defined a generation. To this day, people still talk about it, and I doubt that it will ever stop being discussed. ""Star Wars"" is one of the best sci-fi fantasy epics ever made, and will always be a binding Force of cinema for the rest of time.","

"witster18","23 February 2015","One of my co-workers, who's about my same age(40ish), was talking about an argument he was having with his 17yr-old son. The argument was whether or not the new ""Marvel"" films were bigger and better, and whether or not the whole ""buzz' around them was bigger and better than the original Star Wars trilogy.I don't think the younger generation will ever fully understand the scale of the first trilogy. They MAY get a better understanding after JJ Abrams returns the trilogy to it's awesome roots.The first Star Wars film, known simply as Star Wars, was a land- breaking milestone of film-making, with a story, characters, and effects(not all effects are cgi people) that melded together into the greatest interplanetary adventure of all-time(at least until the sequel came out).Today's generation can pick between Spiderman, Ironman, Captain America, and the Guardians of the Galaxy to find the film that they love the most, but when I was a kid there was one film, or should I say one trilogy, that stood far, FAR above the rest. The number one argument that is made today by the younger generation is that the effects are outdated etc, but it was in fact Lucas' commitment(at least early on) to use models and make-up to create a world like no other. SOmething that CGI just can't capture. When I saw Guardians in the theater I thought it was amazing, but later I saw it on the 4K 60"" TV, and like many flicks, it kinda accentuated the small flaws of the cgi and the set-pieces, whereas I watch Star Wars and it actually shows how amazing the film was in that aspect.CGI isn't necessarily an improvement. It's films like Star Wars and Blade Runner, whose ""Gritty"" qualities actually add realism to an unreal world. The only problems I have with the first three Star Wars films are the ""digitally enhanced versions"" that Lucas added later. That's why I eagerly await the original untouched films' release on Blue-Ray.Scores usually drop a bit over time, and as it stands now, the weakest of the original trilogy is scored 8.4(Return of the Jedi), and that is higher than Avengers, Guardians, Cap 2, and Ironman, and FOR GOOD REASON.And the original Star Wars is a superior film in every way as well. No Hokey opening like ""Avengers"", no lack of storyline like Guardians, no under-menacing not required to act Villain like Cap 2, and while I can't nitpick anything about Ironman, overall it just doesn't stand- up against Star Wars, it's a beatdown.Simply put, it's EVERYTHING about it that makes it better. The acting, the story, the character development, the scale of the production, the start, the finish, the middle and every minute in- between.Part of the problem here is that the added material in the re- released versions really detracts from the original films flow. The stupid dancing crap in Jedi, the Walking Jabba in Star Wars, etc... it did nothing but hurt the original films. The only added footage that didn't detract from the original films was some of the added bells and whistles to ""Cloud City"" in Empire, and Biggs early appearance in empire, which was wasn't an 'enhancement', it was cut-footage from the original tapes, other than that, the added stuff only hurt the overall quality of the original films. He basically added stuff that was the kind of stuff that ruined the second trilogy, so the original untouched films are still the real gem here. And that's not what these kids are watching either, because the untouched versions are HARD TO FIND!DOn't even exist on DVD or blu-ray. One of the times I'm glad I still have my VHS. Uh-Oh, Gotta-go, Re-tro:)And WHile I love the new marvel films, they don't have what Star Wars and it's two sequels(i'm a purist) have.. that tangible something you CAN put your finger on - because it's REAL.. they built those ships, they designed and made those costumes and set-pieces. That kind of attention to detail, and scale just isn't in the Marvel films. Sure, it's cool to see Hulk crumbling down a building, but this galaxy really doesn't ""SEEM"" so far away in Star Wars. It has that 'realistic' edge to it. It's the reason that you couldn't make a legit remake of Ben- Hur, Ten Commandments, or other older ""epic"" films... it would literally cost Billions.Even some of my favorite Sci-Fi's of all-time like Blade Runner and 2001, while milestones in their own right(especially visually), just do not have the sheer entertainment value that Star Wars has.97/100Star Wars and Empire are 2 of the 42 out of the 3400 films that I have ranked 10/10, and they are two of the most deserving, if not THE most deserving.","

"view_and_review","8 July 2004","One of my earliest cinematic memories was that of Luke Skywalker flying his fighter ship into the long canal in the Death Star and using the force to accurately fire two shots into its core to blow it up. Ever since I was 5 I've loved this movie and I have never tired of it's story and excellent special effects. This movie was well ahead of its time and was a true trend setter as is evident by how many movies after Star Wars have taken from it. It was masterfully written and directed with a great story to go with even more magnificent special effects. This movie was all inclusive for every movie goer: there was the science fiction part of it with glimpses of the future not too far from reality. There was the tale of good versus evil and even a sub-plot of religious versus irreligious with those who believed in the ""Force"" and those who didn't. And there was even a bit of chivalry with the rescue of the damsel in distress, Princess Leia. The characters were intriguing and all had their niche in the movie. Ultimately, how could you not like the movie that gave birth to Darth Vader, arguably the most notorious screen villain ever. This is just an epic saga which I can't say enough about.","

"zurnd","3 May 2013","May the fourth be with you everybody! Today, on Star Wars day, I figure it only fitting to review the film that started the whole starry craze, Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress! Nah, just kidding, it's Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope of course. It has been said countless times that Star Wars was based upon the Kurosawa samurai films as well as the Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s and 40s, but in my eyes, it's an all around fairy tale in space. Think about it, you've got the dashing, optimistic hero in Luke Skywalker, the wise, old mentor and hermit in Obi-Wan Kenobi, the damsel in distress mistress in Princess Leia, and the terrifying wizard with black attire in Darth Vader. It's like a Brothers Grimm tale or a tale written by L. Frank Baum, who you all know as the mind behind The Wizard of Oz. But what makes Star Wars great is something I can't sum up in one single review, but I'll certainly give it a try for your sake. This is 1977's Star Wars, the film that changed cinema forever. I can relate to this film on so many levels. I see a lot of myself in the characters of Luke Skywalker, C-3P0 and even the cocky Han Solo, a rebellious lad with a devil may care point of view. I can also look up to Obi-Wan Kenobi, who has become a lot like his master Qui-Gon Jinn by this episode. He has gone from a brash, outspoken padawan who viewed many creatures as useless to a wise old man who saw the potential in all creatures. I love Obi-Wan's wisdom and it's wisdom I live by every minute of everyday of my life. My favorite line of his is ""Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him?"" He has such a rich perspective of everything and his knowledge of the Force can give you the push you need to go about even the deadliest of tasks. It's his guidance that finally allows Luke to demolish the Death Star at the film's finale and it's probably something that will carry onto mentor Luke in the upcoming Star Wars Episode 7. Obi-Wan is the kind mentor we all wish we could get knowledge from so we could become wiser souls. Darth Vader is a menacing entity and is up there with the Wicked Witch of the West as one of film's greatest foes. The emotionless mask and deep dark voice of James Earl Jones really makes him ever more terrifying than he already is, but if you saw what he once was in Episodes 1,2 and 3, you tend to fear him less and less. It's hard to believe that underneath that breathing helmet is the charred face of Hayden Christensen, a once proud hero with a charming charisma. Little did we know that it would take him two more films until he finally reached his redemption and even than, it was before his untimely demise. Darth Vader is a motion picture icon, not only because of his wickedness and evilness, but because of his tragic past and his fight to gain back what he lost all those years ago. That's what makes an incredible villain, a villain that never wanted to be bad, but was thrust into badness because of one fatal decision.The other characters are also worthy of mention. Mark Hamill prevails as the adventurous, yet good hearted Luke Skywalker who would become the galaxy's most acclaimed hero towards the film's conclusion. Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia is a lot like Dorothy Gale or Alice in Lewis Carroll's classic Wonderland stories. Sure, she gets captured, but she's perfectly capable of defending herself and even defending her companions. She's a fearless woman who is not even afraid of kissing her long lost brother straight on the lips. Harrison Ford's Han Solo is probably the film's most memorable human character and with his headstrong and hipster attitude, he was what a lot of children wanted to be like when they first saw Star Wars back in 77. He's the ideal punk, but he's also the gallant hero and tough guy who's not scared to shoot down some green aliens (Who cares who shot first!) or stormtroopers. Personally, I became more fascinated with the non human characters like Chewbacca (Why didn't he get a medal!), R2-D2 and C-3P0, for like the humans, they were always trying to get the spotlight and give their share to the story. I feel like C-3PO is the most underrated character in all of Star Wars, for he is often seen as a symbol of homosexuality and annoyance. But Star Wars has a timeless story first and for most and this story gets better and better every time you experience it. Every time you experience it, you spot things you never spotted beforehand and that adds to the film's overall charm and magic. Even though it was made in the 70s, it still has the touch of a story that will last forever and never wear out. With all it's grand special effects (no matter what version of the film it is) and alien lifeforms, Star Wars is a storybook with a grand scale and a powerful, prudent moral that all creatures have a force flowing through them, allowing them to reach out and achieve the impossible.I'm not quite sure but I think that's why we love it so much. That's the reason I love it at least.","

"leonardogrump","5 October 2018","Film History began with A New Hope in 1977 and to this day its effects are being felt in Hollywood. Much has been said about A new hope and I do not need to add to it except for the fact that this film is fantastic- well paced and featuring the appearance of so many memorable characters and scenes. Lucas as a young man sure had an eye for details and it's a pity how he lost this ability by the time he started filming the prequels. The locations, atmosphere and camerawork is so different than the later films it is hard to imagine they were both directed by the same man. Anyway if you haven't already then please watch A new hope and then slowly make your way through the entire saga.","

"tml_pohlak_13","12 March 2009","Star Wars begins as a really dull, flat, and boring film. 25 minutes into the film, and I still couldn't care less about the main characters. To be perfectly honest, I considered turning off the movie at that point, ranking it a 1 on IMDb, and writing a harsh review. But about 5 minutes later, the film really picks up, coinciding with the first appearance of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). That's when the film becomes ""watchable"". It becomes entertaining as soon as Han Solo (Harrison Ford) appears.What's wrong with the first 25 minutes? It's just plain boring. Perhaps the biggest error is having the majority of the first 15 minutes spoken in an incomprehensible alien language. It is just so flat, that the appearance of Luke Skywalker does almost nothing to balance it out. But as soon as the plot picks up, it doesn't slow down.I also hate George Lucas' direction. His eternally wooden camera does little other than panning throughout this movie, and in fact, his career.James Earl Jones delivers an amazing performance as Darth Vader (O.K., I know he does only his voice, but still, that guy's voice is AMAZING!). Vader is the perfect choice for a movie villain: that mask is creepier than any deformed or disfigured face could be: always expressionless, constantly breathing heavily He's just plain, old-fashioned scary! This movie certainly has some fantastic acting, particularly from Harrison Ford, Alec Guinness, James Earl Jones (of course), and Mark Hamill (who would later voice the Joker in Batman: The Animated Series).Of course, the movie has its faults, especially when it comes to characters. Chewbacca and R2-D2 are quite possibly more annoying than watching Ace Ventura: The Animated Series.So overall, Star Wars begins very boring, but is very entertaining by the end.","

"stefanbe","5 July 2007","I don't think there's any denying that Star Wars changed cinema history and deservedly so. At the time of its release, science-fiction was considered a dead genre with the only major films from Hollywood's recent cannon being the work from Stanley Kubrick and cheesy, yet still fun flicks like Logan's Run. Yet, no other futuristic movie wowed more than George Lucas's space opera. From that infamous opening scroll, featuring that amazing heart-pumping score, to the end credits, people were gripped and hoping their heroes that had grown to know those two previous hours could come out alive. While, George Lucas did give his Jedi knights more adventures, I don't think any of those sequels and certainly not the prequels have managed to come close to the original Star Wars that practically defined the baby boom generation. Watching the film again recently, I am still impressed by the awesome power of the movie and the fact that even after thirty years after its release, it gets me more excited than the latest Hollywood blockbuster. Sorry, Michael Bay, but you're no George Lucas, that's for certain.After two droids crash-land on the desert planet of Tatooine, they are immediately captured and sold to a young farm boy called Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who desperately wants to leave the rock he lives on with his aunt and uncle. While fixing one of the droids, he finds a message from Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), requesting the help of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness). Luke finds Kenobi, a hermit living in the mountains, who tells Luke of his family history. His father was a Jedi knight, killed by the evil Darth Vader and now Kenobi decides it is time to teach him the way of the Force. After Luke finds his family's home destroyed by stormtroopers looking for the two droids, they decide to find their way to another planet. They enlist the help of space pirate Han Solo (Harrison Ford), who decides to give them a lift. On the way, they find the Death Star, a giant space station run by Darth Vader, with the ability to destroy any planet of the solar system. Now, they must enter the Death Star, find and rescue the Princess and destroy the station before it produces anymore harm.George Lucas has been criticised for his so-called lack of direction and screen writing abilities, but I don't think most people can deny that Star Wars packs a mean punch in terms of solid entertainment. While Star Wars is playing, all eyes are on the screen savouring every delicious moment, whether it be a fantastic lightsaber duel or a quiet scene between Luke and Obi-Wan. The visual effects (including those in the special editions) are seriously some of the best in motion picture history as they manage to make the viewer believe they're in space, surrounded by various creatures and flying ships. Lucas has gotten a lot of negative criticism for the fact that he believes that the updated version of Star Wars is the ultimate way to see the film, but I don't mind. The special effects are better and they certainly do add to the experience. Greedo shooting first? It's such a quick, minor scene that goes by at such a fast rate, that I don't really mind. I understand where the die-hard fans are coming from, but for the casual viewer, it's practically nothing. Adding to the impressive technical delight of Star Wars as well is John Williams's magnificent score, the best in any Hollywood film. I seriously don't think the film would be as highly regarded as it is, if it wasn't for the fantastic music. I seriously would probably enjoy the film even less without it.Yet, I think the lasting appeal of Star Wars has to be the characters. Every child growing up wants to be like Luke Skywalker, the young Jedi who just wants to save the universe from possible destruction. Meanwhile, the older folks in the audience have the wise Obi-Wan Kenobi to relate and as Yoda shows in the other five films, that old age does not remove one of their abilities. Han Solo represents the coolness of Star Wars and Harrison Ford plays him with enough spunk and gusto to warrant what might be a minor character as a personal favourite of mine. And then, there's Darth Vader, the most famous character and the most chilling villain of the 20th century. James Earl Jones will always be connected with with this constantly breathing menace with a past of many hidden secrets. Even the stormtroopers tremble in his wake, for fear that he will force-choke them to death. With thrilling action, impressive visuals, lovable and both frightening characters and a world full of fascination and adventure, it's hard to go wrong with Star Wars, the epic journey of our hearts and inner wants.","

"kenjha","12 October 2007","The one that began it all is also the best in the series. Whereas the later films become too bogged down with plot and perhaps take themselves too seriously, this one is just plain fun. It pays homage to the great adventure films of yesteryear, including ""The Searchers."" Hamill and Fisher failed to capitalize on the success of this series while Ford parlayed his role as the wise-cracking Han Solo into super-stardom. Despite his disdain for the film, Guinness is masterful as Obi-Wan. The majestic score by John Williams definitely adds to the excitement. Interestingly, Lucas did not direct the two sequels, but returned to direct the second trilogy.","

"seansworks","24 February 2012","How many influences did Lucas bring together for the first truly big sci-fi (ish) box office smash? Classic Samurai films, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Buck Rodgers. He took a clash of the greatest adventures of the first half of the twentieth century and brought them all into a single, sublime movie.Read/seen/played a kid with his parents/guardians murdered by the bad guys? Or a slightly mysterious/wise/cooky old teacher to teach the protagonist the ""ways"" of whatever? Or perhaps a grinning, sarcastic buddy that gets the protagonist out of trouble? Odds are if it was made sometime past 1977 you have Star Wars to thank for that.Heck, the very idea of background characters being named and rising to prominence is thanks to this movie. Or more specifically thanks to the toys eventually born out of it. Lucas negotiated the toy and merchandising rights and went right to work putting out every character there was, and since they had to have names in order to sell they were given names. Thus birthing the idea that characters once thought totally unimportant might be more than they seemed for fans of an IP.Oh, and as for the movie itself? One of the best scored movies in history, there might not be another movie in history with music more easily or widely recognizable than Star Wars. It was also written in a way so easy to wrap your head around that much of the dialogue can be recognized even by people that have seen it maybe once or twice.But the biggest claim I would make for the original Star Wars is that its the best edited and paced movie in history. Every movie study and screenplay writing example I've seen (and having taken college classes, and seen quite a few I have wide sample) has the original Star Wars as its perfect example of how to pace a movie. If you want to look for the perfect example of ""the roller-coaster"" of movie excitement, rising action spaced out with occasional dips, rising to a peak and then falling as the story ends are tied together; well, you're going to find its the original Star Wars.Like with any category of product or scientific field, forms of entertainment have things that shove them forward, that innumerable people after the fact owe a lot too. ""Standing on the shoulders of giants"" as it were. And Star Wars is one such thing, a giant of entertainment that so many works after it have stood upon to reach for their own heights.But even more important than that, it's just a damned fun movie. I've seen it more times than I care to admit. And yet even years later, years after the rabid Star Wars fanhood of my preteens has long faded, after I've grown bored and have little interest in seeing most any movie a second time I can still watch the original Star Wars and by the end have a huge grin on my face.","

"antialias11","3 October 2004","Well, I just re-watched this on DVD. I first saw it when I was 10 in 1981, and I still love this move (one of my all time favorites), but I guess I love it for some reasons different than most other people:1) The movie has no love story to speak of. This is such a huge bonus that it cannot be stressed enough. For kids a love story is sheer boredom - and there are unfortunately very few films without one. For adults the love story is usually pure BS (as the over romanticizing that goes on in Hollywood movies make any love story a nauseous experience. Episodes V and VI scrape the line of how much love story a movie can take before being totally corny. Lets not talk about how much the love story ruins episodes I and II (and will probably kill episode III also))2) There are no lengths in the movie. It dumps you right in the middle of the conflict after the opening (no opening credits to bore your pants off! This is almost unique amongst films). It practically grabs you before you have gotten comfortable in your seat. The DVD does add some lengths with gratuitous CGI which actually hurt the film more than they help (the ride into Mos Eisley and the Falcon approaching Yavin seem interminable compared to the fast paced cuts of the original version. These scenes break the rhythm of the movie badly, they add neither story nor depth nor information - luckily they are far enough apart not to hurt it too much)3) The special effects are still spectacular after all these years. Not in what they look like but how they are shot, the dynamics of it and the ideas for cool POVs (taking old aerial battle films as scripts was a stroke of genius)4) Detail. This thing is all about attention to detail. There is nothing out of place here. Nothing glossed over by large plastic sheeting. everything has structure and depth and looks used. The world it portrays becomes believable. economies are worked out. This has the look of a good role playing adventure.5) The plot isn't explained by the characters. Characters involved in such a plot for some time are supposed to know what the background is without having to talk to each other about it (nobody needs to be told that the empire is evil, this is common knowledge with these people as they have lived under it for decades). Putting things into the scroller at the beginning which could not be said by the characters because it would be akin to them holding up neon signs displaying ""For the audiences' information"" was a stroke of genius. I cringe at other movies that insert 'let me explain what is happening' scenes.Overall I can see nothing wrong with this movie. The soundtrack and the sound effects are amazing. Some scenes seem to be re-recorded with different sound standards and thus stand out uncomfortably, but this isn't much of a problem. The actors do their jobs well (especially Harrison Ford when he flashes that roguish grin - he is practically the archetype of the lovable, charismatic scoundrel). This DVD is definitely a keeper (10/10).","

"dataconflossmoor","15 December 2007","This was the introductory fanaticism of laser works, as well as a bevy of special sound effects, and elaborate sci-fi costuming, which started a whole new revelation in the cinema world. Steven Spielberg mastered the art of galactic warfare through a limitless use of creative weaponry!! The enormous popularity of this film opened the floodgates for copious movies about space battle in the ensuing years ahead!! Initially intrigued by the hit television show ""Star Trek"", the American public took to the movie ""Star Wars"" because it pinpointed a sort of personification of a video arcade wonderland, as a result, ""Star Wars"" utterly fascinated the movie audience!! Harrison Ford is one of the all time box office legends in Hollywood, his big break was with the movie ""Star Wars"",,, Later, of course, he captivated millions with his stellar performance in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""!! Movies like ""Star Wars"" do not come along very often, when they do, they set a precedent in the film industry!! I found the film ""Star Wars"" to be way ahead of it's time with regard to the optical gimmickry that they so superbly effectuated!! The music to ""Star Wars"" is classic in it's charismatic demeanor, and, by and large, it is understandable that the most prominent critics in the film industry rank ""Star Wars"" as one of the greatest movies ever made!! ""Star Wars"" is always chosen as one of the top twenty films in the American movie market by the esoteric and discriminating critics of AFI!! Endless accolades go out to ""Star Wars"" and the incredible ingenuity it possesses to entertain the American movie goer!! WITHOUT QUESTION!! FIVE STARS!!!!","

"mjsjsmith","29 May 2005","This has been by far the greatest movie of all time. The special effects are very fantastic especially when the movie was made before I was even born, even Return of the Jedi was made 7 years before I was born, or should I say it was completed 7 years before I was born. It's like George Lucas who's the Director for all the Star Wars movies including Episode III- Revenge of the Sith, it's like he went back in time a long time ago and he traveled to a galaxy far, far away. I must say George Lucas, I am very impressed. This probably did all happen a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. I just can't believe it, I mean how did he do it, this film is just ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. George Lucas can make any kind of movie he wants. He can even make a movie about what happens far before Star Wars Episode I- The Phantom Menace and he can even make a movie about what happens far after Star Wars Episode VI- Return of the Jedi. So George Lucas I have been a huge fan of Star Wars since I saw Episode IV when I was 5 and I'll be honest, I didn't really understand the storyline because I was only 5. But I was just amazed on the Special Effects, it was incredible for it's time, 1977. And when I turned 7 my mother bought the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition and it was even better with all new Advanced Digital Technology and I started to understand the storyline a lot better. And when I turned 14 I bought the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD and it got much better with one of the best pictures I have ever seen in a movie. But the Number 1 thing I hated about the DVD was that in Return of the Jedi at the very end of the movie you see the ghosts of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and Anakin Skywalker. I hated the fact that in the DVD you replaced Anakin Skywalker's ghost with the Anakin Skywalker from Episode II and Episode III. You shouldn't have done that George. It's great you re-modified the Trilogy and all with new technology but don't destroy the plot, because not even Luke Skywalker is going to have no idea who that person is, and you didn't make Obi-Wan Kenobi look like Ewan McGregor so I don't see why you did that. George try to re-modify Return of the Jedi that way it was before, the face that Luke Skywalker saw him as when he took off that black mask and helmet that Anakin Skywalker needs to live. Alright. That's all I have to say.","

"darkguardian-99861","2 April 2017","So, this is just a review I believe that should exist. Star Wars IV is a movie that the last year I have revisited a couple of times due to friends not having seen the original trilogy (shame on them).Admittedly, the story is a bit of a cliché: Captured princess, rescue, blowing enemy base. If you deny this you are lying to yourself.However, this movie has many things working in its favor. It has effects that are revolutionary for its time (they are still considered awesome), stunning scenery, it has nice action and the most amazing thing: Really fast pacing. Every time we reach the end credits I'm finding myself asking ""It's over?"" thirsting for more and thankfully there are 2 more movies.","

"Steviereno","30 June 2007","Back in 1977, I was able to go to the theater and go right into the theater in Kankakee, IL, and thought, ""Wow! Everyone everywhere else is standing in line, and we got right in!"" Then, two hours later, I was asking myself, ""What the hell? THAT was what all the hoopla is all about?"" I'd seen better science fiction flicks as a kid in the 50s.Prior to seeing it, a co-worker had gushed about it, and I asked him what it was about. He told me the plot, and when he got done, I asked, ""And then...?"" I thought he'd described the opening half hour. And he said, ""That's the story. That's all of it."" After watching it, I was still asking that question, ""Where is the rest of the story?""The plot was simplistic, the dialog inane (when everyone thought that about the three new Star Wars episodes, they were in the majority), the characters really 'flat' and not very interesting. C3P0 and R2D2 as comic relief were just plain inadequate.To this day, I think people were just sheep, thinking that they had to say wonderful things about this movie, so they did. The amazing thing to me is that 30 years later, they are still not seeing this as the average B-movie that it is.Look, I LIKE Harrison Ford, and I LIKE the other actors in the movie, especially Alec Guiness. Okay, Mark Hamill wasn't Larry Olivier, but he is at least likable. And James Earl Jones has the best voice ever. But for this movie to be considered one of the best 20 movies of all time? Color me out of the mainstream. I agree with probably 8 out of the other 19 top-20 movies, so I must not be too freaking alien. Why is this movie given such status? I just don't get it.","

"mweller","28 October 1998","Star Wars is a movie that has had great social impact, a fact that has often gone unnoticed.  A harbinger of a changing mood within the United States, Star Wars was one of the few movies rated General that was released in 1977. Where movies had for a decade been depicting ever more dark topics (Taxi Driver, The Exorcist) Star Wars was a lighthearted adventure.  While some may decry the move back to swashbuckling from social comment, I for one celebrate the fact that Star Wars made it possible for families to go to movies together once again.","

"masterandahalf","27 February 2007","Star Wars was my first non-Disney movie that I watched at the ripe old age of 8. Immediately I fell into another world, getting caught in a new mythology from a Galaxy far, far away. My siblings and I would play ""Star Wars"" in the back yard, saving the galaxy from evil. We would try to make my cousin into the ""A New Hope"" version of Princess Leia; my sister's hair was too short. My best friend at the time and I would be Jedi knights - we were 8 so it was okay to do this.The best thing I have ever done in my life is watch the Special Edition release of Star Wars. Sitting in the front row, hearing that surround sound and experiencing Star Wars in a way that no one had experienced it since the 1970s and 1980s - it was truly magical. The image of everyone in the theater standing up and cheering when the Death Star blew up sears in my mind forever and was the highlight of my entire movie-going experience. Why can't movies do that sort of thing anymore? Why cant they cause such inspiration for imagination anymore?","

The secret ingredient to this film is the once in a lifetime chemistry between the leads. Ford is the movie star, Hamill the heart and Fisher the sass. Together they bring humour, pathos and self awareness that is non-existent in the prequels. Light years ahead of its time 10/10.","

In short, I was thoroughly enthralled!However, I do have one bone to pick with the movie: the New Age themes.

"verbeekmarco","9 October 2013","It is now 36 years after this movie hit theaters, but it is not too late to write a review! This movie will and already is in the history books as the movie that changed the world! Star Wars, created by George Lucas, is the most iconic, awesome, epic and action-packed space opera ever made. This movie contains everything you want to see in a movie, for example: action, adventure, mystery, humor, emotion and, above all, creativity. The great visual and imaginative mind of George Lucas made it possible for other filmmakers to get from realistic movies to a generation of movies containing imagination and fantasy. The beginning of the movie is so perfectly written and makes it almost impossible for people not to like it. Firstly, the title scrawl. Although this scrawl was the same as the Flash Gordon series, in Star Wars this iconic and epic beginning was made great by the extraordinary music by John Williams. The music he composed made this movie what it is today and what it was then. His epic score for this movie was deservedly rewarded with an Academy Award. This great creation by George Lucas has influenced me, the American population and the rest of the world completely!!!","

"GOWBTW","9 March 2007","This is one sci-fi movie that is an absolute keeper! Star Wars is a gem. The characters, the plot, the technology, and the special effects really put you in a total state of awe. Here you have a walking tyrant named Darth Vader, a human iron lung who has a strong craving for power. He uses the mystical power known as The Force to get get anything in his will. The Force choke is wicked! Then you have Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill), a simple farm boy who wants to go to the academy, then he and his uncle purchased some droids that have some important information to an old Jedi named Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi(Alec Guinness), who has kept a light-saber from his old student Anakin Skywalker(Darth Vader). I liked the scene where Luke, Han Solo(Harrison Ford), and Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew) took out the StormTroopers. Then there's the Death Star battle. A real gem. When they showed the extra scenes later in the years, it's worth the watch even more! The commercials, the ads, the toys, the movie isn't a hit without them, and George Lucas will get kudos from me! 5 Stars!","

"TomiusJ","26 May 2005","Star Wars is the God of all movies. It is the greatest film to have ever been made, bar none. Nothing can be compared to it, nor should it be. It is definitive to our world, our society. It changed the way movies were made: for the better.In the 1970s, there was little unknown director named George Lucas. Little did he know (dispite a nightmarish shoot), that his galactic space opera would literally change the way people lived, worked, played and thought. The secret behind his success? His imagination.The script, the characters, the events, the locations, the humour, the opening, the ending... all perfect. Of course, it's not the most well-shot movie of all time, but there's no denying that nobody actually cares. Star Wars has become a cult and a religion, and earned it's place in my heart as the greatest film to have ever been made......Millions will agree.Whatever I say cannot reach the real truth behind Star Wars: just watch it and you'll know exactly what I mean.The force will be with us, always.Overall: A definitive masterpiece. Will never be forgotten, and will remain in the hearts of young and old for generations. Perfect. (10/10)","

"DaveInTheCave","27 December 2011","Star Wars is great cinema. One of the great things about it is the visuals, the opening shot where the Star Destroyer flies over while chasing the Rebel Blockade Runner is amazing. The music is also fantastic, it evokes early epic movie scores by the likes of Erich Wolfgang Korngold and Miklos Rozsa and also hearkens back to Classical music in the romantic period, especially to Wagner and Holst. The characters and story are somewhat basic but that's part of whats great about the movie, it has an archetypal, mythic quality.Some have said that the only reason this movie is highly regarded is because of people who as as children and idolize it for nostalgic reasons, well as someone who saw for the first time at the age of 16, I can attest that it's stands on it's own very well.It does have a few flaws. The dialogue can be corny at times. Luke's remorse over his aunt and uncles death seems rather short lived, particularly compared to his sadness over Ben Kenobi's death. Despite these flaws Star Wars is still an excellent film. Highly recommended!","

It tells the story of young farmer Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who, along with smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford), engages in the Galactic Civil War between the tyrant Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance after acquiring the Droids R2-D2 and C3PO. That first contains the plans for the Empire's super weapon, Death Star, which rebel leader Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) hopes to use to destroy the super weapon. Luke Skywalker dreams of going to the Academy like his friends, but finds himself embroiled in an intergalactic war when his uncle buys two robots and finds a message from Princess Leia Organa to jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi about the plans to build the Star of the Moon. Death, a gigantic space station capable of destroying a planet. Luke then joins the jedi gentlemen and Hans Solo, a mercenary, to try to destroy this terrible threat alongside the members of the resistance.

"Michael_Elliott","18 December 2015","Star Wars (1977) **** (out of 4) Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) joins forces with Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) as they plan to go after Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) who is being held hostage by Darth Vadar.Whether people like it or not, STAR WARS is one of those ground-breaking movies that became a massive hit and it eventually took over the world. Watching the film so many years later it really is amazing what George Lucas was able to do with this film and what would follow. I will gladly admit that I'm not a fanboy of this series and in fact this recent viewing was the first time I had seen this since it was released in its Special Edition form. With that said, even though I'm not a ""fanboy"" it's impossible to deny that power that this film contains.Storywise there's really nothing overly ground-breaking here but in my opinion that's what makes the film so darn good. There's no long-winded or drawn-out story to drag things down. The basic premise is rather simple as an up-and-coming fighter gets his opportunity to be great and sets out to do so. I think this simple story makes the characters stand out all the better because it really gives them a chance to shine and come to life. It certainly also helps that Lucas was clearly a fan of those cliffhangers from previous decades because he knows how to build up scenes and milk them for everything they're worth.It's really hard to say anything fresh or new about this film but watching this first one it's easy to see why people like Hamill and Fisher became iconic in these parts. Both are quite good in the film as are Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing, the two veterans of the picture. With that said, I think it goes without saying that it's Harrison Ford who really stands out in the role of Han Solo. His comic timing with Chewbacca has made for some of the most memorable moments of this film and he's simply delightful to watch in the role.Of course, fans will debate the tinkering that Lucas has done with the picture but I think both versions hold up extremely well. I understand the purist who want to view what they originally saw in theaters and I understand those who defend the updating of the effects. Either way, STAR WARS is a rare blockbuster that also manages to be extremely well-made and deserving of its reputation.","

"ronakkotian","23 November 2019","Back in the 60s, it was mesmerizing to see Stanley Kubrick create an out of this world (literally!) film known as 2001: A Space Odyssey but what George Lucas made in 1977 started a huge trend in culture known as Star Wars.Star Wars: A New Hope follows Luke Skywalker as he teams up Han Solo, Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO and R2-D2 to destroy the Empire's most destructive station and save Princess Leia from the evil mastermind named Darth Vader.Just imagine watching a movie like this in the late 70s. It would have been nothing like anything else shown in the theatres before. The film had a reported budget of $11 million and the effects even today still hold up. It's astounding to see something so original and unique be made for it to become one of the biggest pop culture phenomenons. The film looks gorgeous. A lot of creatures shown and fight sequences look real making the realism stay throughout.The characters are really well written. Mark Hamill portrays Luke perfectly. His transformation from a whiny kid to a mature leader was great to see and this arc added so much depth to him. Carrie Fisher fit right in the role of Princess Leia. She's not the standard damsel in distress you would see normally because Lucas fleshed out her character completely accompanied with Fisher's mannerisms and dialogues. Then we have the almighty Harrison Ford playing one of the best characters to ever exist. Ford lives and breathes as Han Solo as he is so entertaining to watch and has great chemistry with Hamill and Fisher. We also have Alec Guinness who played Obi-Wan Kenobi perfectly. Finally we have one of the most iconic villains, Darth Vader. Lucas made Darth Vader also interesting to watch by showing off his power and leadership to audiences to really show how evil he may be.A New Hope has so many great scenes (the bar scene) and character interactions that keep the flow going without a second of boredom. The concluding battle is something so intense and fascinating to watch. You being to wonder how they created it in the 70s. It must have been spellbinding and hypnotic to see something as cool and fun as Star Wars at the time of its release. It's filled with many memorable characters, awesome VFX and action sequences that'll make you root for each and every one of the protagonists. This was the start of a legacy that kept millions of fans eager and excited to see the rest of the series.","

"raphaklopper","22 September 2013","Before the genius George Lucas was about to go help Spielberg make the majestic "" Raiders"", he decided to do something, something that many were surprised when it was announced and didn't take a lot of faith on, which after his release was an absolute success both at the box office and critical, and today the masterpiece of Lucas is a classic that will live forever in the history of cinema! ""Star Wars"" (not Star Wars IV A New Hope, please), begins with the yellow title suddenly appearing on the screen with an amazing soundtrack from the master John Williams giving us a resume of the history we are about to watch. It all starts with a small spaceship full of rebel soldiers start being invaded by imperial troops led by the sinister and cruel lord Darth Vader (David Prowse). Suddenly the film transports us directly to another side of the galaxy where we have the story of the young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a simple machine repairman teenager who lives with his uncles. A day after his uncle buy two servant robots, R2 - D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), which inadvertently bring Luke the chance to realize his dreams of becoming a rebel and fight against the tyrant of the empire, a mission that will take him to the ends of the galaxy and will bring new friends but at the same time extreme dangers.From the beginning, ""Star Wars"" revolutionized cinema forever, especially the genre of sci - fi that at the time was just ""Star Trek"" with great success. Lucas of course certain elements form ""Trek"", since the crew of a spaceship with name style and friendship among the crew, but everything else was a tremendous attack of originality. Unlike ""Star Trek"" Lucas took the story and the great adventure with a lighter and fantasy tone, not childish but humorous, fun and even a certain religious point when the Jedi Obi - Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) appears in Luke's life with secrets of him and Luke's father past.And just like ""Star Trek"", Lucas gave his masterpiece unforgettable characters, of course: Luke, R2, C-3PO, Obi-Wan. But also the unforgettable Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the bounty hunter from space who ALWAYS shoots first and asks questions later, giving the film a great humorous touch and a lot of fun (never one character caused such influences as Han Solo did), and even Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) no royal woman before her in a film had never taken up arms showing she knew very well how to take care of herself. Not only the good guys who stand out perfectly in the story, but also the great and unforgettable antagonist ever put to film, Darth Vader, no villain was so cruel and yet so adored by fans.Characters and stories fitting perfectly, but the adventure to be full completed it needed the huge Galactic scenario, which is not lacking in this film. I think Lucas should have thanked Kubrick about ""2001"" because if it were not for this film, visual effects would never be the same. And thanks to that Lucas gave the film with beautiful scenery and a vast galaxies and an unforgettable and thrilling final battle.The classic that redefined cinema forever with a story well-crafted and told, full of suspense, humor and adventure thanks to its unforgettable characters and stunning visual effects , the legendary George Lucas gave the world a film with tremendous quality and early one of the best trilogies ever made.10/10","

"nymeria-meliae","5 January 2016","There are two major problems with this film... 1) the plot 2) the actingI think this film is so popular largely because of childhood nostalgia. It is essentially a children's film.Spoiler? The Plot: When stripped to its bare bones the plot is essentially... princess gets kidnapped by evil sorcerer. Wannabe knight is trained by wizard to rescue princess from sorcerer. Wizard is killed by sorcerer. Knight comes back and destroys sorcerer's dragon (aka death-star). With the exception of death-star = dragon, each character is referred to according to those titles. Obi Wan is called a wizard by Luke's uncle. Darth Vader is referred to as having sorcerer's ways. Luke is to train to be a Jedi Knight... and Leia is a princess. A typical children's fairy tale story... and the twist being that it is set in space. The acting at times is so wooden that it is cringe worthy. Everyone has fond memories of this film from their childhood... and the reason why people don't like Return of the Jedi or the prequels is largely because they have grown up and have forgotten that this was a children's movie and was merchandised as a child's movie. However, if you look at it again on its merits as a film... it is actually quite a poor over-rated movie. It's one saving grace other than nostalgia is the model making and special effects for the time of its release were impressive but no more so than some previous sci-fi movies.","

"Al_The_Strange","5 May 2013","In the summer of 1977, during a time when most motion pictures were all about being rough and gritty, Star Wars exploded onto the scene with its fresh take on classic adventurism and epic storytelling. The immense popularity that followed ensured that it beat the odds against a skeptical studio that never saw the viability of the franchise, and ensured its resounding success for decades. It has since become the progenitor of all modern blockbuster films.Whether you start the series here or with the modern prequel The Phantom Menace, you'll be immediately submerged into a unique and original universe. Great care and consideration is placed into every person, place, and thing in the series, with an exceptional level of background and detail. Entering the Star Wars universe is one of the deepest and most lively franchises, even to this day.The story kicks off right in the middle of a big space pursuit, and maintains steadily fast pacing throughout. The original special effects have always been impressive, with loads of quality models and matte paintings that still hold up. There are a number of added CGI scenes from the '97 update, which haven't aged that well. But what really matters is the spirit of the movie; whether lurking around the seedy underbelly of Mos Eisley, or storming the decks of the Death Star, the movie is loaded with action and comedy, and it takes itself seriously only when it has to. The resulting thrill ride is as lighthearted as it is exciting and memorable.Borrowing directly from Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, and with some influence by classic sci-fi serials like Buck Rogers, the story for this is not terribly original, but it is a solid and fresh take on the genre, with a cast of fine characters. The biggest and most original contribution is Luke Skywalker's journey from being a humble farm boy to being the hero of the Rebel Alliance (featuring themes that echo Lucas' previous film American Graffiti). The film's structuring allows for a steady introduction to all the characters and concepts, making it easily digestible and continuously iconic.The film is competently-made, with solid photography and editing. Special effects are groundbreaking for its time. At times, I feel that the imagery with the given camera angles, lighting effects, costume and set designs, are like an evolution of THX1138, lending the film a slick futuristic appeal. Acting tends to be a bit hammy in all the Star Wars films, but are probably at their best here; Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Sir Alec Guinness bring the characters to life in a vivid and memorable way. Writing can be quite nutty, but the dialogue is memorable. All of the film's sets, props, costumes, and special effects are swell, even if they do show their age a little. And the music is excellent; John Williams' original score matches the movie perfectly, and is exceptional.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)","

"Li_85","23 June 2006","I don't know what is so great about this film that bores. So it was released in the 70s, that time there must of been better films. It has this stupid villain Darth Vader that irritates with his voice. If he is so powerful that he can kill with his mind. Why doesn't he just kill off the Heroes in that way, then wasting time. This movie is very childish, full of boring characters that annoy. There is a fight scene where Harrison Ford is shooting at 100s of Robots with lazer guns. Not a single shot gets him, how is that possible. I have worked in a cinema for over 2 years and witnessed the release of Revenge of the Sith. I am shocked that all these hundreds of people like this garbage.","

"winner55","3 August 2006","Paul to the Corinthians - 'when i was a child, i thought as a child and played as a child; but when i became a man, i put away my childish things.' i was living near new york city when this film was first released - i think this was a test release in the new york area; the original promo suggested a serious science-fiction story, along the lines of the cult-favorite 'dune'. it bombed. shortly afterward, on re-release Lucas got the promo he really wanted - part fairy-tale, part Jungian Ur-myth, part retro-serial - and the rest is history. but the history of what -this film marks the beginning of the end of serious film-making in America. fairy-tales are for children; the old serial films were fun, but badly made; and 'Jungian Ur-myths' constitute a debatable psycho-babble theory; thus what Lucas was really telling his audience, in both film and promo, was that we all needed to be children watching bad films written by Carl Jung - or at least Jungian literary theorist Joseph Campbell, who was actually hired as consultant on this film.humans, to maintain their self-respect, need to grapple with difficult moral issues, we need to mature, and to learn how to relate to other human beings in complex and sometimes difficult situations; and we need the freedom to think for ourselves in such matters, to risk our own happiness and to live with the consequences. no one is saying that children should not enjoy fairy-tales, and perhaps they really do need these for psychological development. but even eventually children need to 'grow-up' - to stop being children.'star wars' would not have been so damaging to this culture if it had presented itself as a children's film. but Lucas was quite explicitly targeting, as audience, burnt out hippies, participants of the failed 'cultural revolution' of the '60s; and in doing so, he began steering them toward the political decisions that would at last put our culture and its economy, and its future, into terrible jeopardy - voting for Reagan, selfishly demanding tax cuts, mockery of dissent and dissenters, and flocking into paganistic 'fundamentalist Christian' churches seeking 'spiritual awakening' and, as many now proclaim, apocalypse.well, obviously, just one movie isn't going to accomplish all that. what the success of star wars did was to distract adult attention from ethically mature films where moral choices could be examined in their complexity; to such an extent that Hollywood - never all that supportive of such films, anyway - simply stopped making such films for a time. the bottom came in 1985, when the 2 best films to use truly cinematic storytelling to wrestle with mature choices were from japan - Kurosawa's 'ran' and 'Godzilla 1985'. and you know the world's doomed when a big green lizard has to be the one to make you ask important questions about the ecology, and history, and whatever place in the larger universe our tiny species finds itself.i mention Godzilla not simply for rhetorical effect. like the old fairy-tales, Godzilla is best appreciated by the young and the young at heart; like the old serial films, the Godzilla films are filled with gaffs and silliness; like the typical Jungian Ur-myth or archetype, Godzilla calls to some deeper part of our psyche, which is why we are entertained by his appearance.but unlike star wars, the Godzilla films never insist that they are the only show around - or at least the only worth viewing. and unlike star wars, they never pretend to be better than they are, or that they're accomplishing some necessary cultural mission. and unlike star wars, they do not insist that we remain 'forever young', only that we respect our having once been young, and that we respect the youth of others. and unlike star wars, they are inherently democratic - not because they insist we all be individuals, but rather that they insist that we all are already individuals, and yet to survive, we must come together and learn to depend on one another - democracy only has value to a collective of individuals, a human society. rabid individualists are monsters - rather like Godzilla's most intractable foe, king ghidorah.well, that's the big argument. for those who prefer simple solutions - star wars is a crude, fascistic, socially-retarded scam that the ex-hippies foisted on what was once a great culture. whether it will ever achieve greatness again - or whether it shall have cinema when it does - remains open to question.'now we see as through a glass, darkly, but then face to face.'","

"Hitchcoc","16 November 2001","I will never forget the hoopla associated with this movie.  Having seen articles in Time and Newsweek, my friend and I took off early from work and made our way to the one theater in the Minneapolis Metro area that was showing ""Star Wars"" (boy have times changed!).  There were local news stations, reporters, models, everywhere.   How we were able to just walk to the window and purchase tickets, I don't know, but we did. I still have my blue button with ""May the Force be With You"" emblazoned on it.  I'm told it's pretty valuable.  A reporter approached us and asked my friend, ""What do you expect.""  He responded in his sort of wise ass way, ""A sprawling intergalactic epic.""That was all very interesting, but when we finally sat down and the movie began, I found it was less than I had hoped for.  Part of my problem was that at that time, most of what I read was science fiction.  As I watched the events unfold, I realized that this movie wasn't really science fiction--it was a Western.  It was the good guy versus the bad guy and an effort to save the old ranch that the bad guys have pillaged.  Take out the awesome special effects and the cool aliens and it just wasn't very interesting.  I realize that most of the people that have seen this consider it just slightly below the second coming--nearly a religious experience--but it wasn't for me.  I saw nothing new or complex about the character or the themes in the movie.  As far as speculative science fiction it is barren. Don't get me wrong, I still think that there are amazing things to watch, but I can't get past the fact that the storm troopers can't hit the broad side of a barn with laser weapons but the good guys can pick off about a dozen from behind a post.  Where did these guys get their training?  How has the Empire survived so long with these incompetents. Having read ""Dune"" years before this film came out, I have to be brutally honest--how George Lucas didn't get sued for stealing from that book, I'll never know.  I always wondered if he made a deal with Frank Herbert.The worlds are exotic.  The aliens are wonderful (although, I thought the second and third movies were much better), especially that bar scene. But the bottom line is that it's an adventure movie.  Maybe someday someone will convince me otherwise (I have had about 50 people try). If I'm going to watch a Western, I prefer the Earps and Doc Holliday.","

"artemis_5","3 February 2004","""Star Wars"" became a movie classic because it was intelligent science fiction that went beyond what had been done before in the genre.  Lucas' space opera incorporated themes from world mythologies into a movie that both adults and children could appreciate.  The result was a franchise that had both popular and intellectual appeal.  I have heard college students discuss the Star Wars trilogy as if it were the ""Illiad"", and it does not seem silly at all for them to do so.What was the appeal of ""Star Wars.""  The first film in what is now sometimes referred to as ""the original trilogy"" (to distinguish it from the prequel trilogy) introduced the movie audience to ""the force,"" which had both a dark side and a light side; as well as a ""will"".  The universe at the beginning of Star Wars is controlled by an evil Empire, which is in turn being resisted by the ""Alliance.""  The movie begins with the capture of an Alliance ship by an Imperial cruiser.  As the movie's villain, Darth Vader, boards the ship in search of secret plans stolen by the Alliance, two droids (including one who has the missing plans) jettison to the surface of the planet around which the Alliance cruiser was orbiting.  There they encounter a young farmer (Luke Skywalker), whose father (Anakin Skywalker) was a pilot in the ""Clone Wars"" (an important war, as we later find out), and an aging jedi knight named Obi Wan Kenobi (the jedi's having the power to use ""the force"" for combat and enlightenment).  As the movie progresses, the jedi knight teaches the young farmer the jedi skills, and they join forces with a blockade runner named Han Solo and a princess named Leia, to fight the evil Empire.This movie brilliantly sets the stage for events that occur during the next two films, but you have to see the entire trilogy to fully appreciate Lucas' contribution.**Note: While it might be tempting in light of the release of the prequel trilogy to see them first, I think that it is best to see the original first, with the prequel trilogy filling in the gaps later.","

"Quinoa1984","19 February 2000","Star Wars is a film that started it all.  Not only the beginning of a 6 movie saga, but many other things as well.  The film takes many things as influence (Shakespeare's Hamlet, Flash Gordon serials, old voodoo stuff, and Stanley Kubrick's 2001) and it turns it into a terrific movie experience. Some scenes are not all there, but they are made up for the extraordiary space fights and great quotes ""May the Force be With You"".  So, all hail to George Lucas for creating a timeless masterpiece such as this and for many other things (by the way though, even though I think this film is well done, Episode 5 is my favorite).","

"dee.reid","28 June 2005","It seems that the honoring of George Lucas with the Lifetime Achievement Award could not have come at a better time for the visionary and imaginative filmmaker. With ""Episode III"" still raking in sold-out crowds six weeks after its release, Lucas is pretty much on top of the world. But what about the film that started it all, ""Star Wars"" (1977)? What's left to say about it? Every good thing that has and can be said about it has been said already, ever since it debuted in the summer of '77 and changed the way we looked at movies, and the way people made them. ""Star Wars"" is sheer imagination run amok, taking place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, with farmboy Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) discovering the two droids C-3PO and R2-D2, the latter droid of which contains a holographic image of a distress call from Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). The Princess is being held captive by Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) and his fearsome military commander Darth Vader (played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones), the dark lord of the Sith, on the newly constructed Death Star battle station. Skywalker, taking advantage of an opportunity to leave behind boring farm life, seeks out the mysterious Obi Wan Kenobi (the late Alec Guiness, in an Oscar-nominated performance) and the two journey to a Mos Eisley watering hole to enlist the aid of swashbuckling space pirate Han Solo (Harrison Ford), pilot of the Millennium Falcon, and his Wookie sidekick Chewbacca - their adventures resulting in them joining the Rebel Alliance - culminating in one of the greatest screen battles, which is the Rebel assault on the Death Star at the film's climatic conclusion. Lucas brought forth this ambitious vision to stunning reviews and a devoted fanbase that has established ""Star Wars"" as a subculture within pop culture. It's impossible to call this film dated in any fashion, given that Lucas often had to resort to imagination to get things done on this project since budget constraints allowed for such creativity. When I saw ""Star Wars"" for the first time when I was kid, it took my breath away, as I'm sure it did to everyone else that saw it for the first time. That initial viewing sticks with you, and as a result the film never looses its impact. ""Star Wars"" was of course followed by the somber ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) and the triumphant ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983), both of which are also considered classics in themselves. And with the prequel trilogy (1999's ""The Phantom Menace,"" 2002's ""Attack of the Clones,"" the aforementioned 2005 conclusion ""Revenge of the Sith"") out of the way, there is word out that Lucas isn't done with ""Star Wars,"" and may be looking to start a new trilogy. But with all this, we still need to look back at the film that started it all, the film with nothing left to talk about, the original ""Star Wars"" (1977).10/10","

Lukes' relatives, have been killed by the Storm Troopers,relieving him to explore the cosmos, become a Jedi Knight, help the Rebel Alliance, and free the Galaxy !!!The special effects were so advanced, because it allowed freedom of movement, which was incredibly unique, way ahead of its time !!!Can Luke become a Jedi Knight, will the Empire triumph ?Who is Darth Vader ? Stay tuned thru 2 more sequels, the watch the 3 prequels, all of your questions will be answered!!! A Great Movie for its time, but somewhat dated by the evolution of the same technology that created this film!!! See how it all began, way back in 1977, the highest grossing film of that year !!!","

"Leofwine_draca","3 January 2017","Okay, so as a kid this was one of my favourite films. But as you grow up things change and on second viewing, I found this film to be surprisingly slow in places and actually comes close to outstaying its welcome towards the end. These aren't big flaws, mind you, but ones which niggle at me and make me feel as if I'm betraying a universal dream in some way. The truth is that I far prefer the second and third entries in this series, as they don't have to go through the troubles of introducing all the characters, and instead can simply continue the action at a fast speed.There are many good things about this film to make it worthwhile, though. This is one of those movies with a comic book feel to it which can appeal to adults and children alike. There's a sufficiently 'epic' nature to the film, in that a whole other universe has been created and we are merely viewing a part of what happens in it. There's plenty of action, ranging from the traditional light-saber fights to some exciting space skirmishes. The huge budget allows for many, many different special effects. Some of these look a little ropey today but they're all infinitely superior to the overblown, laughable CGI antics in THE PHANTOM MENACE, where all touch with reality was lost.The characters are likable and clear-cut; you've got heroic heroes and evil villains. Mark Hamill is fine as Luke Skywalker, although it's sad that he never achieved success in any other movies NOT in the STAR WARS series. Harrison Ford provides a clean, charismatic action man in Han Solo. Carrie Fisher is pretty and funny as Princess Leia, and Alec Guinness lends heavyweight support to the whole affair with his Obi-Wan Kenobi. The only downside to the cast are the inclusion of the robots C3P0 and R2-D2 and Chewie, who are, seen today in an adult light, pretty irritating, it has to be said. But for kids, they're funny.The villains always tend to be the best guys in these films and this is no exception. Darth Vader is THE king of cool, and I always wanted to be him when I was younger. It's strange to think how strongman Dave Prowse when from being the monster in Hammer's lame HORROR OF FRANKENSTEIN to becoming one of the biggest screen villains of all time. One also mustn't forget the contribution of Peter Cushing in what was his most popular movie; he lends gravity to the movie and is excellent as the icy commander of the Death Star, mainly through his voice alone.Although this is a long film, the action is split up across a number of different planets in order to make it more interesting. There are laser battles, lots of shooting, brief gore (an arm-lopping), and all manner of weird and wonderful rubbery alien creatures to make it enjoyable. I especially loved the scene in the garbage disposal unit which uses the old ""closing walls"" routine on our heroes to great effect. This is a deservedly famous movie which kick-started a whole new mythos, brought a legion of movie nerd fans together and harked back to the great days of the sci-fi serials of the late '30s and '40s. Not the best of the series, but pretty darned good going.","

Obviously, this is probably one of the top five most famous movies of all time, and it has truly withstood the test of time. It doesn't suffice to call ""Star Wars"" a sci-fi, a fantasy, or anything really; it is everything that a movie could be. Looking back on it, we notice that it was actually pretty low tech (which is part of why ""Episode 1"" was so bad).Well anyway, the point is that George Lucas created the ultimate masterpiece here.

I was awoken by my father, he was asking me if I wanted to go see a movie. ""It has spaceships, and robots, and lasers, you'll love it!"" I looked at him through swollen eyes and asked, ""does Jenna get to go to?"" When I heard him say no, I knew I was in for a HUGE treat. We arrived at a nearly empty theater, and took our seats. When the first jarring chord of the theme hit me, and my father began reading the opening story, I was captivated. It was the happiest day of my life. To hell with all your nitpicking. When something makes that great an impression on a four year old, you know it has to be something truly special. By the way, I'm wearing the Boba Fett t-shirt my son's mother gave me as a gift.

Lucas' vision was realized to its full potential and William's score carried the film to being the most successful film ever made, behind the hunk of crap titanic. The story was one the most original I've ever come across and the movie itself sparked the career of Harrison Ford, quite possibly one of the biggest actors in the 1980's and 90's. Although this was the first and last original Star Wars film to be directed by Lucas, it was quite possibly the best film to hit the market in the 1970's.","

"TxMike","7 October 2004","My five children were all under the age of 10 when Star Wars came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, 'Star Wars' filled our imaginations like no other movie before it. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.The Star Wars movies also were responsible for jump-starting the career of Harrison Ford, and today he is probably better known for his next trilogy, as Indiana Jones. The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them.","

"hansololover","18 April 2005","This movie, along with the whole original trilogy, just blows me away! It truly has all the elements a good story needs. The characters have suction cups all over them that glue them to your memory, because they're just so great! The story revolves around young Luke Skywalker, a farm boy who wants more adventure in his life. Adventure finally arrives to him in the form of two droids, sent by Princess Leia, a beautiful woman begging someone named Obi-Wan Kenobi for help. Leia is a huge part of Rebel Alliance, a group of people determined to stop the Empire's reign of terror and evil. When Luke meets up with Obi-Wan, they set out to deliver plans inside the droid to Leia's father, plans that can stop the most destructive weapon ever from destroying any planet that stands up for good. Teaming up with a cocky pilot who is more caring than he lets on named Han Solo and his CoPilot Chewbacca (big dog/ape/bigfoot like creature) the heroes are thrust into adventure beyond Luke's wildest dreams, complete with a heroine, henchmen, space ships, battles and the most menacing villain a movie has ever seen.Star Wars is a movie you won't forget soon after watching it. It's full of excitement, humor, romance (more so in the ESB, the sequel), great dialogue danger, and a never tiresome fight between good and evil. I recommend the trilogy to anyone and everyone who hasn't seen it (that would be...3 people...don't worry though, I'm a pretty newly converted fan too!) Han Solo rocks! May the force be with you all. 10/10","

"Hey_Sweden","19 July 2012","There's hardly anything this reviewer can say that hasn't already been said, and said better, numerous times before, about this milestone in cinema and the popular culture. The story, of a simple farm boy from an isolated desert planet meeting his destiny as one of the brave souls fighting an evil intergalactic organization, is wonderful fantasy in a science-fiction setting.The mythology it creates ensures its staying power, as well as the many endearing and entertaining characters we meet along the way. There's the reckless, macho mercenary Han Solo (Harrison Ford) who learns something about doing things for others rather than just himself, the wizened old warrior Ben / Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) who instructs our young hero Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on the ways of the ""Force"", the young Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) determined to right the wrongs being perpetrated in this universe, the loyal anthropoid spaceship co-pilot Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), the menacing bad ass that is the black garbed Darth Vader (David Prowse / voice of James Earl Jones), and the odd couple robots R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) who provide us with a healthy amount of comedy relief.The movie is cast to perfection, with old pros like Peter Cushing and Mr. Guinness supporting the talented up and comers Hamill, Ford, and Fisher. A team of technical wizards, who pioneered some ingenious special effects, bring us from one visually astounding environment to another, from the desert wastes of Tatooine to the stark efficiency of the armoured space station The Death Star. John Williams, the man behind some of the most instantly recognizable soundtracks of all time, supplies the iconic score here that lets us know, right from the first moments of the film, that we're in for a good time.Of course, those of us who have become extremely familiar with the film over time would give anything to once again be experiencing it for the first time, which is why it's a joy to see it with younger viewers as they are introduced to its sense of wonder. It's equal parts thrilling, suspenseful, and humorous, and gives us an effective final dogfight in space equivalent to that of an old time war movie.Just speaking personally, this has great resonance for me as it was one of those treasured films of my youth and one had better believe that I was a proud owner of a number of the toys. I always looked forward to a viewing and even as an adult when I know what to expect, the fun factor of the thing still comes through strong.This is definitely one of those films that cinema lovers ought to see at least once in their lifetime.Nine out of 10.","

"lastliberal","19 May 2007","Has it been 30 years since we first enjoyed one of the most spectacular films of the 20th Century. This film is older than many of the people I know.Volumes have been written on the creativity and innovation that was brought forth by George Lucas. This film had it all: sets, costuming, visual effects, music, writing and directing. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were light years behind the rest of America when they ignored this film for some Woody Allen comedy. They really showed their bias there! It is hard to believe Harrison Ford had been around for 10 years before this film. He seemed so young and fresh, and we know he goes on to some great work after wards. He is the one I remember most fondly from the film. Of course, one will never forget Chewbacca.","

"Dockelektro","15 May 2002","This one was the dawn of a new way to see movies. This movie created a heritage, and a cult movemement that will probably never end. ""Star Wars"" is by far the greatest cult movie ever, and it changed the way people make and see sci-fi today. Of course, this was a tightrope work, and it shows. The success wasn't insured, and George Lucas really risked it here, and one can tell by the quality of the overall movie that this one wasn't so financed as Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi. But it remains an absolute classic, and the Special Edition in 1997 really souped it up, adding cool effects and new sequences, making the experience even better. This movie started a legacy, and even today, one the eve of seeing the new chapter, I know I can see it without getting tired. The force will always be with the people who see this.","

"sddavis63","5 February 2016","A confession right off the top: I'm not a Star Wars fan. This original came out when I was a teenager. Everyone was so into it that I finally had to watch it. I did. And I didn't like it. I realize that puts me very much in the minority, but - whatever - I just didn't like it. I was totally bored with it for the most part and I've never watched it or any of its sequels (or prequels) since, until I rewatched this just a few days ago. My brother in law decided that my daughter had to be introduced to the Star Wars phenomenon, so he brought the DVDs of those first three movies over and we sat and watched the first one. My daughter's 11 - and wise. She agreed with me. ""Do we have to watch the other two, dad? I was bored."" ""Yes, honey, your uncle brought them over to watch with us, so we'll watch them when he's over."" So, eventually, I'll get to watch ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi."" I'm as enthusiastic as my daughter.So, to this movie. I was still bored with it. It has one of the least interesting beginnings I've ever come across. It's a struggle to watch the first hour or so. And once the action really starts - it's just a gigantic space battle, and I just don't buy that good old Luke Skywalker can go from farm boy to ace fighter pilot like that. And really you have to mix in some pretty weak performances - especially from the two main leads. There's a reason that Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher never really did much after Star Wars. They're just not that good! Harrison Ford is the only one who managed to turn his role in this into a big-time acting career - but, let's face it, most people remember him as Indiana Jones and not Han Solo. Granted that George Lucas got some big names in this - Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan Kenobi and James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader. But the newer, younger crowd of actors just wasn't that good. And then there were the aliens. Some of the worst looking aliens I've ever seen - especially in the bar scene in Mos Eisley. I really loved the alien who looked like a green-ish burlap sack with bright buttons sewed on for eyes. Add on some ridiculous dialogue and irritating droids who get far too much of the ridiculous dialogue to top it off.Those are things that stand out for me that just didn't work for me. I'm not dissing ""Star Wars"" completely. There were some good things about it. Give George Lucas credit for imagination. This was a very interesting and imaginative universe he created. And the space battles were pretty well done - I just thought there was too much of it. And let's face it - Darth Vader has become an iconic character; one of the greats in Hollywood history. Everybody knows Darth Vader - whether they like Star Wars or not. And ""the Force."" Who doesn't know about ""the Force."" Something has worked well when characters and other things get sealed in the popular imagination. And I admit again that I am in the minority. You can't deny that Star Wars has become a cultural phenomenon. I may not understand it, or buy into it, but I can't deny it. To some extent, it really re- invigorated what had become a tired concept - space-based sci-fi. (I'm sure it's no coincidence that ""Star Trek"" - which was being planned as a TV relaunch as I understand it - actually ended up appearing on the big screen not long after the amazing success of ""Star Wars."") So Star Wars changed a lot of things and created a legion of fans that lasts to this day. I can't deny any of that. And yet, I still can't bring myself to really like this movie. But since I can't deny its impact and importance - it gets a 5/10 from me.","

"neil-476","14 February 2011","I was 24 when I saw this when it first came out. I saw it on a really big screen, and it was the first film I had seen with sound so carefully constructed on a system which did justice to it. I couldn't believe the bass rumble when the Imperial destroyer appeared overhead chasing Leias' shuttle-craft, and the stereo ""whuzzh""ing of the light-sabres across the auditorium - wow! And I had been a big fan of the Lensman books in my teens, and this movie was quite obviously cut from the same cloth - this was the first time that space opera had appeared on the screen and been visually convincing. Even now I still taste that magic when I watch episode 4.Hindsight shows that the script wasn't that hot, and that the characters were fairly cardboard. But the movie is so full of great moments that I can forgive it most things.","

"AaronCapenBanner","29 August 2013","This first ""Star Wars"" film(though later sub-titled 'Episode IV') was a groundbreaking, box office shattering breath of fresh air to the cinemas, and science fiction in particular, which had gotten bogged down in bleak Dystopian futures. Nothing wrong with that in some cases, but moviegoers craved more, and got it with this extremely exciting tale of youth rebellion against an evil galactic empire led by Darth Vader(I though he was a robot at first viewing as a youngster!) a memorable creation, whose entrances were punctuated by the grand music of John Williams, who created an unforgettable score here that kids imitated endlessly! Fine cast includes Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing and Sir Alec Guiness. Climax is truly exciting, though film has a few lulls at times, this is still great fun. Directed by George Lucas.","

"gbill-74877","10 August 2019","How do you even review such a film? Hey, news flash, this was a great film, let me tell you all about it. One thing I'll say, it holds up over the years, and over repeat viewings. I loved how Lucas unfolded the story on the remote and arid planet of Tatooine, and the first half of the film is especially good, with all sorts of little things that add interest upon a re-watch.Some highlights overall:
The scene with Luke Skywalker looking out at the double sunset, contemplating his destiny, as we hear a soaring part of John Williams' soundtrack.The band and all those aliens in the Mos Eisley space port.The menace of Darth Vader, one of cinema's all-time great villains. One of the imperial guys is skeptical of the Force and says to him ""Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort..."" Vader responds ""I find your lack of faith disturbing,"" and begins choking him from a distance. And how about James Earl Jones for the voice? Perfect.That epic moment between Darth and Obi-Wan, with this line: ""You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down I will become more powerful than you could possibly imagine."" How all of this would tie into the sequels and prequels was also just brilliant.Favorite bit of humor: C-3PO misinterpreting the cries of joy from the garbage compactor and saying ""Listen to them! They're dying, R2! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough!""The second half of the film, starting with the bickering between Princess Leia and Han Solo during the rescue and from then on, gets to be a little cartoony and glossy for my taste, and to be honest I didn't think much of Hamill or Fisher's acting throughout the film ... but I feel as though I'm nitpicking, when I could have listed a lot more highlights that I almost take for granted now (the sand people, the whole concept of the Force, the character of Chewbacca, the amazing effects, Obi-Wan bamboozling the guards, the gravitas Alec Guiness and Peter Cushing bring to their parts, Luke swinging with Leia across that bridge ala true swashbuckling legends from Hollywood past, etc etc). Definitely a landmark film.","

"snoozejonc","16 July 2020","Along time and go in a galaxy far away, two droids go on an adventure amidst a rebellion against the evil galactic empire.As an 80s child, my Dad taped Star Wars and I remember it being the first film to hold my attention for the duration of the running time. When you watch it now compared to other films made around about the same time or before, you can see how Lucas created a spectacle like nothing seen since colour and sound were introduced.The story is not original but the way it's told from the perspective of R2D2 and C3PO fills me with wonderment every time. We see them move from one exotic, sci-fi fantasy location to another in an adventure not unlike like the Wizard of Oz, The Searchers or Lawrence of Arabia, but you go on this one like you've been shot out of a cannon on to the fastest rollercoaster.Performances are solid, with Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford being heroic and bantering well with Carrie Fisher. James Earl Jones' voice helped create a cinematic icon in Darth Vader, along with Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker as Peter Mayhew having a similar effect. The best performances for me come from Sir Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing who bring an air of classical British performance to an otherwise distinctly American slice of pop-culture.Special effects may seem standard compared to films made in the 21st century, but this was utterly mind blowing spectacle in its day and for quite some time afterwards. In my onion it easily holds it's own by today's standard and there is nothing in it aside from a few 70s haircuts that feels aged.These days I realise I am looking at this slightly rose-tinted when I hear some of the Lucas dialogue being delivered, but for something as fantastical and unbelievable as it should be, it takes you out of reality for two thrilling hours.As a child I longed to do heroic things and seeing the characters of Luke Skywalker and Han Solo doing them thrilled me. So much so my first childhood crush (like many in generation X) was Princess Leia and I didn't understand at the time why I kept having dreams about swinging from a rope with her holding on to me. I was involved in many a schoolyard fight over which one of us would be Han Solo. This is the film that I've had the most repeated viewings during my lifetime and now enjoy to watch it with my own children.(This is a review of the original theatrical version - not the remastered edition)","

Sure, George Lucas is a nut now, but in 1977 he created a story, characters and even lines that have been referenced and even copied again and again for over 30 years! Plus, it's just a good movie -- ask anyone.","

"olianajones","20 January 2012","STAR WARS! Just the title evokes a reaction and what follows is a series of emotions. Passion, joy, love, laughter, anticipation and excitement. A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away there was once such a thing as really good films, and Star Wars may be just about the greatest of them all. Without going into too much detail on the other films of the original trilogy, Star Wars may actually be the best of the three just because of its simplicity. Sure Empire takes it to a deeper level, but Star Wars is just the simple and relatable fable of Dorothy on her farm, wishing for a greater existence in life, however in Star Wars our Dorothy is Luke Skywalker, searching for his own purpose in life. We've all been there surely? That's what great films are made of.Star Wars starts out with a small and soon to be obsolete rebel ship being pursued by the ominous and disturbingly bad guy looking star destroyer of the evil empire! The storm troopers soon board and take control of the ship, lead by their captain in command, Darth Vader. The moment Vader steps out from the smoke, stands tall above the dead rebels and his infamous breathing begins, one can easily distinguish the fact he is the most bad-ass evil villain in the history of villainy. And he is. No doubt Vader is as bad as they come, but you instantly get the sense there is more to this guy than first appearances would give. More on that later. So Vader and his storm troopers take the Princess Leia hostage, played wonderfully by Carrie Fisher, who has sent her faithful R2-D2 and his tag along C-3PO away with the plans of destroying the death star, down to tattooine, the Sahara of the galaxy. Que Luke Skywalker, played subtly by Mark Hamill, who dreams of a bigger purpose in life. The chances of fate bring him and the two droids together and from there the film catapults young Luke into the adult world of the rebellion fighting for freedom against the empire.So many great characters to talk about in Star Wars, Han Solo takes the cake for being the best character for my money. He is cocky, smug and shows growth of character the most throughout the film. Harrison Ford created his first iconic character in the arrogant and charming space pilot, captain of the millennium falcon (another amazing creation) and best friend to wookie Chewbacca. I also really like the character of Ben Kenobi. Not only was Alec Guiness the superb choice to be cast as the character, there is so much depth and richness to the character too. Ben is just an old guy hiding in the desert of tattooine to begin with, but once he rescues Luke and they get off of tattooine with Han Solo and the gang, Ben starts opening his mouth and you really get the sense that this guy was once a really formidable Jedi, and still is to an extent. The real power of the force lies within his voice, within his wisdom and advice, which are truly inspiring, not only for Luke, but for the viewer too. Not only is Ben a great mentor and adviser, he is a bad-ass. His climatic duel with Vader is not only thrilling but also insightful, as Ben willingly sacrifices himself, realising he will pave the way for Luke to become a Jedi and save the galaxy. Awesome stuff.Special effects are also a triumph in this film. Everything from the glow of the lightsaber to the fantastic final battle of the death star at the climax of the film all come together in a crescendo of beautiful storytelling. It isn't just effects for the sake of effects, they are in aid of the story and help enhance it. Also, the score of Star Wars is truly memorable and without a doubt, the opening credit sequence of the film along with its famous score makes for a thrilling film moment every viewing.Star Wars has so many great themes involved, but as Ben realises when he surrenders himself to Vader, it is all about the bigger picture. Its about the future, its about growth and learning, coming of age and of course, Han shot first. Star Wars might just be the perfect film of all time.","

"funkyfry","4 November 2002","All-time classic of cheezy pop space battle opera.  Poorly developed characters are given life by the excellent cast, especially Ford (who rose to fame in the role) and Guinness.  Story from the Kurosawa film ""The Hidden Fortress"" is full of climaxes, but Lucas keeps the pace moving and the film never fails to entertain audiences of all ages.  The goriest of all the series (just look for severed arms and bloodtrails);  Ford is more convincingly ""hardboiled"" here than in the sequels (in the last of which, sadly, he is reduced to trading one-liners with the robot comic relief duo). A few notes on this film.  I was surprised not to see the uncredited script contributions by Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck here on IMDB.  As Lucas' more recent solo efforts show, a lot of the credit for ANY believability in the dialogue, not to mention good structure to the film, should be credited to them.  In fact, a lot of the reason this film is great has nothing to do with Lucas; it's a solid production that came in under fire, and more credit should go to Gary Kurtz than is generally given.  In fact, although you won't have much trouble finding a ""Star Wars"" fan who can tell you all about the eating habits of the Wookie (or whatever), you won't find many who even know the name of the film's producer.  Most fans agree that the first and second films (""Star Wars"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"") are far and away the best he has made, but few people have connected this fact with producer Gary Kurtz, who has been absent from Lucas' subsequent efforts. Although the second film is more polished and is much better directed, this first one is I think the true all-time classic because it's just so much fun and it has no shame in being what it is.  You don't yet see the infusion of puppets that followed Lucas' semi-merger with Jim Henson Enterprises in the 80s, you don't see fuzzy teddy bears killing professional soldiers, but you do get a princess with a really weird hairdo (all respect to Carrie Fisher for even being able to carry off the part without laughing; some of the lines she has to say are just too much), guys with laser swords fighting, and cool space battles.  That's another thing -- hasn't anyone else noticed that the cool space dogfights that were the high point of the first trilogy are totally absent from Lucas' last two Star Wars films?  The battle in Episode I was very short and unexciting, and there was no outer space battle at all in Episode II. One thing that makes the film such a classic is that it is so involved.  No matter how many times I see it, I always seem to notice some new object lying around that I can wonder about, or some nuance in the acting (which is mostly very broad, I will admit) that has implications I haven't considered. There are also some technical flaws and continuity errors that are fun to look for. One very smart move Lucas (or, more likely, Kurtz, since this looks to me like a ""frozen funds"" film for Fox) made was to involve 2 very solid British character actors:  Guinness and Peter Cushing.  These 2 anchor the movie in case the robots and guys in suits hadn't proved convincing (which they did). A lot of people don't comment on Cushing in this movie, but I think he's great here as always at implying a menace that is carefully controlled within a strong personality.  There are some interesting scenes were Vader appears to defer to Tarkin, making him the senior power in the Empire, while there is a suggestion that Vader is simply humoring Tarkin. However you break it up, though, this one is for all time.","

"arthur_tafero","10 January 2023","This is the First Star Wars; not Episode 4 or some other film that calls itself Episode 1. This is Episode 1. It is the one that was first seen at the premiere at Loews 44th Street Theater in 1977. The theater was abuzz with anticipation. And then the credits started to roll to oohs and ahs. The credits were followed by dozens of special effects never before seen on the big screen as oohs and ahs continued for the next two hours, non-stop. At the end of the film, everyone rose to give the movie a standing ovation that lasted over a minute. It was an exhilarating experience. Fascinating characters were introduced one by one, Luke, Hans Solo, Princess Leia, Obiwan Kanobi, and of course, Darth Vader. The robots were funny as well. Introducing and fleshing out two or three characters is tough enough, but this film took on at least five major characters and several minor ones. Only the second Star Wars film was superior to this one; all the others are ranked below in my book. Be sure to see it again.","

"Chrysanthepop","18 December 2011","What can I say about George Lucas's 'Star Wars' that hasn't already been said? It's one of the most authentically shot films, whether we're talking about visual effects, cinematography, sound, music, art direction and of course Lucas's direction. Perhaps this was the movie that tagged Lucas as one of the all-time greatest directors. Revisiting this movie more than twenty years later brought back a lot of memories. Obviously it has a lot of nostalgic value.More than two decades after its release, Lucas attempts to make its prequels and the consequences are disastrous. With CGI dominating sci-fi films since the late 90s, the look of Lucas's later Starwar films (movies 1,2 and 3 made in the 90's and 2000's) could not match up to the early classics. They lacked the authentic look and atmosphere and suffered from poor editing. Most of all they were so boring (lacking in energy, lacklustre story, dreadful performances etc) that they failed to engage the viewer.Coming back to the movie at hand, it is easily sci-fi action adventure at its best. It's rich in dialogue. The level of energy and tension is excellently maintained. Even the quieter scenes have you engaged with beautiful visuals and what's also amazing is how simple they are, no complex or intricate designing but at the same time very detailed.The characters are a delight. The casting is solid. Harrison Ford is charming and funny as the laidback and slightly self-centered Han. Carrie Fisher redefines bring a princess in films. Before that, princesses were cast as damsels in distress. Mark Hamill captures Luke's innocence and essence very well. Peter Mayhew, James Earl Jones, and Alec Guiness are great. Aside from the human cast who portray the characters so well, who could forget C-3PO and R2-D2 (voiced brilliantly by Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker)? I could keep going on and on but I'll leave it here to watch 'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back'. So long...","

"filipemanuelneto","28 May 2016","In this film, we see the struggle of the rebels to destroy a secret weapon of the Galactic Empire, whose great general is Darth Vader, a dark, sadistic and mysterious character. Directed and written by George Lucas, this film has the participation of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guinness and David Prowse.This film marks a before and an after in the sci fi. It's essential in this film genre, becoming, thanks to an imperishable popularity, a cinema icon, given the social and cultural importance that it has acquired over the decades. With an audience always faithful and unconditional admirers, the Star Wars saga continues to this day to impress and captivate. The actors were always excellent in their roles, the director/writer is one of the biggest sci-fi genius, the script is very good and the story has no dead moments: it's an intergalactic adventure that only stops at the end. No doubt that this film is excellent, it is a work of art. However, it seems that the latest audiences have more difficulty in enjoy this film, given the lack of the colorful and vividness of the actual computerized effects and cinematography. They have to understand that this film has been done in a given period, with all the available techniques at the time. And if they understand this well, they're more easily able to admire it. In fact, although the picture is quite different from what we are used to actually, it's still very well done. The special, visual and sound effects have always been good, and leave us amazed to think it's a movie with more than thirty years. The soundtrack is something that makes our hearts pounding. John Williams did an extraordinary job and managed to catapult himself to stardom, with great and deserved merit. I only have one bad comment to do: some of the effects and scenes, such as explosions and fire in the middle of outer space, where there is no oxygen, are scientifically impossible, and this should have been predicted by the production team before the film release. But this kind of errors are endemic in sci-fi.This film won the Oscar for Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Sound, Best Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Soundtrack, which shows the quality of the work developed here. Definitely, despite some wrinkles, this film is like a well-dressed and made up lady, looking younger than it really is.","

"Thanos_Alfie","16 August 2013","""Star Wars"" was the start of something new, something different, something extraordinary for those times. Until today ""Star Wars"" considered the best Star Wars movie of all times. Personally I liked it very much and I can compare it with the other two movies of the classic trilogy: ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"".George Lucas makes a great direction (nominated for the Oscar of Best Director in 1978) such the writing and screenplay (nominated for both for the the Oscar of Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen) and that great job seemed during the whole movie. Gary Kurtz also did an extremely good job for the Picture of the movie who is also nominated for the Oscar of Best Picture.The theme of this movie is that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) are going to save Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) from the evil Darth Vader (David Prowse) and they are also want to save the universe from the Empire's world-destroying battle-station.","

"zkonedog","11 March 2017","There was science fiction before Star Wars and science fiction afterwards. The amazing thing about this film, though, is that it presents such a simple narrative. It has drama, compelling characters, action, adventure, humor, and fantasy; every ingredient that an epic doth make.The storyline is classic ""good vs. evil"" fare. The Empire forces, commanded by the mechanically- supported Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones), wreak havoc over the galaxy, but are opposed by a rebel force led by Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and Han Solo (Harrison Ford).While recently watching this movie again, I identified three reasons why this simple little film sparked such a phenomenon:1. The storyline is just so compelling and dramatic. A sense of something epic prevails throughout the entire production.2. Whereas it too preceding show Star Trek many episodes to establish a cadre of eclectic characters, Star Wars (with the likes of Chewbacca, C3PO, & R2D2) accomplishes the feat in roughly 30 minutes.3. The overall genre-diversity of the experience. I recently screened the film with my 13-year old sister, and she enjoyed it as much as I did but for completely different (e.g. humorous, primarily) reasons. Much like ""Back To The Future"", for example, Star Wars attracts viewers from all ""walks"" of film genre.Basically, this ""first"" (depending on your point of view...!) installment in the series does a great job of establishing the important characters, laying the basis for the epic plot, and just providing some basic entertainment. Very few people will be turned off by it, as it contains seemingly something for everyone.","

"BigHands","29 December 1998","Some claim that Star Wars is nothing more than a simple morality tale that borrowed from classic mythology with good special effects.  Comments have been made about the film that it has a simple story and that the movie has simple characters.  While all of these claims may have some validity, to say that the film has no depth is unfair.  When one studies how much thought really was put in Lucas' trilogy, they should be amazed. While the film borrows from mythology, Lucas has made sure that each film has a major twist from its ancestors.  In the first film for example, Luke goes to rescue a princess, but instead she is the one that ends up saving him. Not only does the story telling have a twist on classic mythology, it has an underlying theme and many sub-themes that no other movie can match. After studying the trilogy, redemption is the theme most often explored. Every major ""good"" character in the trilogy at one time falls and then redeems himself. The ultimate redemption being Darth Vader who will be the main character in the new trilogy being developed as I type. As for the characters being simple, this seems unfair.  They are archtypes.  Characters common throughout all cultures.  Also, all the major characters have motivation for their actions unlike most good guy/bad guy movies.  The bad guys in the films are bad because of human flaws such as the struggle for power and greed.  They are not simple bad for bad's sake. Even the main villain of the trilogy becomes very human by the end of the trilogy when he redeems himself.  The film doesn't show the bad guys only as something to shoot at, but as human beings that have been lead astray.  The two trilogies are ultimately about how a human being can become a monster, and that a monster is still a human being in the end. The Star Wars trilogy has more depth than at first glance.  Though it does have spectacular effects, this is only to pull the viewer into the great story-telling.","

"The-Sarkologist","6 September 2021","I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this film yet, not that it needs any reviews, or introduction, because it is literally the definitive space action movie out there. In fact, there is very, very little that I can say about it because everybody who wants to see it has probably seen it, and those who don't want to see it, no amount of convincing is going to change their minds. However, I would feel that I would be doing this film an incredible dis-service if I didn't say anything about it, particularly since it was one of the first films that I ever saw in the cinemas, and a part of me still vaguely remembers that experience as well.I will start off by making a comment about the rehashed version that appeared before the prequel trilogy. Honestly, I personally felt that Lucas should have left it well alone - the film didn't need to be changed, and the added scenes certainly didn't need to be included. This is particularly the case with the scene where Jabba the Hut appears just before Han, Luke, and the rest before they board the Millennium Falcon for the first time. The thing is that pretty much the entire dialogue is exactly the same dialogue that occurs between Hans and Greebo, and I'm sure we all prefer the interaction between Hans and Greebo (particularly with the 'who shot first' debate).The interesting thing about Star Wars is that one could say that it is a story that is told from the perspective of the two robots, and when we watched it again the other night one of my friends suggested that this idea was borrowed from Akria Kurosawa, where in one of his films (I can't remember it off hand) the story is told from the perspective of two peasants. Actually, what is interesting is how the robots are actually being treated as such, particularly the scene where they are thrown out of the Canteena.Probably the stand out aspect of the film though has to be the special effects - not only were they revolutionary for the time, but it pretty much set a benchmark that all films afterwards had to follow. The thing is that back then there was no such thing as CGI, so not surprisingly there were an awful lot of puppets. In fact some people prefer the puppets over CGI, namely because computers do seem to have an issue making something appear alive, though I do have to admit that these days it tends to be much, much better than it was back in the late 70s. In fact, one of the reasons that the films were redone was because by the time of the prequel trilogies CGI technology had advanced incredibly.Yeah, this is literally a classic film, and while it might not seem the case, the fact that it has spawned so much is a testament in and of itself. In fact, it was the first film to experiment with merchansing - I still remember the Star Wars figures that I had as a kid, and how these days they are collectors items worth thousands. In a way this film kicked that whole craze off, to a point where merchandising can add millions to the take that a movie makes.This was a great movie. Sure, it certainly doesn't have a stand out story, and there is much better sci-fi that I have seen, but the thing is that this film, as simple as a plot may be, set the standard for so much, from special effects to merchanising, that in the end it literally changed the way that films were made.","

"Padrion","26 December 2023","Recent ripoffs like Rebel Moon once again reminded me why the original Star Wars is so damn good.It's not the special effects, which were of course mind blowing in the 70s but look very dated by now, it's the storytelling and the world building. It's the little things e.g. When Luke is playing with a space ship model or just wistfully watches the double sunset that do so much for characterization with so little effort. It's the masterfully crafted sets, be it the dusty streets of Mos Eisley or the cold corridors of the Death Star, that reveal so much more about the world than the movie is telling us vocally. It's the love and dedication that went into every aspect of this production and is sorely lacking in many modern movies.Yes, Star Wars has so far stood the test of time and still has a lot to teach to present day filmmakers.","

We felt grief for Princess Leia when she was captured by the evil Darth Vader and we all wanted a grandfather like Obi Wan Kenobi. Hell, we even wanted Chewbacca as a pet instead of a dog. This movie is a classic, hands down. Who cares if it's not your type of movie, acknowledge the fact that we're lucky a movie so wonderful like this even exists.

"sdillon-1","25 July 2003","CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERSWhat can be said about Star Wars that hasn't already been said elsewhere?
For a start, on its arrival in 1977, it was light years ahead of its time. It is a film from which cinema history can literally be divided into two epochs, kind of like BC and AD.  Pre-Star Wars cinema was a very different medium.  Post Star Wars, studios became ever more reliant on big blockbusters to remain afloat.  This has led to some truly brain dead films and, as Peter Bogdanovitch described the `juvenilisation' of cinema.  The success of Star Wars was a two-edged sword.  Its fair to say without it there would have been no Alien, Raiders of the Lost Ark, ET, Terminator, Jurassic Park, Matrix and Lord of the Rings films.  On the other hand there would also have been no Judge Dredd, Lost in Space, Planet of the Apes remake and other assorted drivel that turns up every summer clogging up the multiplexes.Star Wars (or if you're going to be a purist, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope although the subtitle was only added in the 1981 reissue) thankfully, belongs firmly in the former category.  If its legacy means we have to suffer second rate imitators from time to time, I believe it's a small price to pay for such a magnificent film.  Star Wars is an unmitigated thrill ride - a heroic, dynamic rush of pure adrenaline that has been known to make grown adults degenerate into thrill-happy eight year olds.As I have argued many times, Star Wars is not science fiction in the purest sense of the word.  It is much better described by writer/director George Lucas as `space fantasy'.  It borrows elements from fairy tales ranging from The Wizard of Oz to The Lord of the Rings.  It also is very derivative of classic westerns (such as The Searchers) as well as Samurai films like Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress.  What George Lucas did was take these elements and stick them in outer space in a way no one had done since the Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s.  He then threw in the most groundbreaking special effects revolution of all time and this is what he ended up with.The story is comparatively simple.  Young farm boy Luke Skywalker lives with his boring Uncle and Aunt on the desert planet Tatooine longing to follow in his dead father's heroic footsteps.  He gets the opportunity when two droids show up carrying a message from a Princess who has been imprisoned by the evil Darth Vader.  Luke teams up with space pirate Han Solo, his `walking carpet' sidekick Chewbacca, and his mentor Ben Kenobi (who is a former Jedi knight guided by the mysterious `Force') to rescue her.The much-maligned acting of Mark Hamill as Luke is actually often so bad its good, particularly in the Death Star scenes.  He makes a very appealing naïve hero.  Harrison Ford's career was launched on the back of his performance as dashing rogue Han Solo, and Carrie Fisher's witty performance as Princess Leia portrays her as anything but a damsel in distress. Elsewhere the droids C3PO and R2 D2 provide superb comic relief.  The banter between all the heroes is extremely funny, a factor largely (but not entirely) lacking from the current, more sombre prequels.  Gravitas is added with the scenes between Ben Kenobi (the superb Alec Guinness) and the mysterious and evil Darth Vader (wonderfully voiced by James Earl Jones). Vader is, in my opinion, the single best screen villain in cinema history. His frightening and dark presence (helped by his menacing breathing and mask) gave children everywhere nightmares.  Vader's character is not developed a huge amount in this film, but in the subsequent installments he proves the most interesting character in the entire Star Wars saga.  The other villain worthy of special mention is Peter Cushings' brilliantly nasty Grand Moff Tarkin, the arrogant governor of the Death Star.The special effects, as I've already mentioned, were light years ahead of their time in 1977.  In my opinion nothing equalled Star Wars effects wise until 1993's Jurassic Park.  Even now, the effects still look fantastic. From the unforgettable opening shot to the final exhilarating space battle, the film is a triumph.  The Death Star battle remains the best space dogfight ever put on film.  Even though we've all seen it hundreds of times, as the pilots are picked off one by one until only Luke remains we get closer and closer to the edge of our seats.  As, the odds are piled up against our hero, Han Solo's last minute intervention and Luke's triumph is, in my opinion, the second most exhilarating scene in cinema history (after the flying bike scene in ET).The production design, costumes and look of the film are terrific (with Imperial greys, whites and blacks contrasting nicely to our more colourful heroes).  The outfits spawned  millions of nerds wanting to buy full Stormtrooper regalia for ludicrous prices.  Also, the editing and ground breaking sound effects are all nothing short of landmark cinema (eg, the breathless space battles and the lightsabres respectively).  Also, John Williams' thundering music score is magnificent.  The staggeringly epic main theme, the Luke Skywalker theme, the Leia theme and many others have all become touchstones for other composers to imitate.The special edition released in 1997 made some changes to effects shots (which were OK changes on the whole) and added a new, unnecessary scene with Jabba the Hutt.  Nevertheless, it doesn't really matter which version you see, the effect is the same.The spiritual overtones in Star Wars are fascinating.  From the Christ allegory of Kenobi to Luke's choosing to have faith in `the Force' rather than trust his computer, this film is chock full of interesting interpretations about God, the Universe, and the triumph of faith, love and courage over faceless technology.  Star Wars is a reassuring film.  That more than anything I believe accounts for its success.  People may be cynical, but underneath they desperately want to believe in absolute good and absolute evil.That's why it's as timeless today as it was in 1977.","

"jboothmillard","4 March 2005","This is where it all started, the original trilogy and saga of science-fiction epic adventures, from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated writer/director/creator George Lucas. ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" the universe in ruled in fear by the Empire, and a new threat has been completed, the Death Star battle station. The rebels however have managed to capture the plans for the station, and Senator Princess Leia Organa (introducing Carrie Fisher) places them into the memory of droid R2-D2 (Kenny Baker). R2 with companion droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) escape the ship and land the desert world Tatooine, the Princess meanwhile is held captive by the Emperor's trusted servant Darth Vader (acted by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) and battle station leader Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing). R2 and 3PO meanwhile eventually end up with farm boy Luke Skywalker (introducing Mark Hamill) who lives on the planet with his Aunt and Uncle. While cleaning R2, he comes across the message from the Princess, mentioning Obi-Won Kenobi (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sir Alec Guinness), an former Jedi Knight who they find in the desert. After his relatives are killed, Luke wants to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi. They contract pilots of the Millennium Falcon, Han Solo (introducing Harrison Ford) and Wookie Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) to take them across the galaxy at light speeds. They travel to what was the Princess's planet, Alderaan, but they are pulled in by tracker beam by what destroyed it, the Death Star. After avoiding the stormtroopers, and rescuing the Princess, they eventually escape after removing the beam, but Obi-Won was killed (and became one with the Force) after being killed by his former pupil, Vader. The concluding scenes are the craft and laser battles with the Rebels and the Empire, Darth Vader escapes (giving way to the sequel), and Luke eventually blows up the Death Star (with a great explosion), and the heroes are rewarded, a happy ending.

"hamlet-16","19 September 2004","Star Wars, despite the butchering of the film in the late 90s remains a classic example of what Hollywood does best....great entertainment.Although highly derivative of just about every fairytale and comic serial, the film is so well put together that once you are on board for the ride it doesn't matter.Lucas has a very grand vision and the visual effects, whilst not quite up to 21st century digital effects certainly are effective.This film ushered in the modern era of use of sound which had languished since the early days of stereo soundtracks in the 1950s.Who can deny the impact of the opening sequence, especially in the cinema, of the starship zooming over the audience. It is one of the most brilliant beginnings to a film ever.(Even if the film unions despised not having opening titles!)It is a pity that DVD release does not have the original versions of the Star Wars trilogy. The bastardised digital updates from the late 1990s are simply not as good. Sorry Mr Lucas you are wrong to think they are better. The few extra special effects don't work and are very obvious.The new Star Wars movies simply do not have the magic of this film and its companion originals. The overuse of digital effects and the annoying JarJar simply emphasise this.But Star Wars is THE original and it is a must have in any film buff collection.","

"fernandoschiavi","16 May 2020","Long ago, in a galaxy far, far away ... This is the first line of one of the most profitable routes and revolutionary in the history of cinema.1977. A year that certainly was marked in the history of world cinema when the young filmmaker George Lucas conceived of intergalactic adventure that won a legion of fans worldwide. Earlier, the director had to his credit a few short films and a documentary series. It was there that appeared good THX 1138 (1971) and the successful comedy American Graffiti (1973) he wrote with Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck, and had in its main cast Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard (future director of blockbusters) and Paul Le Mat Both projects, especially the second, had critical success and audience, drawing the attention of Fox, which has a budget of $ 8 million dollars (much for the time), decided to fund its ambitious project, Star Wars. Mainly because of discrediting a story that talked about space, and because the director did not want to pay, taking only the merchandising rights over their work and complete freedom of creation, the project went ahead. In fact, Lucas knew what he had on hand was special and had a good chance of achieving success. And that was precisely what happened. That earned him enough money to open his own film companies. Among them is the ILM (Industrial Light & Magic), the company that revolutionized the industry with high quality special effects and technology itself.The theme of space had been treated before but with totally different approach. For example, in master Stanley Kubrick's2001: A Space Odyssey addressed other aspects more scientific, realistic and questioning, resulting in an art film, cerebral and striking, that Kubrick could almost anticipate and create your vision of the planet Earth space even before the man reach the moon years later. However, nothing can compare to the universe of action / adventure / drama and above all, fun created by Lucas. There was a movie questing, just a great entertainment with a fantastic ambiance and unlike anything that had been seen before in cinema. This pattern of creation was so innovative and impactful that several filmmakers followed the concept in their future science fiction works such as Ridley Scott, avowed fan of Star Wars, had used in his upcoming films: Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982). With Star Wasappeared a concept hitherto non-existent: the film ""blockbuster"" or ""blockbusters"", made with big budgets and they had the power to generate big box office. The studios come out and profiting course, viewers from around the world getting impressed every revolution effects. The movie changed the rules of Hollywood, bringing special effects to a level never seen before and made the studios would give more importance to young people in the cinema.Lucas conceived the plot into six parts, but saw that in 1977 would not have the technology needed to bring the first parts of the plot to the big screen. So decided to start telling the plot for the last film, with the intention of producing the first chapters of the saga years later, so they knew that the technology would be able to give all the support necessary for the completion of his dream. With the film's success and guarantee the realization of upcoming films, the first ""Star Wars"" won the subtitle ""A New Hope"" in 1981, when it was reissued.Filming took place in the Sahara desert in Tunisia for the scenes on the planet Tattoine. After that the filming went to London, where the scenes of the Death Star and the spacecraft was built. Meanwhile, in the United States, Industrial Light & Magic, a company founded by Luke, began preparing the models, miniatures and equipment to create special effects. After production problems and find the first cut and disastrous effects, Lucas took control of ILM technicians to show what he wanted in terms of action and speed to the space battle scenes. After adjustments, the Fox executives saw the movie could actually revolutionize the cinema.It's a Civil War period. The Imperial Forces -- under orders from cruel Darth Vader (David Prowse) hold Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) hostage, in their efforts to quell the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford), captain of the Millennium Falcon, work together with the companionable droid duo R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) to rescue the beautiful princess, help the Rebel Alliance, and restore freedom and justice to the Galaxy.What strikes us most is the ambiance of Star Wars, now in cities, now in desert planets, and also the most diverse beings. Some monsters are legitimate, others are humanoids. All live on their planets and often appear in the same place as the bar scene where Luke and Obi-Wan/Ben go after Han Solo and Chewbacca. We also see the common presence of droids. All that is emerging on the screen and think normally. The identification and recognition with that new universe is the main factor that makes the film so be admired today.The script shows the sources of inspiration for George Lucas, with each character from ""Star Wars"" can be easily identified with one or more archetypes several references, as in science fiction and ancient mythology. The characters are also very different and very charismatic, playing key roles in the plot. Mark Hamill, who had interests in the curriculum only series and TV movies, proved very charismatic and able to hold the weight of leading a blockbuster with much skill. With his white robe, is the juxtaposition of the black costume Drath Vader. The hero is shown as innocent at first, but with a spirit always argumentative, impulsive and personality, leaving her very interesting development. Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia, is a heroine who needs to be rescued, but beyond beauty, also shows with great personality and courage, captivating the audience. Harrison Ford as Han Solo, perhaps the most interesting character, because it has an own code of ethics and morals, as well as being selfish and conceited. However, late in the film where Solo leaves aside the design we created him a ""mercenary who only cares about money."" Even the phrase ""do not let you (Luke) get all the glory to himself"") still meets with the previous events shown throughout the film. Alec Guinness will also very much like the hermit sage. Anthony Daniels as C -3PO and Kenny Baker as R2-D2 are also super good and has a fundamental role in the plot, and the great comic relief in the midst of a war scenario. Darth Vader proved a villain really awful and striking, being crucial for feel a real threat. The characterization of Darth Vader is perfect with the costume completely black, combined with a firm and menacing voice of James Earl Jones and ending with his lightsaber red as opposed to blue saber heroes.The art direction and photography are crucial in building the world we see on screen. Photograph of Gilbert Taylor highlights colors lifeless on the planet Tatooine, giving a visual arid, which reflects the characteristic of that planet while hard life of those people constantly threatened by the empire. When the action takes place on the ship of Darth Vader, the grim picture, highlights the dark colors, which represent evil. Allied with the art direction needs to Leslie Dilley and Norman Reynolds, the scenes in space denote advanced technology scenarios in models made precisely, making it easier for the special effects team working. In one scene, when Luke and Kenobi arrive in town to negotiate with Han the use of a ship, the general plan of Luke highlights the fine work of art direction, which creates a different village, full of detail in each of its buildings. If today, some may say that the effects are exceeded, for the time was a real revolution. Fact is that the effects are impressive even today. All this careful visual appearance is impressive, from the many creatures like Jabba dangerous) to the stately ships that cut at high speed chase sequences and fights in space, marking some of the great moments of the film. Be done without major technologies, the talent and creativity of professional values the work. The art direction, the costumes and special effects were deservedly Oscar-winning.Sound also plays a key role in the strength of Star Wars. The sound effects in the fights with the lightsabers, the sound of the ships moving in space, the sounds of the robotic droids, are essential to the progress of the plot, combined with the spectacular soundtrack John Williams. Unforgettable is even a track, especially the part of the signs going up on the screen into space. No wonder that both the sound, the sound effects and soundtrack have won the Oscar for his work.The editors Richard Chew, Paul Hirsch and Marcia Lucas can also print speed all the time and not let the pace drop. The assembly also uses often fade and transition of images that overlap on the screen, giving an air of purposeful episodic narrative. A major problem of A New Hope is its closed end. Lucas Meso having a story to six chapters, it was not certain of the success of this first feature. If no other film was produced later this would have to be closed, with a beginning, middle and end. With a little slip at the end where the events seem a bit quick to quickly finalize the story, the plot is easy to understand, flexible, modern and pleasing as transports us to a fantasy world and engaging in the midst of the Civil War. A film that revolutionized and won millions of fans around the world, leaving us with very high expectations, fully rewarded with the great ""The Empire Strikes Back"" released three years later.""May the Force be with you""","

The droids crash on a desert and are saved by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and when he listens to Leia's message he becomes involved in the mission. Luke meets the man who Leia wanted the message to go, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Sir Alec Guinness), an elderly former Jedi Knight. The two team up and go to one of the roughest towns on the planet. They hire the serves of Hans Solo (Harrison Ford), and his hairy companion Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) to help them. This crew end having to go into the Death Star, and forced to save the Princess and battle the power of Darth Vader.The production history behind Star Wars actually pretty interest, and had all the makings of being a flop. It was cast with unknown actors, the budget ballooned, many of the actors did not get along, particularly Anthony Daniels and Kenny Barker, and Fox got cold feet with the film. But this was not the case, and of course Star Wars was a massive success. The first saw the film when I was 11 and it still hold power over me. The actors in the film are decent throughout, this was the role that truly brought Harrison Ford to prominent, and he is easily the best actor in the film. His character is cool and has chemistry with everyone as the smuggler who seems not to give a damn. Both David Prowser and James Earl Jones ooze power and domination as Darth Vader, Prowser as the physical performer and James Earl Jones offering a menacing voice. Of course Sir Alec Guinness was good as his role as Luke's mentor and surrogate father. Carrie Fisher had excellent chemistry with Harrison Ford having a love hate relationship in the movie. And of course Mark Hamill was good in the leading role.But despite the actors efforts, this was George Lucas achievement, having written, directed and produced the film. As the sole writer/director this is the best Lucas has ever did. Lucas throws many sci-fi fantasies into this film, space travel, giant and laser weapons, psychic powers, multiple alien creatures, and basically fun adventure and action. The action scenes are excellent thought and the special were fantastic, particularly for the time. Even now they are still amazing. This also the best script Lucas has written, whilst the adventure was grand, the focus was on interesting characters you could care about. Lucas made sure the character were well developed and the world was grand, it was obviously based on the Roman Empire.Lucas shows when Special Effect are done well with a good story it can enhance the film experience. Lucas also hired John Williams to make the score for the film, which was a wise move. Williams make one of his best scores and it his music added to film, particularly the Death March.An all important classic.","

"lostonthehighway","27 January 2022","There are over 1,022,000 words in the English language and that still isn't enough to describe the absolute brilliance of Star Wars.Unlike most people who have seen and loved Star Wars, I actually watched this film a little late - i.e. I wouldn't say it was a childhood film of mine, as it was for most people, rather, I watched it a few days ago at my current age. This was partially because I a) didn't think I'd like that kind of thing and b) because I found it to be so hyped and so talked about, it couldn't possibly be *that* good. Well, let me just say that I have never been happier to be so wrong in my life.By the way, I should probably note that what I'm saying in this review largely applies to all three films, because I love them all pretty much equally, but I'm going to write it under the original because, well, it's the original, and also (despite a very close competition), my favourite of the three.Every single facet of this film captivated me from start to finish. Not for a dingle moment did I feel its 2 hour runtime, I was always too busy staring at the set pieces... or trying not to laugh... or trying not to cry... or biting my nails in anticipation. Speaking of the set pieces, the fact that this was made all the way back in '77 is actually beyond me. The effects have held up mind-blowingly well almost fifty years later, and I honestly prefer this a thousandfold to the green screen trash we get nowadays. I can just see how much care and time was put into those beautiful practical effect spaceships and everything. I can definitely see some influences of 2001: A Space Odyssey in the effect work, and I mean that in every good way possible.Now, the plot. The story. Just. Wow. I mean - Star Wars has been referenced in popular media so much that I was pretty familiar with the series, as pretty much anyone is, even before I watched it. So I thought I had it all down. But the reality was that I was hit with such a massive... FLOOD of visual and narrative beauty that I didn't think that my tiny insignificant human mind could handle it all. And seeing all those aforementioned references finally click together and make sense...and the characters were all awesome in their own ways and the worldbuilding was incredible. It's just so original and beautiful, and the ending left me smiling from ear to ear. I didn't think that somehow you could have moments that were both hilarious and heartfelt, with drama and impeccable action scenes and beautiful FX in one movie, all while still being rated U.Writing this in 2022, I know that Star Wars has grown into a multi-million-dollar franchise, with spin-offs, prequels, sequels, side movies, books, and a hell of a fan base. I actually haven't seen anything apart from the original trilogy (at the time of writing), and one of the main reasons I want to keep it that way is that before Disney got its greedy little hands on it, these three films were basically THE science fiction films - the new, industry-changing, Big Thing that everyone was talking about. I'm a big fan of old 80's-90's science fiction (The Matrix, Blade Runner, 2001, the old Dune, etc), which is why I gravitated towards watching it in the first place. And I really do want to keep it as a perfect trilogy by not voyaging into the wider world of Star Wars. Who knows, maybe I will watch the other stuff one day, but my heart will always belong to the originals.Getting to see a film just so iconic at an age where I can genuinely appreciate its greatness was actually really nice. When the opening crawl started with its iconic yellow letters, the double sunset on Tatooine, the lightsaber fights, the Millennium Falcon, ""That's no moon"", the X-wings, C-3PO and R2-D2, Han and Leia, Luke using the Force, I could go on and on. You know it's going to be amazing when, within the first 10 minutes, you think to yourself, ""Damn, what a film"". And then continue to think that throughout the entire runtime.Honestly, I could talk about this film for hours, but in short, giving this anything less than 10 stars is a crime.-Sasha.","

"CubsandCulture","23 November 2019","A New Hope has the distinction of being the first Star Wars film and I think a lot of people overrate the film as a result. It is a wonderful film, on the whole and the Star War franchise is a cornerstone of American culture. But ANH is not without its problems. The start of the story is needlessly convoluted and overextended by about 15 minutes. There simply is not a reason-for theme, character, plot or world-to separate R2D2 and C3PO only to have them reunited 10 minutes later. Indeed the film has about 20 minutes of fat that could have been tightened up on the page. This is hardly surprising as Lucas is a weaker writer. It is not enough to ruin the film or anything but the writing is not crisp.The film's budget also leaves several sequences that feel less epic and more quaint in context of the franchise. The battle of the death star is almost laughably small in comparison to what comes after. And upon re-watch this aspect makes the film feel quite dated. Lucas direction is fairly good for him but there is a flatness to the film's classical structure that leaves much to be desire. In a lot of ways this film is a good first draft of the Star Wars formula.The film's endearing cultural power comes from the acting and the moral simplicity of the universe. Guinness and Ford aside I don't think any of the actors are great actors but they are all so earnest and committed to this story that their performances are charming despite, by way of example, Luke being whiny. This a classic good vs evil, underdogs vs overdogs, republicans vs fascists story and as escapism one can't do much better than this film. There is a comfort to seeing the Death Star go boom that few escapist films capture at this intensity. But with all things the film suffers from time moving on and this sort of moral simplicity is no longer as elegant as it once was.Overall this is a milestone in American culture that showed great promise for what was to come but that on its own is not fully satisfying. Lucas is a much better producer and ideas guy than writer and director; that most other Star Wars film's are better than this one is good evidence of that.A few words about the special edition: on the whole the special edition is a cinematic abortion. Almost all of the additions are at best superfluous. Most actively ruin the scenes they are in. However, the Jabba the Hutt scene is a neutral addition and at least ties the OT together better than the original cut.","

"ebiros2","22 November 2011","The ground breaking visuals never seen on cinema was a shock to many of us who's seen this movie for the first time. After over 30 years, it's still the best movie of its type.I didn't notice this when I first saw this movie but Ben Kenoby does mention about the ""Clone Wars"" in this episode. If this was a far reaching foresight on George Lucas' part, my hats off to him. This movie has more visceral impact compared to the CG filled episodes 1-3. It just shows that you can't beat the real thing. More I saw it, more I was in awe of all the fine details that was put into this movie. Each of the scenes were directed precisely without a flaw. George Lucas was an awesome director when he made this film. Ben Kenoby also mentions about Darth Vader who killed Luke's father - as we find out in the next episode, this was only a metaphor. The movie is both simple and complex at the same time.There's no word to describe this movie. Made on a relatively modest budget, it's still the finest movie of its kind. It shows that money is no substitute for talent.It's a miracle that we have this movie. I'd say it's one of the crowning achievements of human civilization.","

Having been captured by one of the empires most sinister agents Darth Vader, Princess Leia sets off a chain reaction that will forever change and define the galaxy...The movie that ushered in a new era for blockbusters and ground breaking special effects that brought forth a new precedence in what can be achieved in film and storytelling. At one time the highest grossing film of all time. The story, sweeping, the characters and locations memorable and what many have dubbed the greatest sci fi movie of all time.Lucas takes you on a roller coaster ride of action and adventure that had as of yet to be every experienced in film. Once again John Williams scores this movie where in this instance the soundtrack only strengthens and endears the film for legions of fans across the world, having spawned 5 sequels and with an upcoming 6th film coming out in 2015, Star Wars is simply put one of the finest gems in all of film history.","

"studioAT","11 November 2015","'The New Hope' is the one that started them all for Star Wars back in 1977. It is only due to the prequels that we see its real place within the whole saga.It's a decent enough film, ground-breaking at the time.If you're going from prequels to this one you might find the opening 30 mins a little slow, but the pace really builds after the entry of Obi Wan and never really lets up from there.I find Mark Hamill a little too meek and wooden at times but Harrison Ford more than makes up for it, stealing every scene he's in as the brilliant Han Solo. His chemistry with Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia also adds to the fun.Start at Episode 1 and work up to this smart and funny sci fi film.","

"NoDakTatum","20 October 2023","Anyone out there NOT know the story of this science fiction classic? Okay. In a nutshell, Luke (Mark Hamill) lives on a dead-end desert planet when two androids on a secret mission fall into his possession. They must get a message from Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) to a former Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). The Resistance is battling the Empire, and the Empire's main baddie Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) is looking to destroy the resistance with a giant moon-shaped ship called the Death Star that can annihilate entire planets. With the help of mercenary Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Luke and his fellow pilots try to destroy the Death Star before it can blow up a rebel base.What is in between the lacking plot summary above? State of the art (for 1977) special effects. A cast of heroes you can cheer for, and a cast of villains you want to hiss at. Funny comedy relief, and sad moments. Basically, ""Star Wars"" has everything you could hope for in a film. I was slack-jawed when I first saw the film as a kid, and it still bowled me over now. George Lucas wrote a marvelous screenplay whose magic he had not been able to capture with the prequels. In the original film, there seems to be no pressure to top one's self. The entire story is self-contained, no sequel worries that the average movie goer in 1977 needed to fret about. Looking at the original version now, some of those magical effects ain't so magical anymore, but they are still fun. Lucas' direction is great, reminiscent of the 1950's serials like Flash Gordon. His art direction and set decoration are stunning in their scope. Even John Williams' eternal musical score deserves another listen, one of the most perfect uses of music ever put on film. I cannot imagine anyone not seeing ""Star Wars"" unless you were my mother and don't like watching movies with aliens and creatures in them. This is one of the greatest movies of all time, despite its prequels and some sequels, and a film that is truly treasured by young and old alike.","

"films-22537","10 May 2020","Not a big Star Wars fan, but like everyone else I've seen the movies a few times, recently watched this again and man does it not hold up well. All of the sudo British accents and posh attitudes that some of the characters had that were quickly abandoned halfway through the movie. The worst being Carrie Fisher, it was hard to ignore and even harder to give it a pass. The movie had great timing. A few years after the Vietnam War ended and also at the tail end of the Hollywood New Wave that consisted of long artsy serious bleak films that focused on drama and character development. Suddenly here's this action-packed space adventure with robots, space ships, swords, chosen ones, ancient myths wise old men, bad guys in all black, good guys in all white, turn your brain off adventure. Looking back now it's an average movie with a lot of holes in the logic and filmmaking.","

"ShootingShark","21 August 2005","A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, an evil Empire has constructed a massive battle station called the Death Star, which can destroy an entire planet. Rebel forces, led by Princess Leia, have captured the Death Star's plans, but are being pursued by the sinister Darth Vader. Leia hides the plans inside a robot, R2-D2, who falls into the hands of Luke Skywalker, a restless farmboy stuck on a remote desert planet. Luke learns of the important plans and teams up with Obi-Wan Kenobi, an old Jedi Knight, and Han Solo, a smuggler and mercenary, to rescue the Princess and get the plans to the Rebels.It's difficult to review Star Wars objectively, for two reasons; firstly, it is undoubtedly the most successful and influential movie-making phenomenon of all time, and secondly, I was an impressionable young boy when I first saw it and instantly fell in love with it. Its genius is of course the great genius of thirty-two-year-old Lucas, who wanted to update the hair-raising science-fiction serials of the thirties he'd seen on TV with modern film techniques, and to enhance them with a profound sense of alien culture and classical mythology (he cites Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress as a key influence). The movie, despite being a very arduous and risky production, is an absolute triumph on every level, and redefined how populist movies should be made, both technically and artistically. The story seems both new and old, the characters are unique yet archetypal, the settings are wonderfully bizarre and the performances are terrific (Ford in particular). The technical realisation of the alien words is stunning, especially in the use of art-direction, unforgettable sound-effects (by Ben Burtt) and amazingly innovative use of mattes and model-shots - the movie pioneered the use of computerised motion-control for optical compositing. The credits list is a who's-who of brilliant visual effects men; John Dykstra, John Stears, Rick Baker, Doug Beswick, Richard Edlund, Dennis Muren, Ken Ralston, Bruce Logan, Bruce Nicholson, Joe Johnston, Peter Kuran, Phil Tippett, Dan O'Bannon and John Wash, to name a few. Finally, the incredibly powerful orchestral score by John Williams adds tremendous panache to the picture, sweeping along the emotions and the actions with deliriously dramatic music. That this film is a pop culture icon is undoubted - what makes it truly astonishing however is that Lucas made it on his own terms, without compromise, when everyone was advising him otherwise. The work of a true artist should always be measured in these terms. Okay, it's just a movie - but what an exceptional, original, exciting, dramatic, eye-popping, dazzling, brilliantly-made and unforgettable movie. This review is of the 1997 re-release, which features many new effects shots (mostly in the Mos Eisley sequence), a new scene with Han Solo and Jabba and a few other shots not in the original film.","

"jeremycrimsonfox","5 May 2021","Star Wars (called Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope when it was re-released a year after its sequel, The Empire Strikes Back, which had the Episode V title, hit theaters), is the first movie released in the long-running Star Wars franchise, as well as the first of what is called the original trilogy. In this movie, Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill, a boy living with his aunt and uncle on a moisture farm on the desert planet of Tatooine, has his life changed when his Uncle Owen buys two droids, C-3PO (played by Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2, two droids who are with the rebellion, and were captured by the Jawas that sold them after escaping a ship when it was attacked by a Imperial squadron led by Darth Vader (played by David Prowse voiced by James Earl Jones). After being saved by Ben Kenobi (played by Alec Guinness), and seeing his home destroyed, he goes with him on a quest to save Princess Leia (played by Carrie Fisher), meeting strange characters, and making allies with the smuggler Han Solo (played by Harrison Ford) and his faithful first mate, the Wookie Chewbacca (played by Peter Mayhew), and deliver the plans to the Death Star to the Rebellion, which Leia hid in R2.This film would begin a legendary franchise that is still ongoing, with TV shows, toys, and even comics and novels. The special effects are spectacular, even for the original version (the special edition does add more, like a CGI Jabba The Hutt for a restored scene), and the story and acting is spot on. This is a must watch.","

"dunmore_ego","3 July 2007","*Star Wars* was a revelation and a revolution. There will never be anything like it again. From its unique production values, to its pioneering special effects; it was cops and robbers, it was swords and sorcery, it was politics and romance; it was royalty and rebellion; it was car chases in space chariots and computer whizbangery from sentient trashcans. A villain in black, a hero in white, a wizard in robes, a cowboy and his trusted, naked animal friend...Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is a farmboy on the desert world of Tatooine (even though his sandy-haired complexion screams surfer dude from Palos Verdes), who dreams of piloting a fighter plane instead of working a farm. Like all young men, he has been brought up to believe murdering innocent children in war is a more romantic idiom than toiling the soil and bringing forth sustenance for humanity. I digress.His dreams might have remained as distant as Palos Verdes is from Tatooine, had he not met two robots (née droids), a sentient trashcan (R2-D2) and an acolyte of Dr. Zachary Smith (C-3PO  an interpreter fluent in 6 million languages with the unfortunate default setting on Perturbed Butler). In R2-D2's memory banks, Luke accidentally discovers a holographic cry for help from a princess (Carrie Fisher). So begins a journey which will take him to the farthest reaches of the galaxy  to him, that would be ten miles down the road to the cave of doddering Alec Guinness (as Obi-Wan Kenobi), who spins wild tales of galactic war, Imperial armies, Luke's deceased father and The Knights Who Say Jedi. At Mos Eisley spaceport, while canvassing for a clandestine captain to fly them to planet Alderaan (where the cry for help bid them go), Luke and Obi-Wan meet the most sexual character of the *Star Wars* series  no, not Han Solo  Chewbacca the Wookiee; after all, he does the whole movie without ever wearing any pants. It is during this Mos Eisley ""cantina sequence"" that *Star Wars* does its most insidious good. George Lucas unwittingly shows us a universe where aliens were neither inherently ""good"" nor ""evil"", rather co-existing in a truly ""universal"" society, where good or evil individuals populate *every* species and race. The term ""alien"" is a moot point of reference in this movie, as every being (human and otherwise) traveled extensively between worlds. (The fact that this cannot be achieved without faster-than-light travel is tangential to the point.) The common thread of these disparate organisms is their multifarious strangeness; their co-existing diversity.Ironically, the cantina sequence - which features some of the most childish, lamest face-masks and character designs - is ultimately where the movie displays its most maturity. Meanwhile, a hulking, black-clad, helmeted menace in a fruity cape and 7-inch platform boots plots to rule the galaxy, with theme music heavy and minor and an army of stormtroopers - the military equivalent of fast food (plastic-coated and unhealthy) - bringing war in the name of hokey religion.His name is Darth Vader. To three generations, Lord Vader was the blackest, meanest, most badass villain to dress like the Pope since the Pope. Years later, we would discover that Darth Vader meant ""dark father"" in Swahili, a fact which jigsawed with the puzzle pie that George carbon-scored into the *Star Wars* sequel, *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980), proving that it wasn't just  as he liked to call it  a ""space opera,"" more like a space SOAP opera. Darth and an old lady who looks like Peter Cushing kidnap the princess and tool through the galaxy in a planet-sized battle station called the Death Star, proving its awesome utility by decimating Alderaan, whereupon Obi-Wan, en route, coincidentally suffers indigestion and attributes it to mysticism rather than his ninety-year-old intestines, ""as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced."" (More like that Neimoidian calamari you ate, which was in the Millennium Falcon's fridge since before Han made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs.)(Read this full review at: www.poffysmoviemania.com/StarWarsANewHope.html)","

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","30 September 2016","Star Wars; the movie that single-handedly changed cinema, forever, in the 70s; which has become one of the most important and beloved decades in film history. This is one of those cream-of-the-crop films that really deserves its high praise in every category. From George Lucas' solid directing of a story focusing on the Dark Side and the Light, Alec Guinness' classic performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi, John Williams' classic score, and James Earl Jones' voicing of Darth Vader, the best film villain of all time: the list of classic elements goes on from there.Star Wars has been reviewed and referenced so many times now that it's essentially become a staple in modern film mythology and culture, almost a fairy tale and one that's still getting discovered by people today. Film scholars, critics and filmmakers have referred to Star Wars so many times and cited its influences from Akira Kurosawa films so much that it's virtual common knowledge among film buffs. Yet even more important for some, is that Star Wars has always had emotional power for its many viewers.George Lucas' magnum opus has changed the lives of so many viewers it's unbelievable when you think to yourself: 'it's just a movie'; but there's damn good reason why many see it as MORE than just another film. Star Wars is an experience, a story respecting the past while paving the way for newer generations for lovers of story, and the philosophy of spirituality. Star Wars respects the works of Akira Kurosawa, Frank L. Baun, J. R. R. Tolkien and Frank Herbert, and it uses those influences to make a world of its own that is still considered one of the most well-realized ones in film history. Everything here has real emotional impact and presence; from the lightsaber fights to the classic Binary sunset scene.It's films like Star Wars that gave rhyme and reason for so many of us to fall in love with cinema in the first place, and it sent out imaginations into overdrive unlike any other sci-fi/fantasy film before it. It became the proverbial film for blockbuster filmmaking, and a defining example of world-building for other writers out there to build their own worlds. Star Wars has become such a landmark in our lives that for some it's impossible to imagine a world where the film never existed in the first place. Thank goodness it does because we'd be poorer without films films as good as this one.Needless to say, historical impact and references besides, I love this film! It has lovable characters that need no introduction, John Williams' music that sends you to the galaxy far, far away and gets you FULLY invested with what's going on and gives you real feeling for what happens in each and every scene, and the scenery is gorgeous: the shots of space, Tatooine, and the Death Star; this gives the story a real heart and soul of its own from start to finish, making a perfect film.","

In this film you can see the influences from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 a space odyssey and the wizard of oz. And I also like how it doesn't set it at an exact place and time so it doesn't get outdated. And the visual effects still hold up. I should also put Im talking about the special edition not the original edition. A+","

"OMTR","18 June 2023","It is by viewing episode IV again just after the Prequel trilogy that we realize the full extent of the narrative fluidity of the dramatic arc imagined by Master George Lucas from the very beginning of his cosmic adventure, composed of an ennealogy or triple trilogy, ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...""Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi, in the twilight of his current incarnation before returning to the Force, brought his long experience and wisdom to a then-rookie group composed of Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford.His second duel with ex-Padawan Anakin Skywalker-turned-Darth Vader - played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones in the original trilogy - is the most emotionally intense scene in 'A New Hope,' especially after watching the Prequel Trilogy the days before.Last but not least, Master John Williams creates one of his most iconic themes along with 'Jaws', 'Superman' and 'Indiana Jones'...","

"g-leno","21 November 2013","There is no denying that this film was the start of something big, and you cannot take away from it the fact that it changed the face of the sci-fi genre, maybe even the whole film industry, in to what it is today. For its time, the effects, story, characters and detail in this film are are beyond exemplary. Most action and sci-fi films aim to be compared to star wars, a feat that is rare and, in my opinion, has only been achieved by Terminator 1 and 2, the lord of the rings trilogy and marvels: the avengers.A new hope works brilliantly as a first chapter to a saga, however, I feel that it works better as a stand alone film. Unlike many films that are a 'first part', it has a beginning, middle and end, tells everything that needs to be told and leaves the characters in a satisfying place. I feel that having seen the prequels does not diminish anything about this film like it does to episodes five and six.The only problem that I have is that the original theatrical release doesn't really exist anymore, you can only really get the version that has been tinkered with by Lucas to put needless CGI extras in. This is the original and best of the star wars saga, however i do feel that many people see this through rose tinted glasses and will not see any faults in any of the three original films, even though they are happy to say that the three prequels do not exist as far as they are concerned. Awesome film, great legacy, and now that Disney has the rights away from Lucas, a great future too.","

"sme_no_densetsu","25 March 2009","""Star Wars"", in case you've been living under a rock for the last thirty years, is a sci-fi action/adventure about a group of rebels trying to save the galaxy from the clutches of the evil Empire. At the time of its release it became the highest grossing film of all time. It then went on to spawn two sequels and three prequels, not to mention numerous spinoffs in various forms of media.The principle characters in the story are Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), an idealistic farmboy, Han Solo (Harrison Ford), a cocky starship pilot & Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), a feisty rebel and 'damsel in distress'. All have been assimilated into popular culture, as have numerous supporting characters like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader & Chewbacca. The cast is indeed a good one but objectivity is difficult at this point since the cast and characters are so inextricably linked.George Lucas's script does a fine job of creating an energetic story and populating it with memorable characters. His direction is well handled but the best aspects of the film's visuals come from the ground-breaking special effects. Sure, they may not be outstanding by today's standards but they were breath-taking at the time and for many years afterwards.In addition to the stellar visuals, the film also excelled on the aural front. The sound design by Ben Burtt masterfully brought the world and its creatures to life and resulted in a special achievement award from the Academy. And who can forget John Williams's legendary score, which, in 2005, was chosen as the greatest American film score of all time by the AFI.Simply put, this was a film that not only connected with millions of people but changed movie-making itself. As a result, it is a must for any film fan. That being said, I've only rated the film an 8 for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I feel that the trilogy is best appreciated as a whole and, secondly, the follow-up refined the characters and storytelling to such a degree that the original suffers slightly by comparison.By the way, if you've only seen the prequels (Episodes I thru III), don't let them dissuade you from seeing the original trilogy. The original trilogy is much, much better.Also, I recommend watching the original versions of the films, not the 'Special Editions' that Lucas messed around with for the 20th anniversary.","

"TheNorthernMonkee","22 May 2005","SPOILERS Long ago in a galaxy not so far away, former film student and up and coming director George Lucas wrote and directed a modest story about good and evil. Entitled ""Star Wars"" this film would become one of the most popular films of all time. Spawning two sequels, a selection of weak re-masterings and an often dire set of prequels, this film is the film that changed the way people looked at cinema.Raised by his aunt and uncle, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) dreams of the future. Accidentally discovering a message by a rebellion inside two droids, Luke sets off with his friend Obi Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) to save the day and help defeat the Empire and the evil Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones).From the offset, ""Star Wars"" gives indications of it's intentions. A freedom based rebellion fighting against an evil Empire, the film draws a very strong line between good and evil (a line which will eventually become blurred) and simultaneously provides us with the ultimate Science Fiction Epic.Over a quarter of a century old, this film and it's two sequels is perhaps one of the most famous and popular films of all time. Entertaining and addictive, it has some serious flaws, but we overlook them due to the feeling of child like joy that it gives us.Written and directed by creator George Lucas, this first film, second sequel ""Return of the Jedi"" and it's prequels, contains some of the worst lines you will ever encounter. As one star said to Lucas ""you can write this sh*t George, but you sure can't say it"".The problem with George Lucas is that ""Star Wars"" has always been his baby. As a result, Lucas often gives the impression that the only person to be allowed to change it should be him. Releasing remastered versions of his original trilogy, Lucas is constantly cutting and changing his original film to degrees that it is beginning to loose a lot of it's original glory.Released in the 1970s and early 80s, Lucas's original trilogy is a joy to watch because of what it is. At the time an original, well constructed film, by modern standards, the special effects are laughable. Aliens consisting of men in masks or rubber puppets, part of the beauty of the ""Star Wars"" trilogy was always it's out of date style. Unfortunately though, as the times have changed, George Lucas has released altered versions of the film with new, inappropriate, special effects and scenes which feel out of place. Lucas needs to realise that films are good because of what they are, they don't need to be constantly updated. Films like ""Battleship Potempkin"" from the 1920s were good because of their story and because of the meaning at the time. If someone was to release an edit of 'Potempkin' with colour added, a new soundtrack and brand new special effects during crucial scenes, the film would loose some of it's beauty. With ""Star Wars"" this is what Lucas has done. Adding random animals to scenes and reintroducing an edited scene starring future bad guy Jabba The Hutt, Lucas has corrupted the wonderful film he worked so hard to create.Everyone who has seen it, tends to love ""Star Wars"". Often winning polls to find the best ever films, this marvellous trilogy is a reminder to so many people of a childhood past. Sadly though, as the films get older, George Lucas refuses to let them date gracefully. Constantly rehashing and rewriting, Lucas is already responsible for an atrocious script, only to add to his crimes. The series were wonderful when they were first released, and Lucas should have kept this in mind and kept his hands off. A classic in it's own right, but it won't be if it's creator keeps on changing it.","

"sarastro7","30 May 2007","Let's all be thankful that today's computer effects did not exist when Lucas made the original Star Wars trilogy, because if they had then the original movies would have looked as bleh as the new ones. With the new trilogy, Lucas proves once and for all that he himself doesn't even understand what was good about the original movies. The original Star Wars movies are cool because they create a convincing, alien culture. Everything looks used, rugged and thousands of years old! It's believable as the surroundings of a five-thousand year-old and truly alien culture. It creates a timeless impression.The new movies, on the other hand, are nothing but run-of-the-mill ""hot right now"" special effects which will look dated in a couple of years. The look they achieve is generic futurism as we always imagine it, all sleek, silvered and aero-dynamic, all devoid of imagination. Fie on it, I say!!The new trilogy does not deseve to exist. Lucas you fiend, how much did Hollywood pay you to kill your imagination?!","

"bleakeye","5 August 2001","""Star Wars"" is perhaps the most successful movie franchise of the 20th century.  From movie ticket sales alone, it has made George Lucas a very wealthy man.  Add the toys, games, t-shirts and other merchandise and it should establish Lucas as part of history.  A person has just got to start wondering how this movie ever become so incredibly profitable.  Although this movie is watchable and even innovative, I really cannot put ""Star Wars"" in the same categories as impressionable films like ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Stagecoach"", ""Casablanca"", ""The Bridge On The River Kwai"" and even ""Pulp Fiction"".My reason for saying that pertains to one factor, director George Lucas. Although many would argue, I think that Lucas is not a good director.  He always seems to be lacking focus with Star Wars' story, in which was almost the case with ""American Graffiti"" (Thankfully, he didn't).  I'm very impressed with the innovative visual effects of ""Star Wars"" as I am with any film afterwards that ever utilized it justifiably in connection with the certain film's story (it's sequel, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is much better in many aspects).  Unfortunately, outside of it's visual delights, it just doesn't have anything that other films hadn't already shown (even if this was made for children).  From the whole ""boy leaves home"" beginning (Mickey Rooney has done it before with more feeling) to it's much appreciated ""bar room scene"" (straight out of many westerns and even some war themed films), there isn't anything we haven't seen before.  Although the whole galactic twist on which the movie is based is totally original, majority of the ideas are still pretty much re-hashed from greater films (Kurosawa's ""Hidden Fortress"", Errol Flynn/Michael Curtiz movies, etc.).  To re-evaluate, the bad parts consists of lack of originality.  The idea's, topic's and situations' originality in which a film's greatness lies are sadly missing.  The good parts which are visual design in terms of special effects and costumes definitely proves it's place in being a great landmark picture.  I just don't recognize it as the one of the greats.  This reaction could be the result of years of watching movies again and again and unexpectedly realizing a certain film's depth and lasting capabilities.  A good, not great movie full of innovation yet lacking any depth that is only realized when seen again.","

"Anonymous_Maxine","15 June 2002","The problem with reviewing a film like Star Wars is that it has been scrutinized and analyzed and poked and prodded for decades, which leaves little left to be said about it that has not been said already (and, consequently, probably means that virtually no one will read my review of it!). The thing that allows Star Wars to really get under your skin and have such a powerful and lasting effect on you lies in the combination of its simplicity and complexity. It is no secret that the vast majority of film plots revolve around some version of the ancient `good vs. evil' storytelling structure, and Episode IV is probably the most widely given example of this. The original Star Wars is a shockingly simple presentation of this structure, but it is also an immensely enlarged version of it. Lucas uses good vs. evil to structure his plot, but at the same time, he adds a story that entails such a level of complexity that it is impossible to reduce the film to a tired exercise of an age-old story structure.George Lucas's superhuman visual imagination is one of the things that plays the largest role in making the original Star Wars film such a joy to watch. Every single scene is packed with visual curiosities that fascinate the viewer time after time, making the re-watch value nearly endless. Lucas is able to walk the fine line between using visual effects to carry his story and using them to enhance it, and this is an even stronger testament to the quality of the film, because the special effects, while obviously not the most technologically advanced in the world, are far superior to the complexity of the story, at least on a structural level. The thing that really counts against the newer Star Wars films - rather ironically, as it were - is that they replace the physically creative genius of these earlier films by simply creating everything through computer generated images, making the effects slightly more lifelike but immensely less realistic. A cartoon is more lifelike than a hand-puppet, but not more realistic by any stretch of the imagination.The old Star Wars films are the happy home of Lucas' extinct belief that less is more, and we can see this in the tremendous amount of material that is discussed but never seen on screen, because it doesn't need to be. Lucas understood how powerful an effect he could create by having Obi Wan Kenobi give the young Luke Skywalker a brief description of what the Force is, and then use it to influence the weak mind of an Imperial Storm Trooper (`We don't need to see his identification. These aren't the droids we're looking for.'). This is great stuff, and there's not a single CGI effect in the film necessary to create it.Consider, also, the extent of creativity involved in the making of the human portion of the film. We don't just see good guys and bad guys, but entire governments created with uniforms and even wildly elaborate outfits for their dark leaders (Darth Vader is, undoubtedly, one of the most recognizable figures in film history). This is an extremely well-presented hierarchy of characters, but it goes beyond just the leaders to include lower levels, all the way down to the scum of the run-down trade cities, as well as other characters such as the infantry-level Storm Troopers, who always seem to travel around in amusing little idiot packs, no doubt chanting `We are the moron brothers' to themselves and each other all the while. It's amazing that the Imperial Forces have managed to become so immensely powerful when their most basic watchmen are such boneheads. Didn't Lord Vader notice how pathetically weak-minded all of his troopers were? Obi Wan sure did!Harrison Ford fits perfectly into the film as the greedy Han Solo, a character who is so one-sided that Ford has recently revealed that he has no interest in ever playing him again, which is too bad because there are sure to be a lot of interesting things that he could contribute to Episode III. Mark Hamill delivers a brilliant performance as Luke Skywalker, who has nearly as much charisma and charm as Norman Bates, without all that stuff about his mother. Carrie Fisher is spectacular as Princess Leah, although unfortunately so spectacular that her role in the early Star Wars films has immensely overshadowed the rest of her sadly dismissible career as an actor. She and Mark Hamill were both, in fact, horribly insulted by their roles in the latest idiot film from Kevin Smith, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. The title makes it immediately clear that the movie is to be largely a parody of the Star Wars films (specifically the older ones), and the parody that is made in that film makes it very clear that some people (Kevin Smith) haven't sense enough to respect such tremendously successful and brilliant movies like the old Star Wars films, but rather know only to try to feed and capitalize off of them, regardless of how low they have to sink to do it.It's sad that movies come out these days that are so insulting to old classics, and that this almost always happens in spoof films, which always have the potential to be tremendously hilarious and entertaining films, but they rarely do. I hope that someone with some power in Hollywood will notice that the spoof films that blatantly exploit the films they are parodying in order to get some cheap laughs are unequivocally the awful ones (Jay and Silent Bob, Scary Movie 1 and especially 2, etc.). I wish it wasn't so hard for them to see that films that poke fun respectably, like Spaceballs or even Wrongfully Accused, to some extent, are always the ones that generate the most satisfying laughs, and retain the most staying power.
Regardless of how the spoofs deliver moronic parodies of the original Star Wars films, however, they continue to stand as some of the greatest science fiction films of all time, and they remain that way even compared to their computer aided descendents. It is a testament to any kind of movie when it can stand up to nearly endless childish parodies as well as to theoretically improved versions of itself and extensions of its story, and still remain as powerful and moving as it was on the day it was released.","

"ja_kitty_71","3 February 2010","I had gotten curious about the ""Star Wars"" saga. But I had bought the DVD collector's box-sets of both the original and the new prequel film trilogies. And after that, I love the ""Star Wars"" saga.""...In a galaxy far, far away... "" The evil Galactic Empire rules the galaxy with an iron fist. Having the plans for the empire's deadly weapon the ""Death Star"" space station, Princess Leia of the planet Alderaan hid them (as well as a distress message) in a droid (robot) called R2D2, when her ship was attacked by Darth Vadar. Luckily, R2 and another droid named C3PO escape with the plans to a desert planet called Tatooine.There the two droids got captured by creatures called Jawas, and sold to a moisture farmer named Owen and his nephew Luke Skywalker. Upon cleaning R2, Luke found Princess Leia's distress message; but it malfunctioned. The message was for a Obi-wan Kenobi, of course to Luke, it must be old Ben Kenobi who lives in the hills. That night, Luke discovered that R2 was gone! He and 3PO went out to look for him. Sure enough, they found R2, who was looking for Obi-wan. But they are in the territory of the dreaded Sand People! Luke and 3PO got attacked by them and little R2 hid. But luckily they were save by a cloaked figure, who happens to by Obi-wan. Obi led the three to his place and played the distress message. Obi-wan then tell Luke about the situation and about the Jedi Knights, that were wiped out long ago; then he asks Luke to come with him to Alderaan. But Luke wants out of it, on the count that he would be in big trouble from his uncle. But Storm-troopers that were looking for the droids, attacked and killed his uncle and aunt. So Luke eventually joins Obi-wan. They enlisted the aid of a smuggler called Han Solo and his Wookie mate Chewbacca, and their ship to save Princess Leia. That's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends.So I really love this film and I don't have any particular scene. Also I love the musical soundtrack by John Williams was excellent.","

"markovd111","4 February 2024","Here's the thing. Watching this movie nowadays and comparing it to current standards, you will find a movie which has an overly long beginning, a lot of illogical stuff in it's plot and you won't be able to help yourself not to think how silly and clunky it all looks. If you want to criticize this movie, you will find stuff to criticize, I assure you. And let's not even talk about that whole special editions drama.But... If you look under the hood... Then, you will see the passion and love behind it. An enormous imagination and determination from it's creator, George Lucas, is simply flowing through every pore of this movie. And now remember that all of this was made in 70-s, with a limited budget (that was mostly spent on stuff that was never used in the movie) and technology, a lot of problems during shooting, publishers that didn't believe in the project and you will understand why this movie is so important and why you cannot be objective to it. There was nothing like this when this came out, and in some ways, there is nothing like this all these years later. It's a magical experience and I can only imagine how amazing it was to grow up with this movie and it's sequels. There's not a lot more one can say here. If you don't like this movie and the Star Wars franchise as a whole, there is nothing I can tell you here that will change your mind. If you do like it, then you know what I'm talking about. 10/10! I recommend it to everyone! There's a beautiful story to be experienced here!","

After starting this re-watch the Star Wars franchise, my viewpoint has completely changed. This movie is humble and simple. The pacing is superb, with each successive scene adding to the narrative and progressively getting better and better.The heroes are not perfect, in fact they have notable fatal flaws. These weaknesses make them more relatable and help me care about what happens to them. Not only are the characters compelling individually, but their chemistry together is outstanding.Is it the best Star Wars movie? Time will tell as I complete my re-watch. That being said, ""A New Hope"" is excellent cinema and a great introduction to the Star Wars universe.Additional Note: I get chills every time the scene cuts to Obi Wan walking around the Death Star.","

"deepfrieddodo","22 April 2023","The first steps of a juggernaut that holds the greatest significance to the Sci-Fi genre. In terms of legacy, Star Wars (Episode IV - A New Hope) is utterly perfect, important to cinema and the beginning of a franchise still flourishing half a century later.So much content is created in the dialogue, laying a background for a film as standalone, with throwaway lines on characters, planets, events and species, but giving a wealth of plotlines to be exploited decades in the future.The film itself is brilliant due to the imagination of it's creation. Lucas fabricated a galaxy filled with a unique and wonderful history, interweaving and interacting, yet so simple when alone that the plot can be understood instantly. A story of good and evil, led by strong personalities, with a healthy dose of action and excitement to keep the swift plot moving along.Visually so nostalgic, yet seemingly cutting edge at the time, props, costuming, and arguably most importantly, puppetry are all outstanding. Leaning on the Wild West in parts, then jumping to the Space Age, the range applied provides such colour and movement in every new setting. The infamous additions made by Lucas around the turn of the millennium are unwelcome, with poor CGI poorly integrating into the original film, but this goes to show that the physical discipline that went into creating these sets are second-to-none.Casting is perfect - relative unknowns mixed in with theatrically training actors, all flawlessly suited to their characters. They are supplemented with droids with distinct personalities, providing flavour and comic relief at the right moments, giving a full roster of fan favourites.There are imperfections; some later corrected in subsequent iterations, such as the translucency of Vader's eyes in his helmet, showing a lack of sinister-ism in the person beneath, but these are minute in the grand scheme of things. Elements are befitting of the 1970s, but this is both a benefit as much as any slight drawbacks. Nothing lessens the impact of the story.Supported by possibly the greatest soundtrack ever, Star Wars continues to inspire and entertain new generations, as one of the most famous films ever released develops long after enthralling it's first audiences.","

"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","25 May 2022","When I was a kid back at the early 2000's when episode II Attack of the Clones came out, I remember renting A New Hope and Return of the Jedi on video tapes. This movie did had disturbing moments, but in later years I didn't get bothered by them anymore. And with all honesty, this is what got me into the franchise as a whole.The story is a very great concept and it was executed very well. It introduced the original characters we all know and love especially Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Ben Kenobi, and Darth Vader. Not only do the main characters have their compelling arcs, but it shows Ben Kenobi's connection to Darth Vader. The two droids C3PO and R2-D2 (who were introduced in the prequels) played by Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker are good side characters that share some funny moments. The acting from everyone is great with Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alex Guiness, and James Earl Jones giving superb performances.Everything else is done well. The action sequences are thrilling, the pacing is very brisk, the visual scenery is gorgeous and beautiful, the directing is top notch, and John Williams music score fits the movie very well with one of the best movie themes of all time especially with the opening crawl letters which sets the mood and premise flawlessly.Overall, Star Wars (AKA: Episode IV: A New Hope) is a great start to a good trilogy and it still holds up after 45 years.

"alindsayal","12 December 2021","With The Mandalorian set to hit the UK next week and with myself being one of the people in isolation at the moment I have decided to rewatch the Star Wars films and possibly the shows in order to catch up and I have now rewatched the first Star Wars Film A New Hope and this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a farmer join forces with a Jedi Knight, a cocky pilot, a wookie and a pair of droids in order to attempt to save a princess from the evil Empire.Main Character
Mark Hamill became an actor that was type cast in the role of Luke Skywalker and this was the start of his journey as the character. Luke is a character it is quite easy to root for as he is like us, learning about these big galactic events like us the audience, he doesn't start as a big confident character but he wants to do the right thing and we can relate to that as if given the opportunity we want to be the hero of the story.Supporting Characters
This is a part of the film where it really succeeds, Harrison Ford plays Han Solo in this film and he is easily the best character in this film. He is cocky and arrogant but he is so entertaining to watch in the film that you care about his character, his character also has the best arc in the film and he really develops as the film progresses. Carrie Fisher plays Princess Leia and judging by the premise of the film you would believe she is just the damsel in distress but she really isn't, she gives the other characters attitude and doesn't take nonsense from the other characters and shows her character has plenty of strength to her as a leader of The Rebellion. Alec Guiness plays Ben Kenobi and his role is crucial in the film, he really plays a mentor to Luke in the film and sets him on his way as a character on the journey that he goes for in this film. Darth Vader is possibly the most important villain in film history and this is the first time we see the character and he is possibly the most terrifying looking character on film. You don't get all the details about his character but it really gives you enough to get invested in the background of his character and the powers that he possesses.Story
Again when you read the premsie of the plot of the film you probably think it is really basic and I guess it kind of is but it is executed so fantastically that it rises above the basic idea of the and makes it extremely interesting. Learning about the things such as the Jedi, The Empire & The Rebellion that keeps you intrigued and just sucks you into want to learn more about this situation and the characters. If any film can get away with being a bit predictable it is Star Wars as it feels perfect for the film you are watching and sets up all these characters for great arcs in the future.Script
The script for this film is great, it has some truly memorable lines that are remembered by fans and casuals alike. There are some funny lines that make the characters seem more interesting and likeable, plus the drama builds to some real emotional moments thatrises this film above other films in the same genre.Style
This film came out in the late 1970's and it looks incredible, the action scenes are some of the most exciting and entertaining of all time and they keep you on the edge of your seat whether it is a blaster battle, lightsaber battle or space battle it is great. I also have to mention how important John Williams score is to this film as it makes every scene feel so much bigger then it is and it makes this such a better experience. The one thing I must mention is that I watched the current edition of this film that has some added scenes with new CGI but in this film I just find these really jarring and don't think they add to the film at all and even look uncomplete. However, I felt that these scenes are few and far apart and don't take much away from the overall quality of the film.Overall
Overall this is one of the most revolutionary films of all time, it is a pretty perfect start to a franchise and sets up all the characters superbly for future films while providing a great film in it's own right. If you are one of the few people that haven't seen this film then watch it as soon as possible.Rating - 10/10.","

"jpschapira","13 May 2005","I can't say anything about George Lucas coming directly from my opinion. I have never (maybe) seen any of his work; It's not interesting for me. I don't hate science fiction and futuristic films (because that's why he's known), it's just that those are not my types of movies. Anyway, I know some people that say he's great. He made ""Star Wars"" thinking he would make a trilogy, this was number 4, then he did 5 and 6; he probably thought it was over, but some years later he showed us the beginning of something we had already known the ending with ""Episode I"" and ""Episode II"". What happens before this film, departures from a movie that has not been released yet: that's ""Episode III"".There's a time (now) where the special effects are ""show ups"". I like to think there was a time when they were used to serve the story; for sake of entertainment. Now, plots are merely complex, but effects are totally outstanding. ""Hero"" was lauded by critics, but it was just the visuals for me; beautiful visuals, of course. Then the plotThat's why I'm thinking of passing by ""House of Flying Daggers"": same actors, same directorNo, thanks.Well, special effects weren't remarkable in ""Star Wars"", but they were definitely the best they had at that time. I didn't care about them, anyway, because Lucas has fun creating his own world of adventure, fantasy and whatever you want so say; but it was fun! What can you expect of some big letters flying in space that say: ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away""? The thing is Lucas' whole team worked their asses to develop this fantasy full of pleasure, and gave us the costumes, the sceneries, the charactersUnique stuff!I wasn't alive at the time the movie was the phenomenon it was, and still is; but it's a thoroughly enjoyable ride that everyone should take the chance to experience. Getting out of TV, and very young, Mark Hamill looks natural as Luke. He seems very promising in his role; the role that assured his career's ""take-off"". Alec Guiness passed away some years ago, with the Oscar in his merits, and the recognition for his performances; including his classy and for always remembered Obi-Wan Kenobi. In this film specifically, Carrie Fisher wasn't much used and not as pretty as her character should be. However, intelligent enough to provide the qualities that launch a career. One paragraph should be dedicated to Mr. Harrison Ford. I heard he wouldn't have a career if it wasn't for George Lucas. The whole story I won't say, but I'm glad Lucas discovered some of the genius in Ford. Lucas gave Ford the character of Han Solo that would bring Indiana Jones after the trilogy. After Indiana Jones, Ford's career would be irregular, with some little peaks. But here, hereFord is magical. Incredibly natural and very good""Star Wars"" is one of those movies that make you be supportive with the characters. We want their good, we want to join them in their journey and watch them survive; even when we already know what's going to happen. Excellent performances by Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca and Kenny Baker as R2-D2: considering they hadn't got much to do but they were important They were funny and an excellently teamed up for their rolesThe ending announces a sequel; filled up with happy images, simple shots and that wonderful music by the amazing John Williams; who hasn't been more than five years without being nominated for the Academy Awards (he won it for this one). All of this, of course, all of this wouldn't exist without George Lucas' mind (he'll be remembered for this!). How he did it is a long story hidden behind one of the most fascinating cinematographic experiences of all time.","

"saadanathan","14 May 2020","A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away: the most greatest saga in the history of cinema ever made started. Back in 1977, George Lucas came up with this amazing idea of a new franchise. Some may say he was among the first to bring the post modernization to the big screen. I remember watching this film for the first time when I was five and it was epic. The characters were amazing, the visual effects were great, and the whole plot which is so original is god damn perfect. George Lucas brought so many genres into this film that it's amazing how it doesn't mess things up and keeps the story simple, intimidating and interesting. It's like combining so many colors until you come up with a new color. And of course in this film we are introduced to the most famous and terrifying villain of all time - Darth Vader! And we are introduced to two of the more famous droids in star wars ever - C - 3PO and R2D2. This movie definitely marks the beginning of star wars, which later becomes the most famous saga in cinema history.","

"chera_khalid","4 October 2023","Star Wars (1977) is a timeless galactic epic that catapults audiences into a universe of boundless imagination. The acting, led by Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker and Harrison Ford's iconic Han Solo, embodies the spirit of adventure with a perfect blend of charisma and authenticity. The film editing, ahead of its time, weaves together space battles and lightsaber duels with a rhythmic finesse that keeps the pulse racing. Its strength lies in George Lucas' visionary storytelling, introducing us to a galaxy far, far away that feels remarkably close to the heart. While some may point to the occasional cheesy dialogue as a weakness, it's part of the film's charm, a nod to its space-fantasy roots. John Williams' score is a symphony of heroism, lifting the narrative to legendary heights. The message of hope, courage, and the battle between good and evil resonates as strongly today as it did in 1977. With a beloved cast, groundbreaking special effects, and a universe that continues to capture our collective imagination, Star Wars secures its place with an 8/10. It's not just a movie; it's a force that binds generations together in the journey of cinematic magic.","

The fact that Lucas was able to snare some big names (such as Alec Guiness, Harrison Ford (a rising star) and Carrie Fisher) attests to his salesmanship of the script. His execution of the script is flawless and the result is a triumph. Its success has led to further films in the series and I can't wait for the next one.","

I have to say #4 isn't my favorite of the films, but it is the one that started the greatest sci fi epic ever. I think for it's time the special effects were magnificent. And the acting was done by REAL actors from back in the day. Now a days all I seem to see coming up in the thespian ranks are pretty boys and girls with fake boobs. What happened. Anyways, i think everyone should watch this movie at least once. If your not ""enlightened"" by it you'll at least be entertained by a few good humor spots.","

"emm","9 May 1999","A long, long time ago, I was never familiar with STAR WARS until this familiar sound of music played on the radio. Later, visions of action figures on TV commercials dominated my Saturday mornings. This sure was a completely giant success story that even I couldn't understand way back in my pre-school years, but it was just happening. It took years of waiting experience to get a new VCR, and I finally took advantage of the Force. If you were like me, your early childhood days have been rough because you never got to see the STAR WARS trilogy. Fascinated by flying spaceships, bold warriors, and especially C-3PO and R2-D2, the days were a joy to behold. George Lucas' sci-fi epic that includes this first original movie is a timeless treasure, thanks to his establishment of a fantasy adventure that goes galactic. He's not just an ordinary director, but a director of technology. The excitement of its epic combat battles are worth infinite viewings, and was destined to blow away the audience with a rapid-fire force of impact. And this revolutionary piece led to numerous imitators!You can very well remember how George Lucas and the whole ILM gang made this trilogy through its history of complications. The original STAR WARS was a terrible undertaking for Lucas because he wanted a movie that feels true to realistic. When JAWS was playing in 1975, it showed off some new special effects technology of a great white shark, and managed to achieve in editing. That hit film was released at a time when production values remained tight, which they were often called ""B"" movies. STAR WARS has been the same thing, and it wasn't exactly clear that high-quality visuals would ever be possible. It would take more than the entire National Football League to create a 70s masterpiece. Lucas tried, and won by displaying a thrilling speed of action with a lightning fast pace. One example is the brief ""hyperwarp"" scene, where one blink of an eye ruins your day. When you have an incredible view of the fireworks, there's always a big plot to make more excitement. Like the movies themselves, one good story leads to another.Without characters, there wouldn't be a movie at all. Make them appealing and then everyone can enjoy the fun. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) lives the adventure; Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is always the bold type; Chewbacca The Wookiee adds to the chemistry with his furry appearance; likeable droids C-3PO and R2-D2 are loved by the kids. But there's always the villain, Darth Vader whose familiarity would still be hated through fun, but always recognizable. This first installment actually serves as an introductory platform for the characters and their potential of things to come. We know them well, but this is only the beginning (in Episode four!). Keep in mind, though, that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has always been the central hero of the series. Pretty fascinating!Always take notice of the 1997 Special Edition. This is a mandatory must for STAR WARS newcomers who still haven't taken advantage of the Force in all these years. The myth is that there aren't a whole lot of changes. The truth is that they're saying quite a lot because the editing of these enhancements is phenomenal, and hasn't been done before. It's a remarkable achievement in modern film technology, and the scene with Jabba The Hut explains why. Remember that some of original pieces of footage remain the same with a certainty of noticeable glitches, which is still a minor offense. Add to this some incredible restoration and we still have a sci-fi gem that will stick around longer while the new trilogy slowly builds on. Think of this, you're watching an entirely new movie!I hope this original movie and the whole trilogy in itself doesn't fall victim to a terrible amount of backlash when EPISODE ONE arrives. That one will do excellent business based on our cravings for special effects; they actually sell the movies! Should it happen, this would be a fatal blow to preserving a quality image to American cinema, past or present. We must take for granted that movies are essential as entertainment, and how the many possibilities can be discovered. Judging a movie's popularity against the odds is only going to hurt it. It is currently being demonstrated with E.T. (1982) and TITANIC (1997), two highly acclaimed films that are receiving tons of negative criticism and scrutiny from the public. They do this by pushing popularity off the wall. At least we know how to handle STAR WARS movies carefully, and while we enjoy science fiction as a make-believe cushion, it's important to know that it took a genius like George Lucas to create a universe where excitement exceeds the imaginable. Without him, the movie industry would be in deep space beyond the far reaches of our galaxy. The greatest movie ever made? Only on a cult level; it is the best one for the crowd, but consider this a fine American piece of movie art for all.The Force will be with us.....always.","

"whizkids","25 September 2004","OK, this was a pretty good movie with some pretty good effects (just make sure you don't overwatch it, or you'll get bored with it).The idea for Star Wars is pretty good. I loved the character of Darth Vader. I'm not saying I'm rooting for the bad guys, I'm saying that the idea of Vader is an interesting idea. I mean, think about it. The Jedi order is abolished, and the only one who is allowed to use the Force is the Sith (the dark side of the Force). My favorite characters are Han Solo, Chewbacca and R2-D2. I like Luke too, but I don't think he became a real big big favorite until ROTJ. I also enjoyed Obi-Wan Kenobi. The effects are fantastic, especially for its time. The aliens are interesting, the bad guys are well-done (though how humans came to be the dominant species is a little surprising. Sorry, but compared to some of the other beings I saw in the Star Wars universe, it's a little surprising). I love the lightsabers and just about everything about this movie. The only problem I have is with the Force, as pretty much all Christians do. But we're able to draw enough Christian elements out of it to tolerate it.humor, action, and a lot of tension with Solo and Leia, very, very good. I don't know if it deserved the standing ovations it got in the theaters, but still great. A new hope indeed!","

"BomageMinimart","2 October 2004","I just got the box set of the first 3 Star Wars movies, only to discover that it contains A New Hope, not Star Wars...for those who don't understand the distinction, Star Wars is the film that was released in 1977, capturing the hearts, minds, and dollars of movie-goers everywhere. A New Hope if the crap that Lucasfilm released in the late 90s that includes really poorly done CGI and new scenes, many of which contradict things that we've previously seen in the film (just why was that bounty hunter looking for Han Solo? for Jabba? Jabba finds Han in the very next scene... dumb dumb dumb).Star Wars was great, and if i could buy that I would watch it a thousand times. As it is, Lucasfilm ripped me off for another $43. I'd donate it to some orphanage or something, only i prefer to just throw trash away. Congratulations, Lucasfilm, on tricking me out of my money. It's the last you'll ever get. From here on out, I'm done with yer products, even the non-Star Wars ones. This paying customer says ""c ya"".BoOh, btw... The Phantom Edit is what Phantom Menace could have been, and even it can't overcome the bad story, bad cinematography, and atrocious acting.","

So basically if i had to sum up my childhood in two words it would be star wars. From the cantina scene to the death star first rate special effects. The opening crawl probably still brings a tear to my eye. Han solo just rocked and Luke skywalker was just adorable. I love the scene in the garbage chute, but my all time favorite scene is when Luke goes outside and looks out to the horizon (the famous shot of the two suns) and the classic music cues up.

"SquigglyCrunch","2 January 2016","I was raised on all six Star Wars movies, and due to the recent release of Star Wars VII I felt the need to re-watch the series. My opinion of this movie has remained generally unchanged. The plot of A New Hope is, although not particularly original by today's standards, still a good one. The galaxy is ruled by an evil empire and a rebellion forms. I actually never knew why the rebels fought the empire when I watched it as a kid, nor did I know what a rebel was. So the plot didn't feel old or boring to me. The characters were decent, but once again, not horribly original by today's standards. I still found that they were just as likable as I remember them. Star Wars as a series is one that, although did great when it first came out, doesn't stand up to that nearly as well by today's standards. Reason being this series set the standards, so we've seen so much of Star Wars already in modern science fiction movies. The series does not age well, but when you think about it from the perspective of when it first came out it really is quite a good series. Overall A New Hope is a solid addition to the science fiction genre, and one of it's most important contributions. Despite not aging very well, it manages to hold up as a classic that I will never forget, and I think it will hold a special place in every person's heart who watched it when it first came out (or as children like me). In the end I would recommend that everyone give Star Wars a watch. Whether you like it or not is not important, but you just need to see it if you haven't already.","

So on opening day my brother and I got in line at Tinseltown 290 in Houston to buy four tickets. Standing behind me is a Cinemark employee dressed as Darth Vader. I don't know why I laughed at that moment. We originally wanted the 10:45pm showing but it was sold out and they added an extra showing at 1am. So at 1am myself, my brother, our Dad and our aunt went to see it. The lights went out and some guy behind us yelled ""Chewie!"". You those familiar drums then the Fox logo. Then Lucas Film Ltd the people applauded. Then ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away."" There was silence for that. Then the ""Star Wars"" came on the screen the theater applauded loudly. It was great. My brother and I agree George Lucas is a genius. Such imagination. He deserved that AFI Life Acchievment Award this year.

"TheVictoriousV","9 January 2019","This one's a Must-see!How could I possibly review what has got to be the one film that every human who's ever lived already knows everything about? How could I bring anything new to the table that hasn't been said already? How could I do this film justice?Firstly, I was actually introduced to Star Wars via the FanFilms (Ryan vs. Dorkman; The Empire Strikes Backyard; Pink Five; Broken Allegiance; you name it) my father always used to watch. I thought it looked cool, inventive and exciting as all hell, so I asked him if there was more. And thus he showed me his treasured VHS copies of the original trilogy in their original form. I mean it. No needlessly enhanced effects. No pointless digital additions. No Greedo shooting first. Just Star Wars. Pure, simple, untarnished Star Wars.I saw Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, a young man who lived with his aunt & uncle on the desert planet of Tatooine, as he encountered the two droids C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) who came bearing a holographic message from the beautiful Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), kidnapped by the evil Empire that ruled their galaxy. I watched as her distressed message lead Luke and the droids to the home of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), a wise old man hidden on Tatooine under the alias of ""Ben"" and a former Jedi Knight. I stared at the TV screen as Obi-Wan told Luke about the now extinct Jedi Order, how they would fight evil using the mystical ""Force"" and how he once fought the Empire alongside Anakin; fellow Jedi and Luke's long dead father. I saw Luke as he bemusedly activated his lightsaber for the first time.I also remember meeting all the great additional characters. Harrison Ford's legendary badass Han Solo I grew to like almost instantly, even if my limited English skills at the time made me unable to understand all of his smarmy snarks. His relentlessly hairy Wookie co-pilot Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) I also enjoyed. But I think we all know whom it is that everyone who's even so much as heard of Star Wars remembers the most: Darth Vader. He could use The Force too, but he was using the ""Dark Side"", making him a Sith lord. As in, not nice like the Jedi knights.With the intimidating size of David Prowse and the first-rate voice work of James Earle Jones, it is no mystery that Darth Vader has evolved into one of the defining icons of sci-fi villainy. Even if he in this film answers to the command of Grand Moff Tarkin, a governor of the Empire played by horror film legend Peter Cushing, who is also the highest rank aboard a moon-sized doomsday weapon known as the Death Star. With it, Tarkin intends to destroy the base where Leia's band of rebels are planning their revolution. Before this, Luke, Han Solo, Obi-Wan, Chewie and the 2 funny droid sidekicks must make their way to the Death Star, rescue the princess and destroy the station. It is a simple adventure, albeit one for the history books, where it will forever be located.Truly, with performances that are still endearing, characters with relatable personalities, allusions to immortal classics (Westerns, sci-fi serials, and samurai flicks especially), groundbreaking special effects that still hold up (no matter what George Lucas will have you believe) and a timeless story that still works to this day, obviously this isn't a film that's going to be forgotten any time soon. Sure, it will be harder with each money-grabbing remastering to find the version of Star Wars that started the legacy, but the fact remains that the franchise is always going to be with us; much like The Force, I imagine.If you were exposed to the Star Wars saga more recently, chances are you've seen one or more of the remastered versions. You might have seen the extra scene with slug-like ganglord Jabba The Hutt, not looking much of anything like he does in Return of The Jedi. You might have beheld an eye-shatteringly ugly re-edit of a scene where Han shoots down an alien bounty hunter named Greedo, now made to look like it's Greedo shooting Han first. Basically, you might have watched this movie after being told it is actually called ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"".The sad thing is that most of the things that seem stupid or pointless to us are probably things that George Lucas legitimately wanted in his film. He visibly didn't have the same amount of control over this project as he would later have over that asinine prequel trilogy, and even so I've read that we actually owe most of what came out as a great film to its editors: Paul Hirsch, Richard Chew and even George's wife Marcia Lucas. They divorced the same year Return of The Jedi was released, in case you couldn't tell by how Lucas has been making Star Wars films since then.But no matter what version you've seen, you have still seen Star Wars. You have still glimpsed the detailed, hand-made models of starships like the Star Destroyers and the Millenium Falcon. You have still experienced the lovely sets and filming locations and, of course, the John Williams music. You have still seen parts of one of the most lovingly crafted movie productions in filmmaking history and no amount of digital polishing (or Porg merch) is going to destroy that for you or any of us.","

"Sober-Friend","13 April 2017","The 1970's is most likely the best decade of films released. Films that were released in that decade set the templates of most film genres. ""Superman"", ""Animal House"", ""Grease"" ""Halloween"", ""The Exorcist"", ""Jaws"", ""Halloween"", ""The Omen"" and most importantly ""Star Wars"". Those films are just the tip of the iceberg. In 1977 there was little fanfare about this film coming from George Lucas. The studio (Fox) though their big release that year was going to be ""The Other Side of Midnight"".""Star Wars"" however was an over budgeted film that Fox did not put much marketing behind (At First). This film however was the first film ever promoted at ""Comic Con"" and that help spread the word that this film was coming. From the first moments on the screen to the closing frames the film the film was a huge feast for the senses. In a nutshell the story is about Rebels trying to destroy ""The Empire"". They control everything in the universe and basically everyone lives in fear of them. The main weapon of ""The Empire"" is the death star. The weapon can destroy a planet. THe Rebels have stolen the plans of the death star and have given them to Princess Leia. The Empire has now captured Princess Leia. Before she was captured she hide the stolen plans in R2d2. She has now sent R2D2 on his own mission to find Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a Jedi who she thinks they can help destroy not only ""The Death Star"" but ""The Empire"" as well.The film is one of the greatest. If you have never seen it on a big screen then you should. This film is always entertaining. It doesn't matter how many times you have watched it!If you can watch the the original theatrical edition. The 1997 Special Edition is fine but the tweaks George Lucas did to it really irk us nerds that feel in love with the original version.

Of course, analyzing special effects today it is possible to notice many things that have not aged so well. However, the film has a very interesting story with very fun characters and a beautiful look, although there are some moments where not all the costumes are perfect. George Lucas' direction is very basic, but this is not something that is a problem throughout the film. There is a big pacing problem at certain times, however, when it manages to maintain an interesting rhythm it becomes incredible. This film isn't perfect, but it's great and deserves great recognition for starting one of the biggest franchises in history.","

A movie that's the perfect combination of great special effects, a great story and memorable characters. All these movies that have been trying to make another ""Star Wars"" over the past two decades generally overlook exactly what made this movie so great in the first place. They tend to just focus on the sets and special effects and overlook the story and characters. George Lucas took great care on all three. A classic movie that will continue to be loved decades from now.

"j30bell","10 March 2005","The best film ever made, period! Allow me to take a contrary view. Not the best film ever made (Les Enfants du Paradis, The Godfather, The Bicycle Thief). Not the best science fiction film (2001, Bladerunner, Gattaca, Code 46) Not even the best film about periods (Carrie).Star Wars brought two things to the audience for the first time; decent sound and visual production and mass marketed toy tie-ins. The first is laudable; the second is where you suspect George Lucus' real talent lies.Like most adults in their early thirties, I got my first taste of Star Wars when I was too young to know better. We were too poor to afford the cinema then, so I watched it on the small screen and still liked it. But now I know better. Star Wars contains some of the hammiest, crummiest dialogue ever uttered by respectable actors. ""Feel the force, Luke!"" Yeah, whatever. If that wasn't enough, Lucas then went back and mucked up that tiny amount character consistency which made it out of the first cut.Star Wars, made at the height of the Cold War and the nadir of American foreign policy, is the good ole story of good ole America spreading its good ole values against a dark, satanic empire. Sound familiar? It's also the story of a poor orphan boy who runs away, rescues a beautiful princess and saves a kingdom from an oppressive tyranny. Sound familiar? Oh yes, and on the way he meets an old man with strange powers, an untrustworthy adventurer and a band of rebels hiding in a forest. Sound familiar? Of course, there is a reason for this. A simple reason. A long time ago in, well, America, Mr Lucas picked up a copy of Campbell's A Hero with a Thousand Faces. This book outlines the fact that all stories have a core of elements in common. Indeed, at a plot level, most stories are essentially the same. Excellent, thinks Lucas, that means I can legitimately rip off better films like the Hidden Fortress and the Dam Busters, better stories like Hamlet and Robin Hood and bastardise Buddhism and Confucianism into the bargain. No need for any original thought whatever, in fact.And thus it was to prove. From the ghostly mentor to the father bearing a terrible secret, Star Wars rehearses every conceivable cinematic (and indeed sub-literary) cliché. Along the way, it inflicts upon us some truly awful dialogue and a paper-thin plot.But these are not the biggest crimes of the film. The worst is that Lucas did not even copy effectively. He forgets, for example, that perfect characters are uninteresting. Mark Hamill may be a fine actor, but his goody-goody clean-cut character grates after just a few minutes of screen time. Harrison Ford fares rather better as Han Solo  so why does Lucas go back and make him fire second in the space bar? It's not just petty, it's puerile.Possibly I should relax, hang loose, go with the flow and not get so uptight. But I just can't help getting irritated. Star Wars is puerile nonsense of the worst kind. The best you can say of it is that it brings the McDonalds experience into the cinema. The worst it is a borderline insult to everyone's intelligence.","

"arthurclay","8 June 2005","And the funny part of this is it is not a science fiction movie. Like Mark Hamill says it is a fantasy! I did not realize this for almost 20 years. The plot elements are all there for a fairy tale. A white knight, a princess, and an evil lord. When I saw this film for the first time I was eight years old. I saw it on laser disc and it blew my mind. I thought ""This absolutely has to be the coolest movie ever made and that guy in the black costume is the most evil looking guy who ever lived."" I believe Darth Vader was number three on the Best Villain List after The Devil and Adolf Hitler. Even now I still think so. I can't believe there is a single person on the face of the Earth who hasn't seen it and if there is I pity them more than I can say. I can't wait for the trilogy to come out on a deluxe edition DVD set. That's the one you're gonna want to own. May the Force be with us.","

"dbdumonteil","8 August 2001","From ""Star Wars "" onwards,sci-fi became the most popular genre for a while.It as a return to simplicity,in spite of the huge special effects.Actually,the screenplay could have been written by a ten-year old,and the characters ,stereotyped and Manichean ,will not do any harm,will not raise intellectual dilemma.Princess Leia Organa is totally sexless and seems to come from some forgotten fairy tale.Luke is a pale shadow from a knight of the round tables without a Graal to conquer,and Han Solo is the masculine raider we've already seen in a lot of movies. Humor,like in Fredric's Brown tales?none,unless the two robots count. Mystery ,like in AC Clarke's 2001?none,unless Darth Vader 's hidden identity counts? The last quarter of the movie recalls a giant video game. After ""star wars""(and close encounters of the third kind) ,intellectual sci-fi was over the hill;now two kinds would share the market between them:the harmless sci-fi for toddlers and brats(Star War saga,ET,the black hole)and the horrific ,brainless and witless sci-fi (Alien and sequels)""2001"" became an ET movie and its overwhelming genius did not influence anymore,alas.","

"bat-5","22 October 1998","Twenty one years ago in late August my mom took me to see Star Wars.  It is the first movie that I can remember seeing in a theatre.  Being four years old I didn't know what to expect, but when the lights went out and that fanfare came on, I was mesmerized.  Then the movie started, and when those ships roared across the screen, I just sat there, amazed.  As the film progressed I was introduced to all of the characters that populate this film.  I remember being frightened when I first saw Darth Vader.  I remember the battle over the Death Star, the X-Wings and TIE Fighters blowing up and Luke being chased by Vader.  Then, the Death Star explodes.  Needless to say, I've never forgotten that experience.Twenty years later, I was thrilled to relive the experience.  I went to see Star Wars again in the theatre.  It was truly magical, I felt like I was four again, and going to see my first movie.  This movie will always be my favorite, sure there are other films that are arguably better.  Try telling that to a four year old.","

Overall, an important movie to watch in what created one of the most iconic franchises in the world and helped jump-start a story that is beloved by many through its technical achieves and story-writing, even though the direction is a bit lacking.Very Good Direction (The actual moving of the story and making sure all pieces come together is incredibly managed and executed, it is just the actual direction of characters was pretty poorly done (which kinda reveals the truth that George Lucas is a visionary in storytelling, but not that Great in actually directing people)), Very Good Acting (Good to Very Good from the Live-Action Cast; Very Good to Great from the Vocal/Costumed-Characters) (Very Good from Mark Hamill (Really excelled at playing the naive kid who is interested in helping very well, shows a bit of inexperience but that is to be accepted when he is playing a very young character that is the hero), Very Good to Great from Harrison Ford (The real star of the show in all his scenes as his smooth/cool nature really helps show how great of a character Han Solo really is (though there are moments that are kinda iffy with the awkwardness and silence from line deliveries)), Pretty Good from Carrie Fisher (Her performance does not compete with the others but she does play the damsel in distress character trope very well (though it is a bit annoying when she is changing between accents as it sounds like she is putting on a fake English accent at times)), Pretty Good to Good from Peter Cushing (Not really that much in the movie despite his high billing), Great from Alec Guinness (Really shows his experience as an actor in this performance as he has much range in showing both care for Luke yet trauma from his past that still effects him), Very Good from Anthony Daniels (Really brings C-3PO to life as he tries to help but panics in not knowing how much he can (the anxious nerd-savior trope); also, plays a great role in helping vocalize the relationship and friendship he has with R2-D2), Incredible from Kenny Baker (Really brings R2 to life through the difference mannerisms the character has in sort of a comedic relief yet important way (making R2 one of the best characters in all of Star Wars); also, helps bring the flare that makes the character's friendship with C-3PO one of the best in pop-culture), Very Good from Peter Mayhew (Played the adorable, yet extremely dangerous Chewie and played off his co-star very nicely, similar to the R2/C-3PO relationship), Incredible from James Earl Jones/David Prowse (Created one of the most iconic voices in pop-culture as his menacing voice and performance showed why Darth Vader is a villain to be scared of), Very Good from the rest of the Live-Action cast; Very Good from the rest of the Vocal/Costumed-Characters cast), Brilliant Story (Created a world that is one of the most iconic today; the character writing is incredible as they are some of the most iconic characters in pop culture; the way the story ties all the different movies together (both prequel and later films) is very well done and visionary), Very Good Screenplay (The actual dialogue was not that well written as it felt very unnatural (as was seen from the characters trying to say the words), but where the screenplay shines is the foreshadowing to future Star Wars events, symbolism, iconic lines, and character writing to introduce the Star Wars universe as a cinematic achievement), Brilliant Score (One of the most iconic scores in cinema history and is very well used throughout the movie), Great Cinematography, Incredible Sound (Especially when giving the movie a space/science-fiction feel as well as bringing the sounds of the droids (especially R2-D2) to life), Very Good to Great Editing, Cannot rate Visual Effects (The original Visual Effects were incredible for how revolutionary they were at the time of the release, but the added CGI from the re-release makes it very hard to watch as it just feels so forced and out of place with the original effects), Incredible Production Design (Created some very iconic sets that are well remembered in history), Incredible Makeup (Helped bring to life aliens that are not from this world), Incredible Costumes (Created some of the most iconic outfits in pop-culture history, with the Darth Vader costume being one of the most well remembered in any historical context), Plot Structure was very well written as each piece builds on the previous one as everything matters in building up the movie and moving the story forward (so nothing to really add or remove), Pacing can be a bit slower at times but does maintain a very steady pace throughout the movie (pace very typical of movies from that time-period), Build to climax was very well done as the movie treats the actual build as the climax (so we are building to this build very nicely throughout the movie); Climax was kinda thrown at us as in the grand scheme of things we did not build to this (we built up to the build as previously stated) but it was very well executed and really shows off the technical marvels that the original film was very groundbreaking for; moreover helps provide some insight into Luke's quest in finding the force and taking his first step in becoming a Jedi, Tone was that typical to a space opera or science fiction epic but does have some unique feel to it that makes it very Star Wars, A ground-breaking movie not only in Cinema-history but actual history as well as it ushered in a new way to view and create stories and was an inspiration for the rise in the Science-Fiction genre in the 80s and 90s.","

"theshadow908","12 January 2006","Star Wars, now known as Star Wars Episode IV, is a great classic. It's still amazing how it's held up after all these years. It tells the story of Luke Skywalker, a poor farm boy who, after meeting old Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, begins the greatest journey of his life. He goes up against the evil empire and Darth Vader, who has a past with Obi Wan. Not a whole lot happens in this original Star Wars, but it revolutionized sci-fi films as we know them, with battling space ships, laser guns, and hologram communication. The acting and the writing isn't the greatest there's ever been, but it doesn't stop the movie from being completely enjoyable. Star Wars totally deserves the attention it gets and the money it makes from books, video games, TV shows, toys, and it's following sequels.Star Wars will forever remain a classic, even if critics continue to ignore George Lucas's creativity.8/10","

"Rammstein-2","12 January 2001","What more can be said about a film that has never released its grip on its audience, and that has become one of the most legendary films ever? Not much, but as a sci-fi fan, I have to voice my utter thankfulness that this film was realized. It has given millions of people two hours of the very best in space adventure drama. The classic theme of good versus evil in a wonderful movie filled with details and characters to set every sci-fi buff humming. It's magic. It's wondrous. And it's probably one of the most entertaining movies ever made, along with it's sequels. The ""Star Wars"" saga is really a genre of it's own, it's hard to imagine how to compare it to anything else - it stands out from all the rest in an impressive way - no one has ever tried to make anything like it, and if they would, they wouldn't succeed.The stuff that dreams are made of...","

"LaBelleAurore","22 May 2005","This film single-handedly changed modern cinema to what we know it to be today. It is the ultimate modern fairy tale. A young knight runs off with a wise old wizard to save the princess from the clutches of evil. Of course, it runs a little deeper than that, and makes the old tale of good versus evil so much more compelling. Setting it long ago in a galaxy far, far away is pure genius and it introduces us to a futuristic galaxy of beautiful style and diversity that leaves us with a fantastic space opera. Despite its unfamiliar setting, we can relate to all the characters. There's the handsome maverick, the beautiful heroine, the aspiring young knight, the wise old mentor, and the darkly clad villain. Even the droids are characters we can recognise and relate to. What is so special about this film is that the distractions of things like politics, geography, and nationality are eliminated to leave us with simple humanity. This film has everything you could ever want. The characters are great; the action's great; the story is magnificent, and of course there's philosophy too.... Oh, what am I talking about? I just think lightsabers are cool...","

"frannywentzel","2 July 2006","by all means If you've never seen this movie, see it on the Betamax or Selectivision CED or Laserdisc formats first because George Lucas' subsequent remixes are awful and will really will ruin the experience for you.I'm fortunate enough to have the original Trilogy on Betamax cassette as well as having the modern DVD series. All I can say is Lucas got it right the first time. Every ""new"" sequence goes on too long and stops the story dead.No...Really...Lucas tries to justify the ""new"" material as being ""what he wanted but couldn't afford or get"" in 1977. Well, Stephen Spielberg wanted a whole lot more shark in his ""Jaws"" movie but circumstances (his mechanical fish didn't work too great) prevented that and Jaws was all the better for it. Sometimes you have to let serendipity work for you.The spectacular success of the 1977 print should be proof that you got it right the first time. At the least Lucas should've allowed us to chose between the original and remix since DVD technology allows such a choice.In the meantime I'm going to have to get around to dubbing my Betamax tapes to DVD so I can keep them on a more permanent format.And let me add - Han Solo shot first, dammit! <- that was the spoiler...","

"dsilverman","26 June 2005","After seeing the latest and last Star Wars (Episode 3), I wondered if the first was as good as I remembered it, or had I just gotten tired of all things Star Wars. Tonight we watched the DVD of the first one (The New Hope or Episode 4, as its now called). What a contrast! Real people, real feelings and emotions, humor, adventure, The Cantina Bar, Luke getting in touch with the Force within, Han Solo's sarcasm, Obiwan's wisdom...Alec Guiness brings a depth to the role lacking in the recent movies....but then again, all of these elements seem lacking in the recent movies. The first one is still a gem! Lucas should have stopped here.","

Absolutely nothing, perhaps that this blockbuster from 1977 was the start of it all. When you see it more than 25 years later it might look a bit dated in some ways but you know that this movie was responsible for oner of the biggest impacts on the silver screen ever that you forget it all. This is the ultimate wet dream for anyone who like to be blown away by some fantasyadventure, hell...every second of this movie has been spoken about, theories were given just like if ""Star Wars"" was the most important thing ever and in our little fantasyworld it perhaps can be... A movie to be see over and over and an epic that will arise above all, people still will watch 1000 years later, if only we live...","

"OttoVonB","3 May 2004","Star Wars is the stuff of legends, mainly because it finds its inspiration in countless folk legends and archetypes, but also because it became the inspiration of an era. It was probably the first ever cinematic cult phenomenon and one can measure its power by the sway it still holds 27 years after its release.The story couldn't be simpler frankly so do dwell on this detail would be to miss the point entirely. The backdrop is the main character of the film and it is nothing short of miraculous! The alien vistas and locals while otherworldly have a worn look that makes them unbelievably real (unlike the often fake-looking CGI of the prequels). The technology looks real. This authentic look gives the action scenes a power almost transcendental. It surpasses anything we've ever seen because despite it's otherworldlyness it all works. So the world Lucas creates more than makes up for the bland characterizations (these are only archetypes after all so don't expect too much depth, that's a advantage Empire Strikes Back has over the entire saga) and acting, although veterans Alec Guiness, Peter Cushing and James Earl Jones give this more dignity and weight and there's a very welcome cynical ""this can't be real"" look from Ford that means the film doesn't take itself all too seriously (something lacking in the prequels).This vision of fantasy has it's flaws but it still solidly deserves cult status for it's gargantuan strengths: a legendary score by John Williams, era-defining special effects, a mythology and fantasy that rival anything ever imagined by a film-maker, great action and a pure naive heart that makes it impossible to resist and is seriously lacking in today's blockbusters.Star Wars is more than a film: it is in itself a reason to love movies. It is a testimonial to man's imaginative powers.","

"CalDexter","4 October 2004","Star Wars was the film that changed cinema forever. It had everything, brilliant special effects, a scary villain, fully built set pieces that you had never seen before, a brilliant music score from John Williams and likable characters in Han Solo and Obi-wan Kenobi well played by Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness. It was a film that had blazing action from start to finish, it was a film that the writer and director George Lucas had intended for children, his target audience was twelve and under, but it became a true mega blockbuster and people of all ages came again and again, dragging their friends with them.My favourite scenes include the opening sequence: the massive imperial Star Destroyer roaring over the screen attacking the fleeing rebel cruiser, that scene is mind-blowing on a cinema screen, i love the introduction of Darth Vader emerging from the smoke of the laser battle between the Stormtroopers and the Rebels, i also like the way Vader is established as an evil killer right away when he crushes the neck of some poor hapless rebel prisoner holding him up with one hand and throwing him to the side like a rag doll, this gives Vader's character a sense of malevolence from the kickoff.I also like the lightsaber duel between obi-wan and Vader on the Death Star more so for the verbal exchanges between the two Jedi 'When i was with you i was but the learner now i am the master.' Obi-wan:'Only a master of evil DARTH!!!' The duel is not as energetic as Luke and Vader in The Empire Strikes Back, but it is still a powerful and moving moment especially when Luke, Han and Leia make a dash for the falcon and Luke sees Obi-wan cornered by Vader. That scene is one of emotion that Lucas hits right on the head, Luke sees Obi-wan's plight, Obi-wan smiles at Vader, he raises his sabre and closes his eyes, Vader strikes as look screams 'NO!' and John Williams score swells with tragic loss as Luke blasts away at the Stormtroopers. Its the one scene that sticks in my mind about A New Hope, that isn't special effects or cgi.The final aerial assault between TIE fighters and X-wing fighters over the Death Star is perhaps the most exciting finale of any movie, the tunnel chase with Luke's X-wing and Vader's TIE fighter thrills ALL the time. Finally i have to say when i talk to people who have seen Star wars in any shape or form, rarely do they say they don't like the movies, but when i do meet someone that hates these classics they ALWAYS say the same thing: 'Im not really interested in films.' That says it all, does it not?","

"mOVIemAN56","11 April 2005","Star Wars was considered a breakthrough in movie making and visual effects together and I agree. George Lucas has made what is considered the coolest and greatest universe ever. Having been denied from almost every major motion picture company he was able to get it released from 20th Century Fox.The story is simple yet extraordinary. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is a young moisture farmer on the desert planet Tatooine and lives with his aunt and uncle. After buying two droids (robots) Skywalker hears a story and wants to help the beautiful Princess Leia being held by the evil empire. Skywalker ends up befriending a few unlikely characters: Han Solo (Harrison Ford) as a pilot, his sidekick and co-pilot Chewbacca the Wookie (Peter Mayhew), and Ben Kenobi (Alec Guiness) and head for a large battle station to rescue her.But standing in their way is the evil empire, the robotic man Darth Vader, and his battle -station the Death Star which is able to destroy entire planets. The story, though pretty much a rescue story, is catchy and exciting filled with loads of action and encounters with hundreds of bizarre aliens. Star Wars is one of the best films I have ever seen and gave birth to the Sci-Fi industry in Hollywood. The characters are entertaining and slick. The action is faced paced and visually stunning. Star Wars: A New Hope. Starring: Mark Hamill, Alec Guiness, Harrison Ford, Peter Cushing, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, and Carrie Fisher.5 out of 5 Stars.","

"FiendishDramaturgy","26 October 2003","What made this the hugely successful triumph it was? Was it casting, music, imagination, ingenuity, or luck?I remember opening day at the theaters. I was old enough to remember every scene, every character, every nuance of this film; having committed it to memory forever, as if I would never again be able to see this beloved, instantly loved masterpiece.I also remember that the HIT factor of this movie was so unexpected that you had to wait literal MONTHS to get the action figures promised on the cereal boxes. The pieces were still in the manufacturing process and we had to settle for coupons promising our toys in a few months. I wound up seeing this in the theaters a grand total of 36 times; much to my mother's dismay. She loved the movie as I did, but felt I was obsessed. Today, thirty years later, sitting here writing this review, I realize how right she was. I'm still obsessed with this movie, and with the subsequent movies which followed. I wait in great anticipation for Episode 3. I'm a fan, and I don't care what other people say about Episodes 1 & 2. I don't even mind the ""prequel"" factor, as the situation at the time, dictated to Lucas which movies he would do first.See, I remember the studios saying to him that he had to choose from the three central climactic books, and trash the rest, or just trash the whole idea. He didn't exactly ""sell out,"" he did what he had to do to get his movie...his vision...out there for us to see and experience. I admired his decision then, and I admire it now. Episodes 1-3 are being filmed now, because Lucas had the clout, the money, and the patience to give us his vision...his complete vision and not just the three center books of a 9-book series. I realize that now, there are dozens of books, but at the time, there were nine. And while most of us were happy with Episodes 4-6 and would not have missed 1-3 and 7-9, I personally am so very glad he has taken it upon himself to give us his full vision. I have enjoyed each and every installment with the same sense of awe and joy as I did this one.The casting was the first triumph for this cinematic milestone. Ford is a charismatic and magnetic personality and portrayed Han with a professionalism that you'd expect from more seasoned actors. Sir Alec Guiness is an absolute joy as Obi Wan. His casting was precise and excellent in that part. Carrie Fisher portrayed Leia in a way that, up until then, had never been experienced. Most ""princess"" types before her were whining, whimpering, little snots who were incapable of anything beyond tripping and twisting their ankle in times of peril, while Fisher portrayed her character as a bold, brazen, yet sophisticated and educated woman who was aware of her surroundings and capable of defending herself and her realm with the utmost authority.And Mark Hamil. He was perfectly cast as the whining little boy who wanted more, but was afraid to reach for it. He grows up quite well on film in these three installments, and endears himself to the audience so much the more for it. But a cast member who is almost always left out of these reviews is Peter Mayhew. Chewbacca. His character, as a supporting character to Han's, was exemplary. It's not easy portraying a walking carpet, yet holding the attention, admiration, and love of virtual millions. I am VERY happy about his being cast as Chewy in Episode 3. Couldn't happen to a more deserving...or capable...fellow. Bravo! And James Earl Jones's voice being used as the voice of Darth Vader, was pure genius. His commanding voice haunted the dreams of countless thousands of star-struck children for generations to come. I also have to say that this movie would not have had the charm it does had it not been for Anthony Daniels' C3P0. He is a gift and a joy.The musical score by John Williams featured in this masterpiece was one of the contributing factors. But honestly, this movie's success was such a total surprise to everyone, including Lucas, that nothing could prepare the world for the aftermath of having witnessed this bona fide legend, first hand.The story itself; replete with sub-plot after sub-plot, rich in dialog and detail, was beyond anyone's greatest expectations. Everyone, including Lucas, expected this movie to fail. It is a timeless classic, which I will not repeat here. There are too many movie reviews giving full details of the plot, and I won't be redundant beyond what I have already said.However, that being said, there are a few points I would like to make concerning the symbolism of this endeavor. The Force is a metaphor for the psychic abilities with which we are all born. It was also a metaphor for hope and faith, dedication and commitment to the greater state of being. The Empire is said to have been a metaphor for the Germanic Nazi ""storm troopers."" While the Rebellion is said to have been symbolic of (what would later become) the NATO forces who defeated them.And then there are the effects. The effects were, in 1977, so awesome; so creative; so ahead of their time, as to ensure this movie's vast success for the next forty years. George Lucas enjoys an almost god-like status among sci-fi/fantasy fans worldwide.This movie does not rate a rating. Usually, when I say that, it is because the movie is so bad, or disappointing that I don't have the heart to rate it. But in this case, it far surpasses any 10/10 rating I could give it.The Fiend :.","

"ivo-cobra8","23 April 2016","Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) is a classic phenomenal arguably the best sci-fi film in trilogy away, the one that started all and arguably changed the face of cinema forever. I love this film is actually my number 1 favorite film in the franchise and it is George Lucas masterpiece - the man who make this film happening. He wrote and Directed him self, I love this film to death! I love everything that is in A New Hope. Before I go in to this movie I want to say after watching the new awful horrible movie Episode VII The Force Awakens, I decide to re watch the original Star Wars Trilogy and I have always loved A New Hope and I always will. This was the first film in the trilogy that I have saw as a kid and that I remember. Star Wars are starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.The plot is actually more about Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia (Fisher), and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empire's space station, the Death Star. It is a mission returning the plans of Death Star to the Rebel Alliance, while Galactic Empire want's them back and it is lead by Darth Vader (David Prowse). This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and Special Effects.Star Wars is a film that I have watch it now and I will always watch it , because how much I really, really enjoy this film. This fun, pure joy, entertaining and truly a great film is like a classic, I recommend this film to any fan of the Star Wars trilogy, my favorite will always be A New Hope. This was the film that I have saw the first time as a kid and it grow on me. I love introduction when C-3PO and R2-D2 are walking trough the desert on planet Tatooine and are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew, Luke Skywalker. Here is the first time we met the character Luke Skywalker. This is the scene where C-3PO is walking trough the desert him self and than he saw someone far away and yells for help. I love this scene and it is the scene I remember from childhood.Which is your favorite character? My favorite character of all time is Luke Skywalker and I really love him so much. My second favorite character will be Han Solo but Luke Skywalker will be the ultimate hero of the galaxy for me.I love this flick, I love the end battle on Death Star, Luke joins the Rebel assault squadron and Luke becomes one of the few surviving pilots. Vader leads a squad of TIE fighters and prepares to attack Luke's X-wing fighter, but Han returns and fires on the Imperials, sending Vader spiraling away. Helped by guidance from Obi-Wan's spirit, Luke uses the Force and successfully destroys the Death Star seconds before it can fire on the Rebel base. I love that scene.I love John Williams score for Star wars which is the best score ever! It is an excellent score makes an actions scenes more exciting and more intense. George Lucas directed this movie well and did an excellent job been a writer as the same time been the director, the pacing is excellent the actors does an awesome job. I also love and I have enjoyed the character Darth Vader and I also love this film because it has a happy ending. Harrison Ford , Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher did all a great joy playing their characters.Carrie Fisher is really gorgeous in this film and for the 70's film it had great pacing and great imaginary story that dose not gives you only a snippet of the backstory. The fight scene between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi was excellent and the death scene of Obi-Wan was a honorable death. Alec Guinness did a perfect job as Obi-Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi he is excellent. Overall: I have said everything about this film that I love I forgot to mention I love Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker (I love to death), Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2. This flick get's a perfect 10 because it is the best beloved science fiction film.R.I.P. Carrie Fisher (1956 - 2016) she was the perfect Princess Leia and she is very missed.","

"mentalcritic","31 March 2003","I was actually born about a year after this film first premiered, but being a member of a family that was the first on the block to get such things as the VCR and the proper Hi-Fi system allowed me to catch this film in a number of different formats in the years ranging from 1982 to 1997. I think it is safe to say that without this film, I would have had no idea how truly evil a thing Pan And Scan is, or why multi-channel audio is such a damned important thing to have in the home theatre environment.Of course, I also knew that the film wasn't perfect. I could see a number of small problems where Lucas' budget just didn't quite go far enough, or where there just wasn't enough time to accomplish what was wanted. So when the announcement was made that in 1997, each film would be presented with improved special effects and footage that could not be integrated in the original cut for reasons of budget or practicality, I was excited.For the most part, I was overjoyed to see the new footage or effects. Mos Eisley now looks like a real city or port of commerce, without the viewer's sense of disbelief at the seemingly deserted streets needing to be suspended. The flight of the X-Wings towards the Death Star in its original form was very good, a marvel of its time, but when George finally got to show it the way he wanted to, it was almost the equivalent of watching the helicopters of Apocalypse Now decimating the village to the tune of Ride Of The Valkyries. The wonderfully composed tracking shots especially made the battle look almost as if it really happened and Lucas was just there to take pictures. And Jabba? Well, he doesn't look all that real, granted, but it was just nice to have that one piece of footage in order to make the appearance of Boba Fett in Episode V and the entire prologue of Episode VI make a bit more sense, especially to dullards.Unfortunately, there are a number of times when Lucas just goes too far in his quest to improve his work. Sometimes you can only do so much to anything before it starts to look overdone. Of course, I am talking about the scene between Han and Greedo in the cantina. In the original version, we are led to believe Han is a scoundrel who only cares about himself, giving us one of the best character arcs in the whole trilogy. It is also a great tribute to Sergio Leone, a nice reference to when Tuco shoots a potential assassin from his bathtub and tells the corpse ""When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk!"". Modifying this scene so it looks like Greedo shot first is an insult on a few levels. It insults Greedo as a character, making him look like one of the most incompetent bounty hunters in the galaxy. It insults the audience, who even at the age of six should no that you'd have to be blind, drunk, brain-damaged, or all three, to miss from that distance. Lastly, it insults the character of Han Solo by destroying a vital piece of said character arc. Watching Han go from scum to a leader of men, a space-age version of King Aragorn even, was one of the best things about the original Star Wars trilogy.The story itself is the stuff of classics in that it shows the most unlikely of heroes doing things that everyone else claims to be impossible. What Lucas got right in terms of pacing and plot here is exactly where he went wrong in the prequels, in that he makes the jump from location to location seem important to the plot and totally natural, rather than forced and choppy. The story and sense of adventure makes one forget that there are really only three major locations other than the inside of a space ship.Overall, the original Star Wars rates an eight out of ten. If Lucas had applied some common sense in conjunction with his rampant desire for revisionism, I would give it a ten, but as one critic who is famous for his negativity once said about Episode II, when was the last time anyone told George Lucas no? Still, this is a classic that should be shown to future generations as an example of how an imagination and enough literacy to realise it will open doors for you when nothing else will.","

"Sleepin_Dragon","18 September 2023","The Empire look set to continue their relentless war effort, new technology means they are pretty much unopposed, but a small band including Like Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo, look to fight back.I'm not sure what I can add that hasn't already been said, instead I'll try and imagine what it must have been like for someone, someone young perhaps, heading to the cinema in 1977, seeing this film for the first time.Consider what had gone before, people had Star Trek, and various other shows, but this film must have left audiences speechless, as there was quite literally nothing else like it.This film changed not just sci fi, but film making in general, the sheer scale and imaginative of it shame many of today's mediocre offerings.You have to admire the sheer bravery and audacity to get this film made, you wonder what doubts George Lucas had, he must have been elated when audiences turned round and fell in love with it.It's funny, entertaining, exciting, jaw dropping, moving, it's everything you want from a movie, years on, it's still a masterpiece.10/10.","

A New Hope is so awesome in so many aspects especially the music and sounds of everything! It's amazing how it was made for it's time I still I don't understand how they did many things.

"Bogmeister","25 December 2005","Though now known as ""Episode IV-A New Hope,"" for many of us, namely those of us who first saw this exhilarating entertainment in theaters back in '77, this will always be the first ""Star Wars."" We will always think of it as just ""Star Wars"" - plain & simple, no pretensions, no aspirations to deep film-making or high art. This is where we first met them all: Luke, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi (old 'Ben'), Chewbacca, the 2 robots C3PO & R2D2 and, of course, Darth Vader. They were instant pop culture icons; you got the sense you'd seen them before somewhere, but were sure this wasn't possible. But they'd been there before in our minds. We'd read about them constantly in science fiction novels and short stories - tales of outer space civilizations, of spaceships zooming through asteroid belts, of exotic-looking aliens hanging around space ports. We'd dream about them at night and try to imagine ourselves in their midst; up until then, we could only imagine such things - there were no projected images to realize such dreams. ""Forbidden Planet"" from 1956 came close, and then there were the ""Star Trek"" and ""Lost in Space"" TV series, both hampered by dime store budgets and cheesy sets. We ate 'em up since there was nothing else. Then Lucas made it real.I remember when I first got wind of the upcoming movie, to open in May of 1977, I think. I saw the first publicized poster and bought the novel adaptation. On the poster, a young man stood with some light sword raised, a princess at his feet, numerous spaceships flying all over the place. I was in my mid-teens and felt the first pulse of building excitement as I realized all those fantastic tales I'd been reading the past few years were going to come alive on the big screen for me. It didn't disappoint. Luke Skywalker, who stood in for all the boys pretending to be on a galactic adventure, gets swept away from his mundane desert home smack dab into the middle of an honest-to-gosh galaxy-wide civil war! The strength of the narrative is / was amazing. There are no slow spots and you can't wait for the next scene during the entire experience; and, experience is the better description for it, rather than just 'movie.' You can't wait, for example, for the moment when Luke actually meets the princess; what will happen then? It's a textbook case of an exciting narrative and what I believe makes this superior to all the sequels (knowing that many feel ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is superior - I must disagree).The one character you really can't wait to see again is the ominous Vader, naturally. The instant he steps into view during the first few minutes of the story, you just know this is the ultimate villain. This is the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool, the supreme uber-evildoer of the entire galaxy. You just know it by his stance, by his attitude, and by the electric chill that runs through your frail form as he steps down the corridor, moving into the annals of film history with one fell swoop. You can't wait to see what he does next, what nefarious action will send someone or some planet to its doom. Sure, he seems under the control of Tarkin (Cushing) here and later, the Emperor, but you just know he's simply biding his time until he takes over the whole damn universe. There is no precedent for Vader, and nothing close to him after. He's at his best here where there's still much mystery attached to his dark frightful form, a minion of Satan and Nazi stormtroopers all rolled into one.This was also the movie-experience which catapulted Harrison Ford (Solo) into superstardom. He seems almost childish here, not really straining to create a character, and it's this flip charm that makes it work, against all odds. He really does appear to have stepped out of the pages of some juvenile space opera, laser guns blazing, all snide remarks and foolhardy bravado. But he also becomes the older brother figure to Luke, who cannot carry the story by himself. Hamill, whose movie career began & ended with Luke, epitomizes the center of destiny for a galaxy. Both humble and arrogant, he's perfect in the role. Fisher's main surprise is that she's not all sugar and sweet as one would expect of a princess. These three characters evolved in the next two films, but they were always at their best here, icons given life for a short period - but also forever in film. The same could be said for Alec Guinness as Kenobi, a first class act all the way. You almost believe this elderly warrior could topple an empire, given enough time. Unless he runs into Vader...","

"paul_haakonsen","31 December 2015","Having grown up with the ""Star Wars"" trilogy, then ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is a classic in every sense of the word. This is the epic story of good vs. evil and of light vs. dark. But it is also a story of heroism, bravery and adventure. I am an fan-boy, yes, but what is there not to love about ""Star Wars""?George Lucas really managed to piece together a timeless classic that stands its own even today. And even with effects from 1977 it was light years ahead of its time, no pun intended. And the effects stand their ground even by todays standards.There is something uniquely amazing about the atmosphere and feel of the ""Star Wars"" universe. And it doesn't require much to be swept away and carried along to a galaxy far, far away...The cast in ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" did a good and memorable job with their individual roles and characters. And with this movie George Lucas established some characters that instantly became well-known and well-loved.""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is a movie of high space adventure with vibrant characters, creatures and spaceships. It is an enjoyable movie for the entire family, space nerds or not.If you are not already familiar with the legendary ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" movie, then it is more than due time to get to it.","

"SantiagoDM1","27 July 2018","""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...""Pre review:Its writing started in January 1973, ""eight hours a day, five days a week"", George Lucas said by taking small notes, inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterization... After many drafts, he finally came to a satisfactory conclusion.Then, Lucas presented Star Wars to the United Artists, but they refused to budget the film, so he went to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it was rejected, as the film concept was ""too strange"".Suddenly, Alan Ladd Jr -head of 20th Century Fox- appeared, a man that trusted in Lucas' genius. And that's how Star Wars became a reality.The shooting of the movie was full of mishaps, problems with practical effects never done before, a bad first edit of the movie, but that didn't stop George from fulfilling his Space Opera. Due to those setbacks, Fox Studios began to put pressure on Lucas to finish the movie. Finally, the movie was done. On the eve of Star Wars release, 20th Century Fox, George Lucas and his cast and crew braced themselves for the worse. One way or another, May 25, 1977 would be a day they would never forget...Review:Star Wars is a modern tale of mythic adventure. It follows the journey and growth of the protagonist: Luke Skywalker. His journey of discovery is set amidst a larger struggle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance; both parties are embroiled in a civil war. The Empire is comprised of corrupted power within a small group of leaders. These sullied leaders abuse their power over the masses with impunity. It is oppression and repression of the masses. The Empire wants to destroy the hope of the rebellion to ensure the small group of leaders can keep their power...One of the most important features of the movie are the special effects. The use motion control was even superior to Stanley Kubrick's revolutionary masterpiece: ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" thanks to the creation of The Dykstraflex, the first digital motion control photography camera system developed for Star Wars on 1976. Along with an incredibly iconographic character and production design, the movie became stylistically unique.The story and the characters are original and relatable. R2-D2 and C-3PO: the astromech as the optimistic adventurer's desiring to move forward. In direct opposition C-3PO, the protocol droid filled with doubt and reservations. Luke Skywalker, the brave hero, often haunted by doubts and hopes about his future journey. Obi-Wan Kenobi, the wise master and moral guidance of our hero. Han Solo, the rebellious smuggler whose personality represents tenacity. Leia, the damsel ""in distress"", a fearsome princess and general. Finally, Darth Vader, the most iconic character in the franchise, the merciless tyrant in a black suit, representing evil and final conflict of the journey.The film score presents an emotional resonance trough a romantic 1930s Hollywood orchestral score that was commissioned for composer John Williams, who succeeded to create a haunting constellation of operatic leitmotifs.The visual composition is authentic, as Lucas wanted a nostalgic ""filtered look"" so he kept changing key lights for a ""flashing"" effect. He used a loose, ""nervous"" frame, as in newsreels. The dramatic center was displaced, deflecting the eye to background activity, which in later films would include poetically changing weather. This first film gradually turned darker, following a symbolic color scheme where organic brown and warm gold yielded to high-tech black, white, and steely gray."" This is authenticity is reflected in it's most iconic shot: the 'Binary Sunset' sequence, which establishes the narrative through-line of the story and the world it takes place in, the main value of the scene lies in how powerfully and economically it develops Luke's character: As the suns begin to slowly sink in the evening sky, he gazes towards the horizon, his sense of longing for something more is palpable. Taking things further, he goes on to squint into the distance as if he could see his new future just out of reach, and for the first time we get to see him not as a kid, but for as a new hope.Books such as ""The hero with a thousand faces"" by Joseph Campbell structured the story, The War of Vietnam inspired the battle between the Rebels and the Empire, the lifestyle of buddhist monks characterized the Jedi, real shots of warplanes made the space battles real, Kendo foreshadowed the epic lightsaber duel, Akira Kurosawa's storytelling influenced the focus on minor characters, Fritz Lang's it's iconic protocol droid and John Ford westerns determined it's soul.The fascination with filmmaking and anthropology are the components that allowed Star Wars to be compelling and human, besides being located on a galaxy far, far away.10/10","

"TheLittleSongbird","22 November 2009","I couldn't have asked for anything more. Star Wars: A New Hope had it all. If I had to sum it up in one word, superlative would be my answer. I saw the film for the first time three months ago and loved it, and since then I have watched all the Star Wars movies. I was disappointed with the prequels (Attack of the Clones was my least favourite), but this, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back were perfection.I have to say that the film looks absolutely amazing even after thirty plus years, with highly imaginative sets and dazzling special effects. And the action sequences were superbly choreographed and brisk, the Death Star climax was a knockout. The music by John Williams is absolutely outstanding, by far one of his more exciting and rousing scores. The story is fast-paced, intelligent and has an essence of sophistication, and the screenplay is sharp and decisive.And the performances were flawless. In the prequels I had problems relating to some of the performers, namely Hayden Christensen as Anakin. Here, all the actors played their parts with superlative skill. Alec Guiness, one fine actor and will be sorely missed was a standout, likewise with Peter Cushing and Harrison Ford(hilarious here). Carrie Fisher was a fine Princess Leia, spunky, beautiful and sexy, and Mark Hamill was a completely likable Luke. And the villain Darth Vader, without doubt one of the best and in-depth villains in cinematic history, and James Earl Jones's deep booming voice was perfect for the character.All in all, a definite sci-fi classic, that blew me away. 10/10 Bethany Cox","

"budmassey","25 April 2005","Here begins the greatest cinematic epic of all time, and arguably one of the greatest stories ever told. Originally conceived as a serialized popcorn movie in the manner of the old action movies that Lucas grew up with, Star Wars surpassed even George's keen and bombastic imagination to become a central part of movie history.There are countless tales of the making of this movie; how Lucas never believed he would get the chance to complete the series, how it spawned an industry and made the name of nearly everyone who touched it a household word. But what that does not reveal, nor do the much diminished prequels, is the sheer joy and excitement these movies generated.It was a once in a lifetime experience. You could feel it from opening day, earlier if you paid attention to such things. We had never seen anything like it, and we are not likely to again.This episode finds young Luke Skywalker yearning to leave the agrarian life he has with his aunt and uncle, and chase after adventure as his friends before him have already done. And what adventure there is. The galaxy is in the grip of a massive rebellion against a tyrannical and oppressive empire, but on Luke's home planet, it's something you only dare speak of in a whisper.Along come two robots, ""Droids"" for short, who inadvertently involve Luke in a stellar attempt to contact an old wizard named Ben Kenobi, who lives in the caves near Luke's home.The rest is history, and there isn't a person alive in the civilized world who doesn't have at least some awareness of the epic story that unfolds. Luke's rise from adolescent obscurity on Tatooine to a leading role in the greatest struggle of all time is told with humor, action, adventure, and always a sense of story that is unmatched on the screen or on the page.With the completion of the prequel trilogy, these films are enjoying a renewed popularity among a generation that never saw the films on the big screen, and the theatric revivals are almost guaranteed. Go. Get some popcorn. And may the Force be with you.","

"Sfpsycho415","22 October 2003","I can never pick a favorite movie because different movies have different effects. Goodfellas is my favorite drama. Face/Off is my favorite actioner. But when it comes to pure amazement, nothing beats Star Wars. We are introduced to a whole other universe with different creatures, different lifestyles, and different history. We are dropped in the middle of an intergalactic war between an empire and a rebellion that has raged for years and left the universe in ruin. It was the most fascinating thing to see when i was eleven, but to this day i am still a Star Wars nerd.The cast of characters includes some of the coolest, funniest, and most tragic in film, and the actors who play them fit seamlessly into this new universe. Alec Guiness is flawless as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi on the run from the evil Empire. Harrison Ford is awesome as Han Solo, a smuggler and thief who helps the gang rescue the princess. But the my favorite character of all time is Darth Vader. Not only is he the coolest bad guy, but we learn in later films why he is evil and start to feel sympathetic for him. Not to mention that badass booming voice that can make ordering a pizza sound threatening.This was not only the beginning of the best movie series ever, but it was the beginning of my love for movies. George Lucas is a genius for being able to come up with a great story and an incredible backdrop for what was supposed to be a flop, but turned into one of the best films ever. 10/10","

"bkoganbing","20 September 2010","The awesome special effects and the creation of creatures that are part of the vivid imagination of George Lucas are not the reason for the enduring popularity of Star Wars and the franchise it spawned. Rather it is because of the characters Lucas created that will live as long as we have cinema and the means to display it.The spectacle is behind some real, but simple people. No shadings of gray in the first Star Wars we know without any doubt who the heroes and villains are of this piece. On an isolated planet a galaxy wide dictatorship called the Empire and the revolt against come to wear young Luke Skywalker as played by Mark Hamill and his family reside. So does Alec Guinness, a reclusive and mysterious hermit. An escape pod crashes there with two androids, C3PO and R2D2 and in the latter is a message for Guinness who was at one time a Jedi Knight, fiercest of a warrior class, from Carrie Fisher playing Princess Leia. Also in R2D2 are the schematics for the Empire's ultimate weapon the satellite size death star that can deal killing out on a planetary scale. This starts an adventure with young Hamill who teams up with futuristic soldier of fortune Harrison Ford as Han Solo and his simian like sidekick Chewbacca to rescue the Princess and defeat the Death Star.Those are the good guys. The bad guys are the blackest of black villainy. Peter Cushing cold bloodedly commands the Death Star, but the mysterious Darth Vader, clad in black with a helmet completely covering his head, has mysterious powers and even his superiors are wary of him. The voice of James Earl Jones is unforgettable as the black prince of the galaxy.These are characters that bring out the kid in all of us. The ones who claim the most sophistication in their lives will cheer on for Hamill and Ford and will be fascinated by the double dyed villainy of Darth Vader.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Star Wars and I speak now of all the films is the way such non-humans as the robots and Chewbacca the Wookie became characters. C3PO had dialog, but R2D2 had a few clicks and bleeks and all Chewbacca did was grunt, still they became as identifiable as the human characters.Star Wars set the standard for science fiction films to come for the next several generations. It was given six Oscars in a bunch of technical categories and it's got a re-release value that Gone With The Wind used to have.The Force Will Be With Us Always.","

"Tweekums","6 October 2008","When I first watched this in the cinema I was ten, it was 1977 and I'd never seen anything like it. It had me gripped from the start when a small spacecraft flew past being fired upon by another much larger one that was so big that it seemed to take ages to pass over the viewer. Unlike the recent prequels scenes such as this weren't cluttered with excessive CGI activity but instead showed what was needed in a way that hadn't been seen before. The special effects used throughout the film were ground-breaking for the time and still look great to this day, there is something more real looking about the models used when compared to today's CGI.The main character are all interesting and likable and the acting was all pretty good both from veteran actors like Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing who brought a suitable gravitas to the film and from younger actors Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher who brought a sense of youthful energy.In the unlikely event that somebody doesn't know what the film is about I'll give a brief synopsis; Set in a distant galaxy the forces of the evil galactic empire are hunting down the rebels who are attempting to restore the old republic. They are about to capture a rebel ship which has the stolen plans to the empires latest weapon, the Death Star, when they are hidden in a small robot (droid) by the name of R2-D2 by Princess Leah, he escapes in one of the ships escape pods along with his companion C3PO. They escape to the desert world of Tatooine where they are swiftly captured by strange creatures called Jawas who sell the pair to a farmer who gets his nephew Luke to clean them. While doing so he stumbles across a holographic message addressed to one Obi-Wan Kenobi. While Luke is off having his dinner R2-D2 escapes seeking Obi Wan.The next day Luke sets off to find him but shortly after doing so he is ambushed by Sand People who start ransacking his vehicle till they are disturbed by a robed figure who turns out to be Obi-Wan. He explains to Luke that he was once a Jedi knight and friend of his late father who had been killed by another Jedi called Darth Vader who had turned to the dark side of the force, they also see the full message that R2 is carrying which requests that Obi-Wan takes R2 to the planet Alderaan to get the plans to the rebels. While this is happening Vader who is on the ship searching for the plans dispatches troops to search for the two missing droids. By the time Luke returns home it is too late, the place is a burn out ruin and his aunt and uncle are dead. He decides that he will join Obi-Wan on his mission to Alderaan.They hire a ship, called the Millennium Falcon, from a smuggler called Han Solo who needs the money to pay off a debt and avoid the various bounty hunter who are after him. When they arrive at Alderaan they find it is no longer there, it has in fact been destroyed by the Death Star in an attempt to get Princess Leah to tell them where the rebels are based. Soon after arriving the Millennium Falcon is captured after it goes to investigate a small moon that turns out to be the Death Star. While Obi-Wan is off trying to disable the tractor beam that captured them Han and Luke discover that Princess Leah is being held in the detention area and set off to rescue her... I won't say any more as I don't want to spoil the ending.I think this is a film every body should see at least once, it might not be perfect but if it wasn't for this recent cinematic history would be quite different; it kick-started a revival in science fiction that lead to things like Battlestar Galactica, the return of Star Trek and Alien and was possibly the first ""block-buster"" film. In many ways it was more than just a film it was an event; everybody at my school was talking about it and little else, till one watched it you were completely out of the loop. The characters and there adventures in this and the other films in the franchise have become part of modern folklore.These comments were made based on the video released in the '80s... so no extra CGI and Greedo didn't even attempt to fire before Han killed him.","

"MaxBorg89","15 November 2005","This great classic has so many good elements it's almost impossible to list them all: The breathtaking visual effects, still awesome 28 years on; the brilliant script, which mixed epic battles and duels with matinée-serial-style characters and dialogues; the debut of one of the greatest villains in cinema history, Darth Vader; John Williams'amazing and unforgettable score, among the Top 10 best scores ever...All those things are just some of the reasons Star Wars is among the best movies (not just sci-fi) ever made: viewing after viewing, it never stops being impressive, and words are nearly useless to describe the impact it still has on the audience.George Lucas basically took a medieval story and moved it to a distant galaxy, on weird and fascinating planets. Almost everything is taken from the Middle Ages: there are knights, sword-fighting, evil Empires, unsatisfied people who want to overthrow the system, beautiful princesses waiting to be rescued...Then we've also got speeders, light-sabers, peculiar (and, in the case of Jabba the Hutt, disgusting) creatures, the Death Star, and of course the Force, that fascinating energy which is supposed to bring balance to the galaxy.The cast is a gas, both the newcomers and the veterans: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford are great as Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo (Ford in particular is hilarious as the arrogant but ultimately nice ""scoundrel""), but the most memorable performance is of course Alec Guinness'portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi, the old, wise Jedi who returns one last time to initiate Luke to the mysteries of the Force.But let's not forget what everybody immediately thinks of when Star Wars is mentioned: Darth Vader. Feared by his opponents as well as his servants, this completely emotionless foe has become the very symbol of Lucas'masterpiece. He's one of those movie-characters people will remember as long as films will keep being made and his unsettling breathing noise still echoes in our memories...The beginning of a wonderful saga, whose only rival is The Lord of the Rings.May the Force be with you...","

"SnoopyStyle","29 September 2013","This story happened 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away'. The galaxy is under the dictatorship of the emperor. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is part of the rebellion but is capture by the evil Darth Vader. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the young hero, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) the brigand, his sidekick Chewbacca, and the wise master Jedi Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) must together rescue the princess and save the galaxy.The characters are icons pulled from classic storytelling like Akira Kurosawa's ""The Hidden Fortress"". George Lucas was able to assemble such iconic characters into a well told story. Rarely is a movie change the nature of movie-making, and even the wider culture. This may be on the list of the most important movie ever. It changed the tone of movies from the gritty morally-confused 70s to the popcorn selling blockbusters that are soon to come.","

"owenmul","27 March 2015","Star Wars is simply a fantastic film, on every level this film is amazing.Each of the characters in this film are so well developed and so interesting that you just cannot wait for the next scene with them in it, the interactions between the characters us at times tense and at times downright hilarious, leaving no room for boring or lacking dialogue. The particular stand outs in this respect I feel are: Han Solo, the wise cracking bounty hunter with a tendency for arrogance that makes every scene as entertaining as possible. Secondly there is Darth Vader, who is the optometry of cool, scathing evil who poses as the ultimate villain.Surprising to me, the cinematography and special effects have held up all this time. Although there are some minor issues, one particularly notable one is during the scene where Luke is training with the training droid aboard the Millennium Falcon there are a few frame skips where Luke extends and contracts his lightsaber. Other than this though, the cinematography and special effects are amazing to have held up, particularly the shots of the Empire's space fleet moving through space which are absolutely stunning.One of the things that absolutely makes this film for me is the magnificent score, composed by John Williams. This score, while being one of the most iconic scores of all time, manages to make every single scene, fitting the mood of the scene perfectly.The story as well is fantastic, there is never a dull moment; every second of it an absolute thrill ride. Whether its the attack on the Death Star or the Cantina of Mos Eisley the story takes you through the twists and turns of this classic space opera.If I could recommend one sci-fi adventure film to someone, it would be this, it's an absolute must see.More Reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/","

"ShadeGrenade","9 May 2008","This is not a review of the first ( and best ) 'Star Wars' movie. I take it, fellow I.M.D.B. users, that you are already familiar with the plot, characters and production history, and how its success changed the face of cinema overnight. So rather than rehash all the known facts, I want instead to recount a personal memory.I first learnt of 'Star Wars' thanks to Granada's 'The Krypton Factor', a long-running game show designed to test contestants' intelligence, physical fitness, powers of observation and so on. I liked the latter round as it often gave one a chance to catch a sneak preview of a new movie. One week, they ran a clip of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, R2D2 and C2PO escaping The Death Star in The Millennium Falcon, and being shot at by pursuing T.I.E. fighters. I fell off my chair. What was this? 1970's sci-fi movies were mostly depressing affairs, predicting gloomy futures for Mankind, now here was something fast, colourful, and lively, with lasers zapping about outer space and explosions. Right up my street.I had to see it. But the film was not yet on release here. There was no Internet then so I got my movie information from the local paper. I kept checking for news of an impending screening at my local cinema, but no - there was nothing. I began to wonder if the movie actually existed or not. Had Granada pulled off the greatest hoax of all time? I read the Sphere book voraciously until I knew the story backwards. I played the Meco disco single at every opportunity. When Marvel's comic adaptation went on sale, I was almost thrown out of the newsagent for jumping up and down for sheer joy.At my school, 'Star Wars' was a dirty word to sci-fi fans, mainly because it was not 'Close Encounters'. The Spielberg picture was regarded as 'adult' and 'intelligent', while the Lucas movie was deemed 'kiddie stuff' starring weirdos in fancy dress running around with a bloke dressed as a big teddy bear.The wait dragged on and on. In an episode of 'Coronation Street', Gail ( Helen Worth ) asked her then-boyfriend, Steve Fisher: ""When's 'Star Wars' coming round here?"" to which he replied: ""It'll be some time I expect."". His words encapsulated the sheer frustration and impatience felt by all us U.K. fans. The highest grossing film of all time and we can't see it? What is the hold up? Are they redoing bits for the benefit of British audiences? Peter Cushing and Alec Guinness are in it so this cannot be right.In desperation, I told a blatant lie to my best friend. ""I have seen 'Star Wars'"", I proclaimed. He looked about as shocked as if I'd said I'd spent the night with Carrie Fisher. I claimed that my uncle Eric worked for Twentieth Century-Fox ( another lie. He drove taxi cabs for a living ) as an assistant editor and George Lucas had been so impressed with his work on the film, he had generously given him a print. To back up my claim, I reeled off a long list of plot details and scene descriptions. I got a few things wrong, such as Jabba The Hut and Biggs Darklighter, both of whom were excised from the final cut. But by the time my friend saw the film he had forgotten these. He did beg me to ask my uncle to run the film specially for him on Sunday afternoon, but I deflected this by stating that Uncle Eric's projector had broken down. He never asked again.Being about fifteen, I was too old for the toys, hence on Christmas Day 1977 I was denied the pleasure of reenacting the assault on The Death Star in my garden shed, with the aid of elastic bands, old Subbuteo figures and the John Williams soundtrack thumping out of my Hitachi tape recorder.After what felt like an eternity, the movie finally opened here and suddenly it became fashionable to denounce it as 'overrated'. 'It was childish when they were playing trumpets in the Cantina' was my best friend's verdict. That was all he had to say on the subject ( he would have made a great film critic! ). Many people felt that the film had not been worth the six month wait. I was one of the few to speak in its defence. I was glad that sci-fi movies were fun again. Nobody left the theatre with a spring in their step after seeing Milo The Baby Chimp's parents brutally murdered by the U.S. Government at the end of 'Escape From The Planet Of The Apes'.'Star Wars' spawned two sequels, neither as good, and inspired the likes of 'Alien', 'The Black Hole', 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' and countless others. Without Lucas, these would simply not have been made.I am not a big fan of the prequels, but then I'm not young anymore, so can't enjoy that kind of movie in the same way. 'Star Wars' brought 'A New Hope' to those of us wanting old fashioned escapism on the Silver Screen again. I envy kids today for not having to wait until winter for the latest summer blockbuster.","

"Prichards12345","22 May 2006","I first saw this film on a warm March Sunday evening in 1978, after queueing for a whole hour to get into the cinema. Oh, the anticipation! The excitement! The magic! And here was a film that changed the whole concept of cinema forever, for no matter how many times I return to it, in the flickering dark of the cinema, or the wondrous, glittering DVD release, or in where the film really scores - at the centre of my imagination, that night will live forever in my memory. ANYTHING was possible, wonders could be achieved. Miracles in the here and now. And how lucky I was to share in it.To the squares that loathe it - I pity you daddyos; you'll never experience what millions of us have felt these past three decades. Go and see Henry Jaglom again; I'll stick with Mr. Lucas - he is THE MAN!I love this film. Forget what flaws it has - minor they are indeed. Star Wars has become a mystic myth and that sorcerer supreme, Jedi master George Lucas, has given me more pleasure than I can measure. My favourite bit? Almost impossible to choose. Okay, if I must...the stunning Tie Fighter battle with the Millennium Falcon, a work or art in the editing room. It should be hung on a wall somewhere.George, old chap, if you're ever passing my house please knock - and I'll make you a cup of tea. You deserve that much at least!","

"Marx_Bros_Fan86","21 February 2007","Star Wars seems to lack the sense of importance that all of the sequels and prequels had. This one just seeks to entertain, and there's nothing wrong with that! Star Wars is one of those miracle movies (a term borrowed from Leonard Maltin) where everything went wrong but it all came together in the end, like Jaws and The Wizard of Oz. The movie was plagued by budget problems, and Lucas was so behind schedule he suffered a few panic attacks, which is probably why he did not direct the sequels. Star Wars takes the audience on a series of adventures, from encountering sand people in the desert to rescuing a princess on a space station. The special effects and production design is amazing. It takes you into a whole new galaxy and makes you believe it's real. I liked how everything looked old and dirty; prior to Star Wars everything in Sci-fi movies looked brand new. John William's Star Wars score adds a whole new element of fun and is arguably the best work of his career. I can't imagine what Star Wars would be like without his music.The main characters are all familiar archetypes. Luke is the restless, immature boy who wants to get off the farm and have an adventure. Han Solo is the rugged pirate who only cares for himself. Harrison Ford really steals every scene he's in with his wise guy attitude. Obi-Wan Kenobi is the Sorcerer/Mentor stereotype, like Merlin. Alec Guinness brings a certain classiness to the role, even though this is not even close to his best performance. His final lightsaber battle is slow and boring due to the limitations of the weak lightsabers (David Prowse kept breaking them!) and his old age, but he delivers his verbal quips quite nicely, as does James Earl Jones. The scene where he dies is still very powerful; I love how Vader steps on his empty robe, it's like he's thinking ""hey, where are you hiding?"" Carrie Fisher plays the kidnapped princess; her performance is tougher and feistier in this movie. She loses those qualities to a certain extent in the following movies.Hammer Horror film veteran Peter Cushing played the sinister Imperial Officer, Grand Moff Tarkin. It's amazing how Cushing was able to slip into the role of the villain so easily (he certainly looks evil), considering the fact he was most famous for playing protagonists like Van Helsing and Dr. Frankenstein. I cannot give enough praise to James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader, one of the greatest villains of all time. Some of the dialog is embarrassing but the cast was able to bring the characters alive. That is the most important difference between the originals and the prequels. These characters were not complex in any way, but they had good chemistry with each other. The prequel's characters felt like cardboard. I used to think this was the most boring Star Wars film, and I just don't understand why anymore. I've noticed this film gets criticized for bad pacing, and I could not disagree more. Star Wars has the best pacing of the original trilogy. Empire's plot stopped moving in the middle of the movie, and the first 35-40 minutes of Jedi were a total pit stop. Star Wars on the other hand smoothly builds up to the final climax at the Death Star, without any long story lags. The Battle of Yavin has been criticized for being too long (by Alec Guinness and Roger Ebert), but I don't mind. The Death Star's destruction is an exhilarating moment. Star Wars is also the funniest movie in the series. The bickering between the three heroes on the Death Star is hilarious.In 2004 the Star Wars movies were revised yet again for the DVD release. I have to say I'm disappointed with how the original trilogy has been treated by Lucas. He seems to support film preservation in every case, except when it comes to his own movies. To me, replacing actors and revising special effects is just as bad as colorizing a black and white movie. It eliminates all of the historical significance. I hope one day the original trilogy will receive better treatment in the future. I would recommend buying the original trilogy on DVD now while you still can. It might not be released again, but with Lucas you can never tell.","

"hitchcockthelegend","29 March 2009","Princess Leia is captured and held hostage by the Imperial Army as it seeks to rule the Galactic Empire. An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi may just be hers, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it.Back in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day.As the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not, because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here), it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach, and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox's historic blockbuster didn't run with the baton, in fact most pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment.It is by definition one of the most successful films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn't know it at the time, but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn't just make a movie, he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas' baby. Ultimately, though, it's one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it's that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it's an event that is like hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10","

"Horst_In_Translation","2 November 2015","""Star Wars"" is a 2-hour science fiction movie from almost 30 years ago written and directed by George Lucas. There really needs nothing to be said about how good this is for a 1970s movie, especially in terms of technical aspects. The Academy certainly got it right by giving them all these Oscars for it. However, it lacks in certain other areas unfortunately. First of all, the acting isn't too great. That is not really a problem of the characters though, but rather of the way they were written, which simply offered no room for outstanding performances. And Peter Cushing's character was downright forgettable despite being the main antagonist. Instead people remember Darth Vader obviously. Why? Because this film is all about the way the characters look and not what they do or say. A bit style over substance. Apart from that, I am quite surprised Alec Guinness scored an Academy Award nomination for his turn here.The script is not the greatest achievement in general. It's the usual black-and-white characterization with good vs evil and the characters have no real shades, no facets. This was made up again by the strong work in other departments as it's not too memorable what they say and do, but what they look like, especially the non-human characters who are all somewhat considered legendary today. I am not saying the characters are written badly. Not at all. But it's just other contributions that made them what they are today. Not the script. And while I enjoyed most of the film, I cannot see it as an epic or a cult classic as so many people do to this date. ""Star Wars"" is bound to rise again with the new film coming out soon and featuring the original cast again. It should be interesting what they make out of it. Until then, feel free to watch the old films like this one, but not too many. The very first Star Wars film here is not a great achievement in terms of story, only in terms of all visual and audible aspects.","

"disdressed12","22 February 2007","what can you say about his movie.it set the bar by which all movies to come would be judged,and this was 1977.i'm talking about the visual effects,which were nothing less than astounding.it still stands up well to any movie in that regard.remember,they didn't have the benefit of CGI back then,so they relied on miniatures.when you add to that,a compelling story and a soon to be iconic villain(not to mention,the colourful cast of characters)and you have box office gold.sure,the dialogue may be wooden and stilted at times,but that is overshadowed by the achievement of the film.Besides,the film was marketed at 12 year olds,so they're not gonna care about stupid things like dialogue.The original ""Star Wars"" or as it is subtitled ""a New Hope,was a landmark film and single handedly reinvented the science fiction genre. Obviously 10/10","

"masonsaul","16 December 2019","Star Wars (A New Hope) is a near perfect sci-fi adventure that's incredibly bold, original and extremely entertaining. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Anthony Daniels and Carrie Fisher all give incredible performances. James Earl Jones is fantastic as Darth Vader, one of the best villains of all time. Alec Guinness gives a great supporting performance. The visual effects are stunning and still look really good. It's extremely well paced and genuinely thrilling throughout with excellent action sequences and space battles. The music by John Williams is perfect as well as George Lucas's direction as the film is beautifully filmed.","

"bob the moo","30 June 2002","The Republic has fallen and the Empire rules the galaxy as a dictatorship, seeking to destroy dissenting voices.  The Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, is fully on line and capable of destroying whole systems.  The Jedi have been destroyed, save a few living in hiding, unable to compete with the force of the Empire.  However Princess Leia has the plans showing a weakness within the Death Star.  Before she is captured by Darth Vader she gives them to droids C3PO and R2D2 and they escape.  When they land on a nearby planet they find Luke Skywalker and set out to find the owner of the droids Obi Wan Kenobi, or Old Ben Kenobi.  Obi Wan begins to train Luke in the way of the force as they try to get the information to the Rebellion before the Death Star can be used at full power.It's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking  lets be honest, Lucas isn't the Shakespeare of our generation.  However what it is, is a good story of good v's evil, a western of goodies v baddies set in space.  The story is simple but contains clear characters.  The thing that sets it apart is the fun  the sense of wonder for kids but also the enjoyment it brings to adult. The story is good for a sci-fi with a lot of history and back-story clearly set out up front.  The action scenes are mostly great  not dry effects but with a real sense of action and excitement too.This may be the 4th part but it's also our first chapter, it is light and enjoyable but hints that this is only part of an ongoing battle.  The way it relates to kids and adults is obvious as it broke records and everyone of a certain age knows about Star Wars!  The effects still look good today  in many ways the model work looks better than all digital effects simply because they are `real' and don't just exist within a computer.  Sound effects, comedy, music  it's all pitch perfect and sets up the rest of the series really well.Hamil is ok as Skywalker (`Blonde hair, blue eyes'  Chasing Amy!).  He is suitable for a kids film and he does well with his role.  However like part 1 has Anakin at his least interesting, part 4 has Luke yet to develop into darker areas.  Ford is perfect as Han Solo  he adds character and flair to some dry performances.  Alec Guinness adds maturity to the whole film and is so good is Obi Wan that even Ewan McGregor just does an impression rather than recreate the role.  Darth Vader is just the right side of silly camp villain, Jones' voice is a perfect fit and he has real menace and power. Bits players such as Chewie, C3PO, R2D2 etc all add comedy in spades.Overall this film is even better now that we know how it all fits together in Star Wars `history'.  But even without all the hype this is a really fun sci-fi that is enjoyable, simple and really good fun to watch if you're in the mood.  Having a deeper perspective on it just makes it all the better.","

"classicsoncall","6 June 2007","I couldn't let the thirtieth anniversary season of ""Star Wars"" slip by without a commemorative viewing today to remind me of the start of this hugely successful franchise. Though it's not one of my own personal Top Ten films of all time, I can understand how so many fans come to see it that way. At the time it was a seminal film that reinvigorated the sci-fi genre; my first viewing when it debuted in theaters garnered more than a single 'Whoa' with each new scene and concept that hadn't been done before. I was particularly intrigued with the names of the characters George Lucas created for his heroes, sounding uniquely original and matching their physical description and characters. Could Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, or Princess Leia have been called anything else? How about Jabba the Hutt; he looks exactly how a Jabba the Hutt would look if there was a Jabba the Hutt. Makes sense, doesn't it? I get a kick out of the nay sayers on this board who have such a fierce guttural reaction to the success of the entire Star Wars franchise, never missing an opportunity to thrash it unmercifully. The best response to that I guess would be that they represent a mere six and a half per cent minority of the IMDb voting history for this film that give it less than a 6.0 rating. It reminds me of that joke about the one in three people who might be crazy, and your two best friends seem alright. Something to think about.Anyway, there's no point in detailing the film since virtually every one on the planet has probably seen it at least once, even my wife. My son, who was born in 1977, has probably seen it thirty times a year every year since he started watching movies, kind of a record in itself I would think, allowing him to quote virtually every line of dialog from the movie. Such is the compelling nature of true Star Wars fans, who while watching, find themselves in a galaxy far, far away.","

She assigns the droid to deliver the plans to Obi-Wan Kenobi with a message to give the plans to the rebels. R2-D2 flees to the Planet Tatooine with his fellow C-3PO in a space pod and land on the desert, but they are captured by Jawa traders. They are sold to Owen Lars (Phil Brown) and when his nephew Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is cleaning the droid, he accidentally activates part of the message and he wonders whether it would be addressed to the old Ben Kenobi. On the next morning, Luke discovers that R2-D2 is seeking out Obi-Wan Kenobi and he goes after him with C-3PO. They are attacked by the Tusken Raiders and saved by a drifter, who is Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that tells part of his past as Jedi to Luke. He also tells that his father was a Jedi Knight and gives a light-saber that belonged to his father to Luke. Obi-Wan invites Luke to travel with him to Alderaan and when he finds that his family was killed by the Imperial soldiers, he decides to join Obi-Wan in his quest. They head to Mos Esley to hire a skilled pilot and they team-up with the smugglers Han-Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Meanwhile the evil Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) orders to destroy the planet Alderaan to show the power of the Death Star to Leia and the rebels. Obi-Wan feels the impact in the Force and when the Millennium Falcon arrives at the destination, the group finds only debris. Further, a tractor beam pulls the spacecraft to the Death Star. What will happen to the group and Princess Leia? Will they succeed in delivering the information to the rebels?""Star Wars"", later retitled ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is the unforgettable and charming sci-fi adventure that surprised the world in 1977. The strategy of George Lucas that claimed that there was no technology available to the cinema industry in 1977 to produce the three first chapters was part of a marketing strategy that kept alive the interest of fans fro the whole six chapters, In sequence, great part of the mystery would not have raised. All the films are engaging, but none of them can beat this one rated #19 in IMDb. Harrison Ford in the top of his career and the cast show a wonderful chemistry. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Star Wars: Episódio IV – Uma Nova Esperança"" (Blu-Ray) (""Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope"")","

It is indeed a product of its time and would have fascinated many kids of the era. As a film it is very simple and easy to follow. There are no big twists, dilemmas and the good forces come on top. The special effects and film have definitely aged but it has some classic elements. Darth Vader, the army of storm troopers and the mighty light saber is unlikely to be forgotten. Star Wars as a franchise clearly benefited from coming out at the right time, this was the day before competitive television, streaming services or films like Inception. The immortality of Star Wars lies in its simplicity, linear story and vast imagination. This appealed to millions of kids who grew into adults who still loved identified their childhood with this series.","

"Med-Jasta","12 April 2020","Who would have thought that an experimental director would have had to resurrect classic hero story telling? Well, that's where they were in the 70s. And Lucas did it with such perfection. He did his research and he cared. And most importantly he was trusted to make the movie that he wanted.A New Hope is the greatest successes story in Hollywood not only because it changed movies and made a lot of money and continues to touch people to this day. But because nobody believed in Lucas. Alan Ladd Jr at Fox and Mark Hamill were about it. Not only that but this production had everything go wrong with it. It was literally against all odds from everyone including the studio. Then it was a smash hit of unheard of proportions.Once a teacher of mine asked if movies were more than movies. And he said, ""look at Star Wars, yes they are."" And he wasn't even a fan. This is more than a movie because it speaks to people in a way that can't be described. They've tried but no one can. It's something that you feel because Lucas updated the hero myth. He took what worked in stories from all around the world since the dawn of time and made it his own.And he's really good at making movies. I think really the biggest contribution to movies overall isn't the special effects and the return to good versus evil storytelling. It's that Lucas really cares about how quickly the movie flows. He doesn't keep things that hang and everything is always moving. Movies became much faster after this. Because Lucas really focused on the pace and feel.Out of all 6 movies this one can stand
alone, as it was intended, well not intended but it was equipped to be one movie. As a fan this was always the worse of the original 3 because the next two were better. But when I got older and saw the movie proceeding this I understood it. After the French Connection and Dirty Harry and The Godfather and so many others, which are all good but I finally saw why Lucas wanted to make this. And the movie clicked for me and I loved it much more. Fun, simple, fast and good vs evil.This movie really does everything right. Every time I watch it I'm excited and laugh at every joke. It's an uplifting movie that many have tried to duplicate and are either too much of this or that.We talk about the influences for this but that's not what makes it so good, it's Lucas. While themes and motifs are taken from other sources there really isn't anything that is directly from something else. He took those ideas and made them his own. He knew how far to go, where to stop. Because Lucas has always shown restraint.I wonder what people will think when they watch them in Episode order? Where's the Emperor? Where's Yoda? Who are all these new people? Why is Vader hardly in it?Anakin is now pathetic. He always was but we never realized it. Grand Moff Tarkin is his boss. Vader takes orders from him. He is just doing what the Emperor tells him to do. It's funny that he became such a pop culture icon of evil. That was never the intention. I love James Earl Jones voice in this one because it's much more angry and sinister that the other two.I love when Wedge blows up the Tie then flies through the flames. I'm glad Lucas changed this for the special edition because I was always confused as a kid there.The music... My God the music! John Williams is always great and all 6 are great but this one in particular is the best. Especially during the last fight. Just think of it with other music and it's totally different.3p0 and R2 bickering is so funny. And Alec Guinness really helps bring weight to the history in the movie. Something about his warm presence really adds a lot to the movie. He makes it so seem real.But I have to say my favorite scene and I don't know why. Maybe because you can boil Star Wars down to this one moment. Is when Luke and Leah swing across the chasm. The music, the guy holding the girl, the adventure, the romance... Something about it gets me every time.As a kid Star Wars was dead. I was born in 85 and that was the lowest year of Star Wars popularity. So this wasn't shoved in my face. My dad showed me the movies because they were PG. There were no adds, none of my friends were into it. But I loved it and was obsessed. No influence from any where. That shows you the effect it has on a kid. It did in 77 all the way till now and it will forever.Lucas made something that speaks to not only kids but the kid in all of us. I can't tell you how many times I site star wars to distinguish between right and wrong. And my lessons haven't stopped, they continue with age. Lucas is the Midi-chlorian that shows us the force/this side of ourselves. I really wonder where the world would be without Star Wars","

"ametaphysicalshark","4 November 2008","I was never a ""Star Wars"" guy growing up. I wouldn't say that I was a ""Star Trek"" guy growing up either (""Doctor Who"" was my sci-fi franchise of choice growing up, and still is, even though I'm not a big fan of Russell T. Davies' version of the show), but I would definitely choose my favorite episodes of the original series or ""Deep Space 9"", ""The Wrath of Khan"", and ""The Undiscovered Country"" over any ""Star Wars"" film. I've seen the original trilogy a couple of times previously, once as a kid, once in my mid-teens, and now I sit down to watch ""Star Wars"" again, having been inspired by catching half of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" on TV recently and being enthralled by it.The first thing that struck me is how great the opening shot is, just after the scrolling text that is. The rest of the movie was pretty much how I remembered it being- a collection of great set-pieces and memorable characters, and a great mythology, but with a story which wasn't nearly as grand and great as ""The Empire Strikes Back"". Although a point of criticism aimed at ""Star Wars"" by its (relatively few) detractors is that it doesn't quite match the real feel of a 30's/40's serial, I think that it really does, and not only in the way it is shot and the transitional wipes and all that, but in the writing, the acting, and just about everything else. It has that same sense of adventure, and although this particular film is nowhere near as good as some of my favorite serials, it remains something which very accurately captures the feel of watching one of those, and its popularity (and the popularity of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") is hence quite understandable, as very few of even the big summer blockbusters have the same sensibility and sense of adventure, and well, fun.Watching ""Star Wars"", in spite of it not being my favorite of the original trilogy, serves as a reminder of the talent which George Lucas had at one point. I don't think this film is as good as his previous effort, ""American Graffiti"", which is the greatest 'coming of age' film I've ever seen, and one of the most beautiful films ever made from a visual standpoint, but it's still got spirit and energy which his later efforts just don't. It's quite sad, really. There's really nothing I can say that hasn't been said already (which is true, certainly of many popular films, but this is freakin' ""Star Wars"", so trust me, I have NOTHING to add to what has already been said). There are ""Star Wars"" devotees who swear it is the greatest of the trilogy and one of the best movies ever made, there are detractors who think it's cheesy nonsense, and then there are others like me who like it quite a bit, but aren't sure where all the extravagant praise comes from. ""The Empire Strikes Back""... Well, that's a whole other story.8/10","

"saveliydalmatov","30 December 2023","The beginning of one of the most legendary franchises with one of the most elaborate worlds in the history of cinema.There is no denying, even if you are not a fan of this franchise, the contribution to cinema that this film has made.A charming and memorable soundtrack combined with strong and soulful scenes gives a wow effect.It is this movie that includes a huge number of events that capture you and immerse you in history. The powerful and dramatic first half, contrasting with the cheerful and humorous second, gives a very complete and versatile film.Characters - there's nothing to say here. Darth Vader - who can compete with him in popularity among villains except the Joker? The ""kind"" characters of the film - Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Han Solo and others - are known to almost everyone. And for good reason!Yes, the graphics here are still a bit weak, but after such thoughts, look at the release date - 1977, and then remember the atmosphere and elaboration of this picture and think about whether you gave the right claims to this story?And the same ""old"" special effects are still very cool for those years and the eyes are not too sore.The only thing is that because of the possibilities of that time, Darth Vader does not look as cool as in new films and animations, and fights on light swords not best. But, unfortunately, these were the conditions before.George Lucas came up with an interesting idea - to start the franchise with the 4th film. But there were conditions for that - filming the first three episodes was impossible at that time.In general, this is the beginning of a great saga that is worth watching, it is not for nothing that it is considered a classic and revered by more than one generation.My rating is 9/10. Great!","

"BA_Harrison","25 February 2007","There was no way my review of this classic slab of pulp sci-fi was ever going to be anything but glowing; as a nine year old I saw George Lucas' space opera on its original release and instantly became one of a legion of fans who spent the next twenty years worshipping at the altar of the great turkey-necked director (until The Phantom Menace shattered all of my illusions).Thirty years on, and I'm revisiting Star Wars with my two children, hoping that they will fall in love with it as much as I did, way back when all that seemed important was having a bag-full of marbles and a decent sized pile of comics to read.I'm not going to describe the plot (surely you know that!), nor am I going to go into great detail about how Lucas borrowed elements from the movies he loved to bring us his epic about a farm boy who becomes a legendary warrior; all I can say is that the film has lost none of its ability to astound and my kids sat entranced (despite not being able to follow the story without the benefit of some additional info from their sci-fi geek dad). My son (who is only three and a half ) might not understand what a 'rebellion' is, and my daughter (nearly six) may struggle with the concept of 'the force', but both got a kick from witnessing the whole Star Wars universe for the very first time.Chewbacca was an instant hit with my boy, whereas my girl identified with Leia, the gutsy princess. Both of them loved the brilliantly realised landscapes, aliens, robots and spaceships that have wowed film-fans for three decades (and who can blame themthe attention to detail and sheer creativity in design, costume, and make-up is staggering).It has since become evident that old George ain't always the greatest writer or director in the world (the last three Star Wars movies are proof of that); however, when he does get it right, he works miracles (he wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark tooanother solid gold movie).Star Wars is perfect family entertainment that delivers amazing spectacle, unforgettable characters and enough movie magic to last a lifetime. In fact, why not do yourself a favour: get off the internet and go watch it right now (even if you have seen it hundreds of times before).","

"hall895","25 May 2005","A classic story with a perfect cast, memorable score and dazzling special effects. Movies don't get any better than this. More space opera than true sci-fi, Star Wars takes you on a magical ride through a galaxy far, far away.The first moment of genius comes right at the very start with a written crawl which gives a basic plot outline and without which all that immediately followed would be hard to place in context. After John Williams' now legendary opening theme we are thrust into the first of many thrilling space battles to come. Almost immediately we are introduced to one of the great movie villains of all time, Darth Vader who is voiced with true menace by James Earl Jones, and it becomes clear that this film is not quite like anything we have seen before.Star Wars may seem to be your typical good versus evil swashbuckling adventure but there's a lot more going on here. The hero, Luke Skywalker, is your typical simple, clean-cut farm boy who will soon be thrust into the middle of a galactic war of as grand a scale as could be imagined. But he is not our only hero. Princess Leia, a leader of the rebellion against the evil Galactic Empire, is certainly not your typical helpless fairy-tale princess. She gives as good as she gets. Obi-Wan Kenobi is the older, wiser more seasoned hero and the mentor young Luke will desperately need. Han Solo is a space pirate in it only for the money, not for any revolution. Solo's first mate aboard his ship, the Milennium Falcon, is Chewbacca, a giant Wookiee who is remarkably adept at space flight for a creature which resembles a hairy two-legged dog. Also along for the ride to help our heroes are the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 who provide not only critical help for our heroes but some comic relief for the audience.The performances in Star Wars are all first-rate. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker plays the young, naive Skywalker very well and Hamill grows right along with the character throughout the film. Carrie Fisher brings the appropriate smarts, skills, sophistication and determination to Princess Leia. Without Fisher's quality performance it might be hard to believe that this young woman could play such a pivotal role in a rebellion of this magnitude. Alec Guinness is reliably brilliant as old Jedi master Kenobi. He is mysterious, quiet and reserved yet very strong indeed. Stealing the show is Harrison Ford as Han Solo. It seems Ford gets all the best lines and he makes the most of them. Luke Skywalker may be the nominal hero of the film but it is Ford as Solo from which Star Wars gets most of its personality.George Lucas has crafted a true masterpiece here. The classic struggle of the underdog against the evil oppressor takes on many new twists here. The mysterious Force, the foreboding and menacing Darth Vader, alien creatures of all imaginable shapes and sizes, the epic nature of a battle which rages across an entire galaxy...in the end it all comes together to form something unique and truly wonderful. With action and adventure on a grand scale, fascinating characters on both sides of the fight, special effects that were revolutionary for the time and an ever-building sense of drama and excitement Star Wars is an absolute triumph.","

"itamarscomix","24 September 2011","Before there was a trilogy, before there were prequels, before there was an expanded universe with hundreds of books, comics and video games, before Greedo shot first and before Jar Jar Bink was a speck of light in George Lucas' eye, there was Star Wars. Even if it's not the best film in the series (it's not), Star Wars deserves its own place in the history of cinema, as a work that changed Hollywood forever. It brought back the grandness of the epic cinema of the 30's and 40's and multiplied it, creating a new era of spectacle and excitement.Unlike the rest of the films, there's absolutely no need for an expanded universe or a complete saga to appreciate the original Star Wars by its own right. It's a complete tale, a classic saga that takes its queues from historical epics, samurai films and serials, and contains every aspect of the timeless hero's journey. The fact that it takes place 'in a galaxy far, far away' is trivial - though it did help the film have a bigger impact.Star Wars has very little to do with science fiction; not much of the science in it makes any sense, it might as well be magic. But that's what made it so powerful, and what made the prequels - that tried to explain everything away - so disappointing. Luke Skywalker's story is a classic story of the simple farm-boy who leaves his home and becomes a hero, and for that reason exactly it's timeless, and resonates with audiences even now.Now go see The Empire Strikes Back.","

"AlsExGal","11 July 2015","The latest TCM production entitled TCM Presents A Night at the Movies: George Lucas & The World of Fantasy Cinema, was really 2/3 about Lucas's films and it seemed that 2/3 of that was about Star Wars - but that was OK because it finally drove home to me what I have suspected for years - that George Lucas did not and does not have a clue as to what made Star Wars great. He got lucky with the first one (this film) because it was a product of its time and was what people WANTED to see in 1977 - something hopeful and fun. Remember - or maybe you are too young to remember - movies in the mid 70s were extremely cynical post Watergate and post Vietnam. This one was different and even religious in an ecumenical way. Lucas got lucky with the second one because of the director and his input. To me, all the ones that came after The Empire Strikes Back were special effects filled duds. Now back to the original.In that cynical era in which nothing was black and white and everything seemed at least gray and a little tainted came this little space western. The sound effects were hokie, the graphics were poorly rendered, and all of the creatures were real men and women in rubber suits not CGI. But that was not the point. The point was that HERE was a force of pure evil - The Empire - that everybody could be completely against. The heroes were imperfect yet you could rally around them. You have a young boy of about 19 who is treated well by his farming aunt and uncle but wants a bigger destiny, you have an old man living in the hills like a hermit that wants that young boy to join the fight against the empire, and not until The Empire touches the boy personally does he make a rather hasty decision to do so. There is a girl, a princess, who is not waiting for somebody to come rescue her and helpless. She's tough, she can handle a weapon, and she can handle the fourth in their little band, Han Solo, who sticks his neck out for nobody a la Casablanca's Rick Blaine and seems completely mercenary, yet he gets involved. If you like science fiction and good old fashioned adventure you'll like it. If you are young and feel that your destiny is slipping through your fingers and are itching to make a difference, or if you are older and want a chance to right a wrong that you feel at least partially responsible for you'll love it. And you CAN shoot first in the face of danger, have lived a pretty self involved life, change, and become the hero. As the 1977 original trailer said ""Star Wars - for the fun of it"" and for the philosophy of it too.","

"roghache","26 March 2006","This is an incredibly entertaining and well crafted space epic that has become a modern day legend and spawned several (for me, disappointing) sequels and prequels. This classic is a basic story of good versus evil, combined with a futuristic space setting and special effects. While it may be kind of fun to jokingly tell others 'May the force be with you', no one should seriously be getting their theology from it (as a few cult like followers seem to) since really, it's essentially a science fiction fairy tale.As everyone must surely know, this original Star Wars tells the story of a handsome young farm boy and our hero, Luke Skywalker, who teams up with Han Solo, Chewbacca, a couple of 'droids' (C-P3O and R2-D2), and of course the grand master, Obi-Wan Kenobi to protect the galaxy from the villainous Darth Vader and save the beautiful Princess Leia from the clutches of the Evil Empire.The movie became part of everyday life in the late 1970's and 1980's, and the phrase 'Evil Empire' so commonplace and universally understood that President Raegan used it to describe the Communist regime of the former Soviet Union. His proposed plans for defensive space weaponry even became known as the Star Wars missile defense program.The actors are all perfect in their roles. Mark Hamill gives a charming boy next door heroism to the young Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford a charismatic magnetism to Solo, Carrie Fisher a vulnerability, yet smart and feisty competence to the captive Princess, and Alec Guinness a mature wisdom to Kenobi. Of course the real stars of the show are C-P3O and R2-D2, an extremely lovable character who never actually speaks but simply pops and whistles. Each droid has a clearly defined personality and their interaction together is priceless.It's a great story with wonderfully noble, courageous heroes and dark, dreadful villains. Wonderful special effects of course and star fighting action sequences. In fact, the problem for me with the later Star Wars movies is that, apart from developing the character of Darth Vader and revealing the origin of his wickedness, the other films are primarily effects, star fighting, and galactic bars. Short on plot for adults, in my opinion. I really enjoyed this original picture, but found the prequels and sequels boring to sit through. Also, the Star Wars movies do not have anything comparable to the character interaction present in the Star Trek TV series or films, which I much prefer to Star Wars, even this original episode.However, George Lucas and his string of Star Wars pictures are a legend, and this first movie at least is a barrel of entertainment for both kids and adults.","

"Mr-Fusion","25 May 2015","In all honesty, I didn't plan on watching ""Star Wars"" on its 38th anniversary, but a happy accident nonetheless. To see this movie is to go back to a time when the mythology was in its nascent stages, before all the merchandising and parodies (really, a testament to its cultural impact, which is immense). It's deceptively simple; all of the classical elements are here - clearly defined heroes and villains, robots, space pirates, wizards, princesses, sorcery - remixed and flung off into a faraway galaxy. It all makes for a potent brew, to say the least. And when all is said and done, the movie's real power is its ability to tap into the kid in all of us. This is just plain fun, and not even Lucas' shoddy CGI rejiggering can tarnish that.9/10","

"OllieSuave-007","16 June 2007","This is the movie that probably changed sci-fi and fantasy films of the cinema, full of action, imagination, nostalgia, character development and charm. The 4th movie of the Star Wars trilogy, but the first and original Star Wars movie filmed, it starts with a ship being invaded by Darth Vader, who has kidnapped Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Later on, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) teams up with Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Ben Kenobi (Alec Guiness), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) in an attempt to rescue the Princess Leia, who leads a group of rebels to defy the evil empire controlled by a ruthless Sith Lord and guarded by his trusted servant, Darth Vader. They must also stop the Death Star from destroying the galaxy. The result is one huge mission to save the galaxy, supported by superb direction and story from George Lucas and a memorable music score from John Williams.Each character was given his/her unique purpose in the movie, but all are committed to achieving triumph of the dark forces of evil. This fast-paced movie gives the audience a break from the reality of the problematic world, and takes you to a journey into an imagination beyond belief. Not to be missed.So, may the forces be with you.Grade B+","

"StevePulaski","23 March 2013","George Lucas' Star Wars is a project unlike one I've seen before, as cliché and as empty as that statement might sound. It's a monumental achievement in the cinematic world, arguably the biggest one ever, that pioneered special effects work and accommodated for other science-fiction projects to follow in the next decades. When released in 1977, with sufficient hype and outstanding reviews, it was a movie-going experience; thousands of showings were sold out (something you never hear about anymore), universal audiences were captivated, cultists and enthusiasts were born, and the eye-popping technology was cherished and admired by many.Watching Star Wars today (now called Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope with the release of the three prequels), there is still a uniquely affecting vibe that it sends with its compelling visuals and wonderfully articulated characters. It's over thirty years old, but it effectively holds the torch that makes it timeless. No matter how far technology progresses, and even with the onset of computer-animation and a heavy reliance on digital cinema, the look and beauty of Star Wars will likely never die out.Since it appears that everyone has seen the Star Wars movies except for myself, I will spare you the boredom of hearing the plot reiterated for the umpteenth time. Besides, I'm not sure if I could explain it accurately. The film is fast-paced, dynamic, and just works so competently, that after a while, I began to dissolve any questions I had about the plot and just go along for the ride. Consistent readers know what I think of constant cinematic evaluations, and that I find them to often be without a reward and potentially lethal to the likability of a film. Things happen in Star Wars; crazy things, logical things, smart things, frightening things, but above all, enthralling things.Speaking of enthralling things, I must admit how often I felt tension build and suspense become prevalent during the course of this film. For one thing, it's blatantly obvious to people who haven't even seen the series that these characters will make it (hence the two sequels). Yet, during several sequences, I found myself tense and extremely worried for these characters (most notably the scene in the trash chute). When a film can make you fear when you know the outcome is when you know true filmmaking tactics are at hand.Something I have notice happen with older science-fiction films is that one of their downsides is their length due to their special effects showcase. Let me explain; Star Trek: The Motion Picture was a visual marvel when it first came out, but its story was extended out about twenty-five minutes longer than it needed to be because they were showcasing the technology, which was breathtaking at the time. It appears, too, that many fans even recall this fact with a bit of sourness, which is why when people refer to the ""original trilogy"" of the Star Trek films, they usually mean the second film through the fourth one. Star Wars doesn't bear that same quality; it doesn't need to turn the story into a methodical plod just to show off its creative design and visuals. It doesn't feel like a showcase. We get a perfect feel for the environment without having to stare at for an upwards of five minutes.One thing that disheartens me greatly about this series is how controversial it has become. With numerous releases on DVD, and a new one on Blu-Ray, to my knowledge, the only original cuts of the Star Wars films you can see are on the Laserdisc/VHS versions. Because of this, fans have found themselves lambasting decisions made by Lucas, criticizing all the changes he has made to the series on the new releases of the DVDs, his re-releases of the movies in theaters, and lucrative branding/licensing of the figures in the money that, in 2013, continue to flood the store aisles of a Wal-Mart and Toys-R-Us near you. I believe that's one of the contributing reasons to why I never saw or even felt like seeing the original films until now; I felt alienated and bullied, with the series seemingly shoving itself down my throat.On a final note, another impressive element is the charisma and talent of a young Mark Hamill, portraying no one else but Luke Skywalker. Hamill seems like the kind of guy who, after breaking out in Lucas' trilogy of films, would have gone on to do unprecedented projects, but alas, no. Hamill has only acted in either small roles or cameos in films, and hasn't really worked on any other mainstream picture aside from the Star Wars trilogy. While this fact is slightly depressing, as one can only imagine what he could've done, it's fortunate we weren't burdened of seeing him in anything atrocious.Star Wars is, in short, an incorruptible masterpiece on film. A film that launched the genre of science fiction, propelling films about outer space to unheard of heights. It's just incredibly unfortunate to see what dismal treatment it, and its fans, have had to endure since its release.Starring: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford. Directed by: George Lucas.","

The characters feel like real people with fleshed out motivations. The effects although aged today definably inspired what we have today in the art of cinema. The score just like all the other films in the saga is fantastic. But what this movies greatest feat is just how much it inspired a generation of cinema, as well as is outstanding impact on pop culture that keeps this film fresh.In spite of how much we can all appreciate this movies impact it is still far from a perfect movie. Most of the acting is hooky, and the effects are hard to by today. And although it has a good sense of pacing it still has many plot conveniences. The action is also pretty slow which prevents it from feeling like a real fight is going on. Even the dialogue is pretty hooky and hard to by. This is a problem because if characters are unable to talk like people do it makes it hard to relate to them and get invested in there conflicts.In conclusion I can appreciate its impact on culture, as well as love the movie. I personally consider myself to be a Star Wars fan. Keeping in mind that I feel on an objective level I consider this picture to be above average instead of great I'm giving this one a 6/10.","

"tomasg-69814","28 October 2017","George Lucas was exhausted - and had lost several pounds - when his finished work finally was to be shown to the public officially on the big screen.The recordings had been very troublesome, and was on a budget shoestring until the end. (Did it stop at 11 M $ ?) In 1977 the movie landscape was very well mixed, but It lacked Space Adventures who was far out there.Spielberg's ""Close Encounter"" from the same year did not speculate in fantasy as deep as Lucas' adventure; here we got a whole table of pure imagination and creativity from a guy who just wanted to show us the eternal battle between good and bad, dark and light, his way.And by 1977's standards and special effects options of the era: What an enjoyable classic!It's an adventure who has a good mood from start to finish. Great locations, great humour, great acting.Don't want to cherish the old trilogy in front of the ""sequels"", but it brings heck a lot more charming and warm feeling re-seeing those 77- 83 flicks.I leave it that way......""Star Wars"" is probably one of the 10 most important movies of the 20th century.","

"sharky_55","25 November 2015","Star Wars begins not with opening credits, as the guild would enforce in those days, but with a scrawl that has become legendary. Back then, it was a few lines of yellow text scrolling across a lengthy screen that would be photographed on the backdrop of an infinite star- field, losing itself in a vanishing point far, far away. A modest effect, yet those words instantly paint a picture so incredibly vivid that it would kick-start a hugely popular and successful franchise. And it is nothing without its iconic fanfare by John Williams. Take a listen to Holst's Mars movement and see how Williams transforms all the heroism, all the grandiosity and glory into one of the most recognisable themes of all time. And then we pan down and observe a little ship being pursued by a gigantic one, something so immediately identifiable, and we already are entranced.It is a film that is at once lifted and tainted by Lucas' love for it. We see an entire world envisioned, and the production design so effortlessly ushering us into this aged future. When we crash land in the desert planet Tatooine, we recognise the arid setting, before just a hint of alien and droid life instantly transports our minds to millions of stars and galaxies away. Something so simple as adding an extra sun bathes the horizon for miles and miles with an air of mystery and other worldliness. When we encounter civilisation of sorts, Lucas gently pushes in an intergalactic band, a sleazy bar, aliens and creatures of all sizes - the usual alcoholic suspects. And when we need to take to the skies, the matte painted backgrounds do much of the work; hordes of stormtrooper minions, a grimy and worn Millennium Falcon, the great big grey walls of the Death Star buzzing with machinery and lights. Lucas would later insert his own little (or not so) CGI creations not because of any real need, but because the technology was now available, but this only highlights how perfect the world-building was in the first place. The new digitally rendered beasts look impressive yet noticeable shiny and over- expressive in the worn and dusty Mos Eisley, and sometimes the camera will linger unnecessarily as if to say ""Look at what we can do now!"" But we had been long immersed before that.The story is of course a familiar one. It has roots in Joseph Campbell's Hero and Flash Gordon and even Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress; a story with mythic origins. And there are tell-tale signs of Lucas own American Graffiti a few years back. But Star Wars has evolved beyond those and becomes a treasure in its own right. The original created a world beyond the imaginable scope of that time, a sci-fi universe so living and breathing that people flocked again and again to experience it in theatres. Little details and mistakes become cultish and infamous themselves; the stormtrooper who bumps his head on the roof, Solo's comment about his ship's speed, and when a character's characterisation is marred, fans respond; Han shot first.Looking back on it years gone by, it is inescapable to notice the ageing special effects. That is simply a fact of changing technologies. Yet I still marvel on how impeccably and competently Star Wars is crafted. The sound design is alien and fantastically so; simple acts of pulling on steel cable and microphone interference create these iconic noises, and of course the bright and noisy hum of the lightsabers. Years on we had incoherent and frenetically choreographed battles that seem more like acrobatic dance recitals, and the blades of light flashed at a hundred miles an hour, but here we have Guinness characterised in these simple but powerful strokes, the intent on his face, the recognition of an old pupil, the concentration of a chess match as they probe for a weakness. The space-fight scenes are edited like a dogfight from WW2 with precision by Marcia Lucas (a remarkable presence you don't notice until her absence), and the simply act of placing these fighter pilots on the backdrop of a whizzing and laser filled backdrop is thrilling. As the motion control photography soars through the space and trenches of the death star, these miniatures and models looks immense and engaging.A gigantic bear-like creature and a small white droid speak not a word, but become fan favourites anyway. There is Darth Vader, who becomes even more menacing when comparing the original voice before the iconic wheezing of James Earl Jones was brought in. There is the plucky young hero, who's fate is only hinted at here, and it takes another two films for the story to become more mature, and his circle to complete. The roguish Han Solo is likewise expanded further in the sequels, as is his relationship with the Princess Leia as they continue to bicker. But is is here in this special film that it all began. The magic of Star Wars is that it takes place in a galaxy so far, far away, but it has become so close over the years, and so familiar.(Originally 9/10)","

"gregmovies","1 September 2008","Filled with great characters and a fun story, Star Wars is well deserving of its reputation as a classic. John Williams score alone makes this a film worth seeing. The characters are unforgettable and the special effects impressive for its time, but very outdated now. The different alien species are one of the best things about the film. The Cantina scene showing an array of Lucas' creations is particularly fun.I give this film a 7/10. Looking at it subjectively, it isn't a really good film. A lot of clichés, bad dialogue, cracker jack philosophy, and unimpressive acting. Yet, for some reason, I find it hard to say anything bad about this movie. My favorite film as a child, and one I still enjoy, mostly for nostalgia.","

"Laz75","1 February 2000","There's not much to say about this movie this is *THE* movie that changed it all.It's my favourite movie, and not only among the quadrilogy, among all movies; it has everything that can be great in a movie, great characters, great story, great sights, great special effects (they don't show 23 years) and a mythological background that made us dream for decades now, and that'll keep us dreaming for a long, long time. Maybe the characters I liked most in this one are Old Obi-Wan Kenobi, wonderfully portrayed by Alec Guinness, and Han Solo, Harrison Ford's first important role, they're both great.Not to mention John Williams' wonderful score, without of it, the movie wouldn't have been this great it's a perfect mix, that's what it is!","

"jdberkley","17 May 2006","Having read a lot of the other comments here, I have to say it's interesting to see how many people begin by saying how old they were when they saw ""Star Wars"" for the first time(Full disclosure: I was three. My parents saw it at a drive-in theatre, and all I can remember of that experience was seeing Darth Vader for the first time, and knowing that he was very, very bad). I think that speaks to its extraordinary impact. ""Star Wars"" was an event, I suppose in the way that the Beatles on Ed Sullivan for the first time was an event. It dates you, to a degree, but the reason it was important-- the reason it remains important-- is that it showed you what was possible. For much of the 1960s and 1970s, filmmakers had concentrated on showing us the brutal, heartbreaking truth of our world(The Godfather, Chinatown, Nashville-- some of the best movies ever made), and many of them succeeded brilliantly. But there's a place for dreaming dreams of things that have never been, too, and ""Star Wars"", with its epic tale of an Empire and a rebellion in a galaxy far, far away, was the dream a generation didn't know it wanted to have until George Lucas gave it to us.Is it juvenile, at times? Simplistic, even? Sure. So's the truth, sometimes. We want to believe there's a Force, and that Luke can master its use in time to defeat the forces of darkness. So we believe it. Are the effects a bit dated now? Sure, although I still believe them. Did the success of ""Star Wars"" possibly kick off the modern blockbuster era, which gives us more and more special-effects-drenched dreck every year? Sadly, it probably did. But the thing the wannabe heirs of ""Star Wars"" usually lack is the one thing that made ""Star Wars"" such an event--courage.Back in 1977, nobody was making movies like this. Nobody thought a film like this, with its mythic storytelling arc and its sweeping vision of intergalactic war, could possibly work...with the exception of George Lucas and his fellow filmmakers.I didn't know all that at the time, of course. Like I said, I was only three. But having watched more movies than most people my age now, I feel comfortable saying that in its way, ""Star Wars"" is as much an independent auteur's film as anything by John Cassavetes or Woody Allen-- it has the same sort of daring, the same desire not to settle for less than showing us something we've never seen before. A bold, grand sense of old-style craftsmanship infuses everything in ""Star Wars"", and the film delivers on the promise contained in its subtitle. At the time, it really was a new hope.","
