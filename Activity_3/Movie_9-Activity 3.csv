"Harakiri","noralee","16 September 2005","I saw Harakiri (Seppuku) in a new 35 mm print at NYC's Film Forum. This is a brilliant use of a narrow period genre to explosively indict politics and culture. Writers Shinobu Hashimoto and Yasuhiko Takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by ""The Count of Monte Cristo,"" Ambrose Bierce and Howard Hawks' Westerns as much as by samurai literature and movies.The film begins deceptively as a story within a story, seemingly providing a traditional example of upholding samurai honor, such as in the conventional, oft-retold tale of ""The 47 Ronin."" The context is set at a time when the central government, the shogunate, is supplanting local clans and arbitrarily unemploying thousands of people, notably their samurai, forcing them into the mercenary mode of ronin at best and begging for food at worse. But the parallels to the 20th century are made repeatedly explicit as the samurai who comes to this clan seeking help is from Hiroshima.Very gradually we get further insight on the tale within a tale, as we see more flashbacks within flashbacks into what each character has been doing before these confrontations and we get uneasy inklings that the moral of the story may not be what it appears at first and the stakes get higher and higher with almost unbearable tension.It is almost halfway through the film until we see a female and we suddenly see an alternative model of masculinity, where a priority is put on family, support, education and creative productivity. In comparison to the macho opening relationships, with their emphasis on formal militaristic loyalty to a hierarchy, a loving husband and father is practically a metrosexual. Seeing the same stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds to his grandbaby puts the earlier, ritualized scenes in sharp relief, particularly the recurring image of the clan's armor which seems less and less imposing and is finally destroyed as an empty symbol.The psychological tension in the confrontations in the last third of the film is more excruciating than the actual violence. Even when we thought we already knew the outcome from the flashbacks, the layers of perception of relationships and personalities are agonizingly peeled away with each thrust of a sword to reveal the depths of the horrifying hypocrisy of the political and social structure. And those are just the overwhelming cultural resonances that a 21st century American can glean. Like ""Downfall (Der Untergang),"" it reveals the inhumane mentality that led to World War II.The repeating motif of long walks then confrontations down empty corridors emphasizes the stultifying bureaucratic maze that entraps the characters. The revenge motifs are accented by startlingly beautiful cinematography that recalls traditional Japanese art, including drops of blood like first snow flakes then a waterfall.The over all effect of this masterpiece is emotionally draining.","

"Harakiri","Galina_movie_fan","21 March 2007","I've said it once about another movie, incidentally by the other great Japanese director as well and I want to repeat my words in regard to ""Harakiri"": ""There are good, very good, and even great movies. But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own"". Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" aka ""Seppuku"" is one of them. The film of rare power and humanism, of highest artistic achievements, profoundly moving, tragic like the best Shakespeare's plays, universal and timeless even if it takes place in the faraway country of 1630, by the words of one of the reviewers ""Harakiri"" ""is to cinema as the Sistine Chapel is to painting. Unsurpassable!"" The film grabbed me from the very first shot, from its opening credits with their perfect harmony of kanji (I believe it is a correct word to describe the writings) characters, with the unusual disturbing score and with the dark beauty of the images. And then the story begins that centers on Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai), one of hundreds or maybe even thousands unemployed lord less samurais, ronin, that in the blessed times of peace had not many choices to adjust to new life and often preferred to commit a ritual suicide, hara-kiri or seppuku on the property of the wealthy estate owners. According to Bushido, the way of the samurai, ""One who is a samurai must before all things keep constantly in mind, by day and by night . . . the fact that he has to die. That is his chief business."" At the same time, samurai and anti-samurai film, ""Harakiri"" offers the masterfully screened scenes of sword-fights, not plentiful but exquisitely choreographed, perfectly paced and unbearably intense but the film is much more than that. It is also a gripping court drama where the truth is unfolded in the flashbacks. The viewers are allowed to look closer at the noble Samurai code of behavior and to reflect on how its abuse impacts the fate of an individual and the society in general. Compelling, poetic, and tragic, the movie has one of the most pessimistic endings ever that makes you wonder how the history is made, how the historical events are interpreted and who decides what would be written in the chronicles and important documents and what would be left out.A Masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made, ""Harakiri"" deserves all its praise. It is not in my nature to force my opinion on anyone but if you call yourself a movie buff or a movie lover, you MUST see this film.","

"Harakiri","Sleepin_Dragon","28 December 2022","The story of a Samurai, who requests to commit harakiri.I have read many of the reviews with a great deal of respect, many have such an understanding of the culture, and a very deep understanding of the content of the film, for my ignorance I come here as a novice, with no understanding, so from my viewpoint, I'm watching a film I've been told I'd love. I've seen one samurai film prior to this.First off, I had to check it was actually made in 1962, it felt way more advanced than that, the concepts and production.I thoroughly engaged with it, the story was fascinating, and where I expected it to tell a general story, the focus was pretty much on one single character, Hanshiro Tsugumo.Some of the pacing me be hard for some, the long drawn out scenes, I find very purposeful. The music is engaging, the acting terrific.I wasn't surprised to learn that the swords and multitude of blades used in this movie were real, and that I think is one of the film's most successfully aspects, its authentic, a story presented in a very real fashion.It's a powerful story, 9/10.","

"Harakiri","frankde-jong","12 June 2020","The generation that came after the renown Japanese directors Kurosawa, Ozu and Mizoguchi is generally regarded as less talented. The main representatives of this generation are Kaneto Shindo, Kon Ichikawa en Masaki Kobayshi. Personally I would like to make an exception for Masaki Kobayashi, who is in my opinion the equal of Kurosawa, Ozu and Muzoguchi.Kobayashi is best known in the West for his ghost stories ""Kwaidan"" (1964). The rest of his repertoire, among which the samurai movie ""Harakiri"" (1962), is not to be sneezed at either.A samurai movie is usually seen as a sort of Western of the East. Main ingredients of the Western genre are action and the battle beween the law (good) and the villains (bad).In ""Harakiri"" (which literal translation is: hara = belly , kiri = cutting) in stead of the law there is the samurai code of honor (Bushido in Japanese). But this code of honor is not the good element of the film. Rather it is revealed as a force of ruthlessness and hypocrisy. In the film the Bushido is represented by the Li clan.In ""Harakiri"" there is also little action. Only towards the end there is something that can be seen as a ""shoot out"". But in this shoot out the evil is not overcome, but only revealed as shallow (the idol of the Li clan is shown to be an empty armor).Translated in Western movie genres ""Harakiri"" is therefore no Western. Maybe it can be categorised as a Court room drama. The heart of the film consists of main character Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) telling his sad story. This story is in essence a requisitor against the Bushido. The performance of Nakadai as a broken Tsugumo is brilliant. His requisitor is not only aimed at the Li clan, but also against his own past. Once Tsugumo also was a samurai.Kobayashi was a convinced humanist all his life. Apart from ""Harakiri"" he also made the 9,5 hours epos ""The human condition"" (1959-1961). This epos is situated in World War II. For Kobayashi kamikaze was just another form of Harakiri and thus just another utterance of the old Bushido.","

"Harakiri","OttoVonB","7 October 2005","Having seen this film the mind becomes clouded with the innumerable things to say about it. Only praise comes to mind. Kobayashi has crafted The great samurai film for the rebel generation and he mixes a deftly handled criticism of authoritarian hypocrisy with a very touching piece of human drama.The plot is deceptively simple: an old samurai (touchingly portrayed by Tatsuya Nakadai of ""Ran"", ""Kagemusha"" and ""Sword of Doom"") arrives at a clan castle to commit seppuku in their yard, and then tells his tale, seemingly trying to gain time at first. What seems to be the rambling of an old man soon turns out to be a grieving account of how this man (and, more significantly, his loved ones) was wronged by the clan. Then comes the violent revenge (this is where you think ""Wild Bunch with katanas"", though they do up the ante toward the end with guns...).Kobayashi's direction is masterful, keeping an unbearable suspense during the mostly talky film, handling the touching scenes with care and maturity and giving us a sweeping fight to top all that. The 133 minutes running time never feels half that long! At the heart of it all though, is Nakadai, who, despite an excellent CV, delivers his greatest performance ever. His Tsugumo evokes a wounded panther, grieving an grieving until it gives in to fury. Nakadai's performance alone marks the film as essential viewing.If you're open to samurai flicks, this will rank among the finest films you've ever seen.","

"Harakiri","futures-1","17 July 2005","""Harakiri"" (""Seppuku"") (Japanese, 1962): It is the 17th century. A young Samurai warrior arrives at a mansion, asking to perform his ritual death there. In a series of flashbacks, we learn who he is, why he came, and what has occurred since. Although quietly told by another ex-warrior (about whom we also learn more), this is an interesting story that builds in complexity and tension. Debates about rituals and appearances may at first seem to hold more significance in old Japan than in the contemporary United States, but it is not difficult to translate and implement such thoughts. Love, honor, duty, family, children, saving ""face"", determination, desperationthey all exist in OUR everyday lives. Dramatically photographed in beautiful black & white, given a strong Japanese score, and paced so that even the mildly patient will be glad they saw it, ""Harakiri"" is epically huge, and a must-see for story & film lovers.","

"Harakiri","Duree","8 November 2001","This film is the purest distillation of the spirit of Greek tragedy ever put on celluloid.  Yes, this is a review of Seppuku, a Japanese film released in 1962.  Perhaps it took a non-Westerner, free of all of the cultural baggage and ridiculous associations, to see straight into the heart of the tragic mode and make it palpable and alive in the twentieth century.  That is not all: the black and white cinematography is both formally assured and often outrageously daring; the soundtrack is one of the finest efforts of the greatest Japanese composer of the 20th century (or any century for that matter); the acting is demonically inspired; and the narrative is relentlessly gripping and involving.  The film illuminates the relationship between the individual and society and between society and history.  It is a tender meditation on familial love and the ties of friendship that transcend even death.  This film will cut open your bowels, pull your soul out, and force you to stare it in the face.  There may be other films that attain similar heights, but I cannot imagine any film, ever, being more perfect. Forget Citizen Kane, Seven Samurai, the Godfather, etc. etc. all of those commodified canonical works that everybody raves about because everybody else is raving about them.  Don't get me wrong, they're fine--but this stuff is 200 proof.  See it today.  Buy it yesterday.","

"Harakiri","lstrawser","13 April 2006","Harakiri is an excellent human drama set in feudal Japan that involves a ronin presenting himself to a powerful clan and asking to commit harikiri. However, through a series of flashbacks we see that this ronin is motivated by more than the idea of dying honorably. The events that follow are a critique of the feudal system and a celebration of dying for one's beliefs.Every frame in Harikiri is wonderfully composed and a treat to view. The cinematography is crisp, the sets wonderful and the actors are spectacular. Much can be said about this film's technical merits as well as its social implications. I found out about this film through my love of Akira Kurosawa's samurai dramas (who else...) and I must say that it is very different from Kurosawa-sans work although it draws inevitable comparisons. Due to its themes, Harikiri is more of an anti samurai film. Generally Kurosawa's work seems to glorify the honor of the samurai and celebrate them as Japanese heroes by showing them gloriously in battle. Kurosawa is the Japanese John Ford, taking an icon from his culture and celebrating it. Harikiri exposes the virtues that Kurosawa portrays as being ""a facade"" to directly quote the film.I say this so as not to mislead any potential viewers, I do not know enough about Japanese history to judge what the samurai really stood for and really I am not concerned with the idea. This is the only Kobyashi film I have seen and it has been brought to my attention that many of his films deal with similar themes. All in all I think that Harikiri is a wonderful film that offers a new take on feudal Japan.","

"Harakiri","jonsefcik","17 February 2019","Seven Samurai is pretty great, but I think Harakiri is even better. This tale of a ronin seeking revenge and exposing the flawed samurai code is so close to perfection. The story is engrossing and despite the slow pacing it's never boring. What the production lacks in scale it makes up for with emotional intensity. The sparse, ominous score is perfect for this film. The direction and cinematography are masterful and the camera's slow pans and zooms really butter my croissant. The editing is great and purposeful too. There's not a single weak performance but Tatsuya Nakadai in the leading role steals the show.My only complaints are with some of the pacing and fight choreography. There's a standoff scene in the middle that could have been cut (since it felt like a cheap way to build tension and it wouldn't make sense for them to continue waiting afterward) and the long flashback could have also been trimmed. The film is 2 hours 13 minutes but I think exactly 2 hours would have been perfect. From a fight choreography standpoint the one-on-one fight scenes were well done but climax was shaky. There were many interesting ideas and moments in there, but also several points where I was like ""okay, how did they not strike him there?""Harakiri is an outstanding film that deserves more attention. If you haven't seen this film check it out. The Criterion restoration is absolutely beautiful. I intentionally kept this review vague since it's best to go into it knowing as little as possible. With a few thousand more ratings, this film would be pretty high up on the IMDb Top 250, and I'd be delighted to see it there.","

The warrior Hikokuro Omodaka (Tetsurô Tanba) convinces the clan to force Chijiiwa to really commit suicide using his bamboo blade as an example to other samurais that would appear using the same pretext to receive coins from the master.Tsugumo discloses that the lad Chijiiwa was his son-in-law that was forced to the situation expecting to raise some money to treat his sick wife and baby son. Further, Tsugumo had arrives in the house expecting to die not committing suicide, but revenging Chijiiwa, his daughter and his grandson.""Harakiri"" is a heartbreaking and tragic story of poverty and revenge in a period when Japan was ruled by the Tokugawa clan and thousand of samurais lost their work with the fall of the clans.

"Harakiri","tintin-23","9 September 2006","It would seem impossible that any ""samurai"" movie could surpass Kurosawa's ""Ran,"" ""Kagemusha,"" or even ""Rashomon"" in visual impact, masterful storytelling, and moral imperative. However, there is such a film, and it is ""Seppuku"" (""Harakiri""), produced in 1962, arguably the best samurai movie ever made.""Harakiri"" (1962), as it is known in the West, was directed by one of the post-WWII great filmmakers of Japan, Masaki Kobayashi. This film, considered by many as his masterpiece, won him the International Jury Prize at Cannes in 1965. Unfortunately, Kabayashi is not as well known outside Japan as some other giants of the Japanese cinema. He was very much affected by the war, and his films, contrary to most Japanese filmmakers of the post-war eras, are very political in nature. Kobayashi's films explore the dark side of the Japanese culture, with its wars, corruption, and hypocrisy, and their consequences. His film, ""The Thick-Walled Room"" (1953), won him the 1956 Peace Culture Prize. His nine-hour trilogy, ""The Human Condition"" (1959/61), won the International Jury Prize at Cannes 1963, which actually launched his public recognition, presents a scathing critique of the horrors of WWII, experienced first-hand while on the Manchurian front, and later on the Ryukyu Islands. While serving, as a statement of dissent against war, he refused any promotion and remained a private until he was taken prisoner by the U.S. He spent one year in a prison camp before returning to the business of film making, in 1946, until 1952 as an assistant director under Keisuke Kinishita.In Japan, Seppuku is the formal term for ritual suicide by disembowelment. Harakiri, as it is known in the West, is the common term, which literally means ""stomach cutting."" It was an integral part of bushido, the code of conduct of the samurai warrior class. Seppuku was ordered by a superior as punishment to redeem some offence, or chosen over a dishonorable death at the hands of an enemy. In both cases, it demonstrated the honor, courage, loyalty, and high moral character of the individual. Except when performed on a battlefield, it was a very formal ceremony, requiring certain etiquette, witnesses and considerable preparation.Harakiri is a particularly painful and rather messy way of ending one's days. In this ritual, the ""performer"" opens his abdomen, starting from left to right and then finishing from top toward bottom. But there is so need to be left for hours contemplating one's entrails. Another swordsman acting as a ""second,"" called kaishakunin, is standing by to decapitate the departing at a pre-arranged moment in the ceremony. Lord Ieyasu Tokugawa, who founded Japan's last great shogunate dynasty in 1603, ordered the practice of harakiri to be discontinued by both secondary and primary retainers. Later on, in 1663, a stronger edict from Lord Nobutsuna Matsudaira of Izu, put an end to the practice altogether. By that time, the ritual had become an idle formalism, and the ""performer"" was decapitated at the instant he took his sword out of the scabbard, thus avoiding a painful death. In some instances, the sword was replaced by a fan.Hanshiro Tsugomo (Tatsuya Nakadai) comes to the castle of the Iyi Clan to seek revenge for the humiliation and cruel death of his son-in-law, Anjiwa Motome (Akira Ishihama). Kobayashi is a superb storyteller, and in a slow and deliberate rhythm, he develops his story, which could have been taken from the pages of the Iliad or of the Mahabharata. The tension grows, as the Clan members slowly realize that they are in turn being humiliated by this stranger who truly believe in the samurai code of honor: he must be terminated to prevent him to broadcast his truth.The final duel with the master swordsmen of the Clan, Hikukuro Omodaka, on the Plains of Gojin-in, is like a meditation, a ballet of death. The film ends in a spectacular combat, and the coup de grace to Hanshiro Tsugomo's seppuku is fittingly not applied by a gallant swordsman, but a cowardly platoon of muskets. Even to the end, the samurai honor code has been violated by the Clan.As Toshiro Mifune has long been associated with the success of Kurosawa's films, so are Kogayashi's films enhanced by the brilliant interpretation of Tatsuya Nakadai (also staring in the leading roles in Kurosawa's ""Kagemusha"",and ""Ran""). This outstanding actor contributed further to the success of this director's films, ""Kwaidan"" and the ""Samurai Rebellion."" The screenplay by Shinobu Hashimoto is based on a novel by Yasuhiko Takiguchi The cinematography, by Yoshio Miyajima, in black and white, is gorgeous. Many on the shots are ""haiku-like"" in the imagery. The musical score, written for an ensemble of ancient instruments and percussion by the renowned classical composer Toru Takemitsu, is used sparingly throughout the film, reinforcing the dramatic moments.Masaki Kobayashi's film is an indictment of the hypocrisy of the establishment, any establishment, would it be in feudal 17th Century Japan or in any other time. Dogma, on which the establishment's authority rests, is evil. The established, codified order, with all its smoke and mirrors, must be preserved at all costs, and nothing must be allowed to come in its way. It is the duty of each member of any government, organization, church, or brotherhood not to spare any effort and to go to any length to protect the appearances and status quo, to achieve this essential goal of survival. The end justifies the means, and no lie or deceit can be eliminated if this survival is at stake.Although taking place almost five centuries ago during the Tokugawa Shogunate, this film is also a strong denunciation of the entrenched cultural legacy of coercive rituals, blind obedience, and chauvinism that resulted in the tragedy of the Pacific War.The outstanding screenplay, the superb acting, the cinematography and editing makes ""Harakiri"" the best samurai film ever.","

"Harakiri","gubami","28 October 2004","When I first saw this movie, I did not know much about it. I saw it for a class so I was given a little background of the time period. In fact I was pretty much just told this: This movie takes place during the time where many Samurai were left ronins, or masterless. These samurai were unable to find work and thereby were left in poverty. Eventually many would go up to clans and ask to commit seppuku.It was dishonorable to refuse such a ""noble"" request, but most clans did not want samurai to kill themselves on their property so they would just pay the samurai to go elsewhere.So I watched the movie and well... I loved it. During the class discussion the next day I found most people hated the movie. Not because it was a bad movie, but because of how it made people feel about themselves. And that's exactly why this movie is genius. If you're interested in watching this movie, do not read the summary in detail - reading the summary in detail will deprive you of what one of the key things that made the movie great IMO.","

"Harakiri","tedg","4 February 2015","This has to be the best movie I have seen in a while. Good luck to me that I would like to pass on to you.We have two warring narrators. The first begins the film as an entry in his journal as local governor of a wealthy country estate. The film is closed with him finishing his entry, some days later. This official narrative deviates from what we see at the end.His story: one, then a second unattached ronin appeal to commit suicide in their courtyard. The first of these it is plain is just looking to be paid to leave, but our narrator is very strict about cleaving to that ronin's story. If he says he wants to kill himself, well then he must. This poor man had sold his sword and was now carrying bamboo, and it is this that he was forced to use. The resulting death is disturbing.So midway in the film, we have a samurai who has suffered because he was forced to live his story, forced by the narrator-governor who we later watch not live the story he has created and instead change it to suit.Now along comes an older samurai with the same request. He is dealt with in the same manner, but insists on telling a story to the assembled household before killing himself. He tells an amazing story: a fall from grace of his master, the dissolution of the household, poverty. His frail daughter and her son lay dying without a few coins for a doctor. The man's son is his daughter's husband, and it is he that came and was forced to die. The wife and son do as well, shortly after. Details of that death were told by the governor to the elder samurai earlier, though known because of the mocking way the body was returned.Until now, we have a classic case of warring narrative. We have the captive audience assembled. One storyteller is an official, so much so that he controls the official version of the film's story. The other has power in his gritty, true story. That story, incidentally is very close to what I consider noir: a random innocent fellow is cast in circumstances that seem full of circumstance and accident. The events of his life are played out not as they would in real life but as they would in a fictional life in a story told by others.Truth versus power in a struggle for the story of the film, essentially a struggle for the allegiance of the outer audience: us.The two beings as they face off are perfect in small mannerisms belying tension.Then slowly, the governor's world explodes as we learn new bits of the elder ronin's story of recent events. Many die.We (the audience) and control of all the cinematic effects was won by the ronin. Our governor is seen at the end writing the official account to be seen by his master that for his safety eradicates all story on both sides. The main actor, the winner, features in some of Kurosawa's best work as well.","

But when the ronin inquires about a younger samurai (Akira Ishihama) who arrived before him things take an unexpected turn.For many, samurai films may be closer associated with Kurosawa... but this one, possibly the best ever made, comes from Masaki Kobayashi. How does Kobayashi not have the same level of international fame as Kurosawa? Interestingly, Hanshirō is able to fight off a great many retainers with a sword, yet is helpless against three guns; this is a foreshadow of the Meiji Restoration, wherein sword-bearing samurai were defeated by the ""new"" Japanese military. Indeed, the whole notion of ""honor"" and all that comes with it is radically changed once the battles become uneven.","

It did not have sub-titles, and as my Japanese is not very good, I made some assumptions about the characters, relationships, the plot,etc. When I saw it with sub-titles, I was surprised at how few incorrect assumptions I had made.  That I made so few errors is no credit to me, but rather to how well the plot, character development, character relationships, and the overall movie were done.The movie is not limited to feudal Japan, for it transcends this era.  It has lessons, for those who look for this in art.  For instance, just one example occurs to me now:  It underscores the need for a person to stand on principle, and to maintain their honor, ethics, and dignity, even when those who are the political leaders have long since lost theirs.  However for purely entertainment value, the realism, suspense, art, and action could not be better. Words fail to express how this film captivates and entertains. Few films can equal this one.

Everything is this movie is exceptional: the cinematography is top notch, the acting is very good, the direction is almost perfect.Tragedy, revenge, ethics, political contents...this movie has all of these elements wrapped in an exceptional 16th century samurai environment.The only defects I could see in this movie is that someone may feel it is slightly slow (as actually there are very few action scenes...this is not a ""chambara"" movie!) and the fact that it is not dubbed (at least in the Italian edition)...so you lose some of the details while reading the subtitles....that is, unless you understand Japanese.If you like black & white Japanese movies this is definitely a must see. GREAT.","

"Harakiri","auberus","19 May 2008","Masaki Kobayashi studied art and philosophy before starting as assistant director at Shochiku studio. His oeuvre is guided by the need to understand the human condition. In the 1962 Hara-kiri aka Seppuku, we can clearly see the philosophic influence in this story about confrontation between Human condition and Rigid Code of a feudal society. The result of this confrontation is a multi layered masterpiece in which the clarity of the script, the perfection of the interpretation, and a very well balanced ""mise en scène"" make for a powerful film based on transgression: a genre transgression, a code transgression and an image transgression. Most of Shambaras take place during the Edo Period but rather late in that period (just before the Meiji Era) as most filmmakers try to romanticize and glamorize the period which marks the end of the Samurai thus playing the nostalgia card. Here Masaki Kobayashi transgressed the genre and decided to film a story taking place in 1630, 17th century Japan during the Edo period. At that time Japan was ruled by a Shogunate (Ieyasu Tokugawa). The Tokugawa Shoguns established Peace and continued to rule Japan for a remarkable 250 years. But such a long period of Peace had a price and Ieyasu Tokugawa brought the whole country under tight control. He cleverly redistributed the land among the more loyal vassals, breaking up warrior clans thus throwing thousands of samurai into poverty. In the film an elder ronin, Hanshiro Tsugumo, the hypnotic Tatsuya Nakadai (Goyokin) seeks admittance to the house of a feudal lord to commit the act of Seppuku as he can no longer stand his Life of Dishonor and Poverty. There, the administrator tells him about the fate of a young Samurai who committed the same suicidal ritual few times ago. But there is much more to this story and soon we understand that all protagonists are related one way or another. As the film progresses we witness a confrontation between two conceptions. One is based on a Human code; the other is based on a rigid traditional one. Masaki Kobayashi uses both symbols and raw images to show this confrontation. The film starts with the Display of a Samurai shining battle armor representing the feudal system. The armor is empty of anything human and strongly symbolized the feudal system. Can a code make sense if it is followed without acknowledging the Human condition? This is in essence the question raised by ""Hara-kiri"". We see this armor soiled and dragged but at the end of the film the armor remains intact as if nothing had ever happened, as if changes in an given Society take some times to occur. Indeed social Progress has always been slow leaving Men and Women struggling with their condition. The suicidal ritual, Hara-kiri reinforced the sense of cruelty. Raw images of Ronin opening their stomach with a sword were a transgression at that time (1962), still is today. In the film the ritual is portrayed in a non glamorized way and very realistically. It also symbolizes even for the Japanese audience the lack of sense in the act of Seppuku. In fact Hanshiro Tsugumo is the only one giving meaning to this act by motivating it with mixed feelings of Love, Revenge and Sorrow, in short with humanity. With the film Hara-kiri, Masaki Kobayashi signed one of the greatest philosophical films. The script by Shinobu Hashimoto is a good example on how to make a story clear but more importantly sufficient enough for anybody to understand the drama, in one word universal. Also writer of Jôi-uchi: Hairyô tsuma shimatsu aka Samurai Rebellion (1967), Dai-bosatsu tôge (1966) aka Sword of Doom or ""Hitokiri"" aka Tenchu (1969), Shinobu Hashimoto is among the greatest writers of the 7th Art. I can not recommend Seppuku enough, every single frame, acting, piece of music is irreproachable. The story is profoundly Humanist, timeless and universal. I suggest we all confront the codes of our respective societies in order to find out if they still make sense or if they are leading us towards a terrible social Hara-kiri","

"Harakiri","classicsoncall","4 March 2018","Unlike all the Kurosawa films I've seen, this one has a principal protagonist that announces his intention early in the story and then takes the viewer on a stunning journey of revenge that's entirely unexpected. Director Masaki Kobayashi prepares the viewer with a preliminary accounting of the fate of thousands of unemployed Samurai as a result of the 17th Century dissolution of the Japanese Shogunate. Masterless Samurai, or ronin, appear at the doorstep of a feudal lord requesting a place in which to perform ritual suicide, but for the dishonorable, this effort is merely a ploy to accept some small token of monetary value before moving on. ""Harakiri"" tells the story of two such ronin, and until we learn the true relationship of both men to each other, the viewer is at a loss to understand the real motivation of Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai). With frequent forays into the past utilizing a series of flashbacks, Tsugumo relates the story of his son-in-law, helpless in the face of his wife's deteriorating physical condition and unable to seek medical attention for their sick baby due to lack of resources. What I found quite clever about the story was the absence of the three men Tsugumo called for to be his seconds for the purpose of hara-kiri. One realizes that it can't be simple coincidence that none of these men are available, as the story swerves to a desperate climax that pits Tsugumo against the entire House of Iyi. What would have been a tremendous let down in the story is avoided when Tsugumo follows through on his original mission, unable to physically overpower all the retainers employed by the clan's Master. So many films have the story's hero defeat an overwhelming number of rival opponents that it reduces the credibility factor to zero. At the point Tsugumo knows he can no longer pursue a fight strategy, he takes his life in the ritual manner. For followers of Japanese cinema, this film is a must see, with it's emphasis on honor, loyalty and embracing the truth of one's convictions. Tsugumo's unselfish final act unmasks the hypocrisy of the feudal lord's position, and mocks the cowardice of it's counselor Saito (Rentarô Mikuni). An appropriate amount of swordplay attends the story without becoming excessive, allowing for the more subtle aspects of Tsugumo's strategy to take over the narrative, which it does in compelling fashion.","

"Harakiri","WaveTossed","28 June 2005","A classic, surviving the test of time -- made in 1962 about 17th century people. Here in 2005, we still watch and discuss the film and the issues that it raises. Tsugumo Hanshiro, a middle-aged ronin formerly serving a clan abolished by the Shogunate, appears at the Ii clan gate. He wishes to commit seppuku rather than live on in poverty. In his inner headquarters, Saito Kageyu, the chief retainer, bemoans the fact that hordes of starving ronin have been making similar requests at clan gates; most have wanted handouts rather than to actually commit seppuku. Kageyu suspects the same of Hanshiro. Kageyu attempts to discourage Hanshiro. He tells a tale of another ronin from the same abolished clan, Chijiiwa Motome. Motome had appeared a few months earlier, with a request, but had carried bamboo sword blades  the clan members had been enraged. As an example to other scrounging ronin, particularly those without real blades, the clan decided to force Motome to commit seppuku with his own bamboo wakizashi. Hanshiro tells his own life story. The film shows us some historical background. Thousands of ex-retainers had been thrown out of their positions, made into ronin, by the Shogunate's abolishing of clans. In the rigid class system (samurai, farmers, artisans, merchants), these displaced ex-retainers had no place at all, being forced into marginal subsistence. Most trades (because they required long periods of apprenticeship) were out for most ronin. Many ronin became outlaws or obtained bodyguard positions for gangsters. If law-abiding, they were able to teach in schools for commoner children. Or become piecework artisans; they could contract with wholesalers (who also lent money) to make fans, umbrellas, insect cages, ink brushes, and the like. Even as most ronin had to fend for themselves in this netherworld, they still were to carry the two swords of their original rank, and to uphold their obligations. Hanshiro and his daughter Miho make umbrellas and fans to sell to wholesalers for a pittance; Hanshiro is in debt to one of the wholesalers. Motome teaches commoner children and receives a minimal wage for his work. Miho and Motome marry and have a son. All goes well until sickness strikes. Miho contracts consumption and the child contracts a fever. Neither Hanshiro nor Motome can afford a doctor. Motome attempts to get a laborer job (which pays more than teaching does) and runs straight into job discrimination: ""no starving ronin need apply."" Motome sells his sword blades at a pawnshop, obtaining bamboo blades to wear inside his sword fittings, not an uncommon practice; some ronin (and some low-ranked clan samurai) desperately needed money. And yet, the sword was considered to be ""the soul of the bushi."" A bushi who sold his blades had to appear to wear the badge of his rank. The bamboo blades were available, thus no one would know of the despicable act of having sold his ""soul"" for money.But Motome has not received enough; he still cannot afford a doctor. So Motome decides on something more desperate: to appear at a clan gate, with his hidden bamboo blades, in order to request seppuku -- with the actual intention of receiving a handout to get a doctor for his wife and child. The Ii clan officials have decided differently. The scene where Motome must commit seppuku with his bamboo wakizashi is one of the most harrowing scenes ever filmed. Motome is utterly humiliated, surrounded by the Ii clan retainers, with Onodaka Hikokuro, his assigned second preaching on how the sword is the soul of the samurai, the bamboo sword is what is appropriate for Motome, and so forth. While Motome painfully carries forth. Hikokuro refuses Motome's request to cut off his head and end the ritual's mockery, so Motome ends it himself, biting off his tongue. Hanshiro has realized -- too late -- that he had never dared to even consider selling his own sword blades to help out the family. The scene when he is confronted with Motome's body and the truth of what has happened is truly gut-wrenching, as Hanshiro weeps and slams down his ""useless tokens"" that he had clung to. Hanshiro reveals his own secret  he has used his ""useless tokens"" to avenge Motome's death. He has tracked down the three Ii retainers who were most responsible for Motome's death. The final duel between Hanshiro and Onodaka Hikokuro is absolutely stunning. Instead of taking the lives of these three, Hanshiro has taken their topknots. And while Kageyu has preached to Hanshiro about samurai honor, these three swordsmen have hidden themselves away, claiming sickness to cover up their own shame, while their topknots grow back. Kageyu cannot deal with Hanshiro's revelations. He commands his men to slaughter Hanshiro. Hanshiro fights back gamely, taking four of the Ii clan retainers and wounding several more. In a symbolic scene, he tears down the ancestral armor of the Ii clan. Some Ii clansmen use their rifles against Hanshiro, but Hanshiro sticks his own sword into his belly, committing seppuku as he has pledged to do. In the end, Kageyu fashions a cover-up of the entire event; mysterious plagues have hit the Ii clan and a number of their retainers, including Onodaka, have died of ""illness"" rather than by the blade of an impoverished hungry ronin. This film raises many issues. It is Kobayashi's impassioned protest against rigidly militaristic societies that uphold hypocritical codes of ""bushido"" while disdaining what that term really means. The film is also like a Greek tragedy, with a character (Tsugumo Hanshiro) possessing the tragic flaw of his own pride -- which in the end, he must pay for with his life. Which he does in a heroic way. This film doesn't just recount the oppression of poor people. It shows the strength that these poor people have, the choices that they make as individuals, refusing to just bow down and be mere victims of their society.","

"Harakiri","claszdsburrogato","2 December 2023","Harakiri is the highest-rated film on Letterboxd, but does it deserve such praise? In my opinion, it is a masterpiece. One of the best films in history. Harakiri explores a fascinating narrative. The character development throughout the plot, told in a non-linear way, flows in a phenomenal way. We are introduced to a cizudo character, who seems to have no emotions and someone who has been through a lot of things. Then, during a flashback, we watch the story of a young man who seems innocent and lost in life. It's a cruel film, which doesn't succeed in shocking you visually if necessary for the narrative. It's incredible to follow the protagonist's story and see him go through different moments in his life. Happiness, despair and revenge. Harakiri is a masterpiece of cinema.","

Nor am I proud that not only have I spent so many years of my life in front of a flickering screen but that I actually know the number of films that I have seen.With that said, ""Seppuku"" (""Hara-kiri"") makes that whole trip worth while. For every hundred pieces of celluloid tripe you can be fortunate to find a diamond in the rough and for me that was my first experience with this Kobayashi masterpiece. Pure enjoyment, pure excitement.The film is brilliantly constructed and multi-layered in such a way that the film defies genre classification. To call it a ""samurai film"" is akin to categorizing ""Psycho"" as a murder mystery. ""Seppuku"" could easily slide into the mystery, suspense, drama, or western genres and feel right at home. Perhaps an eastern film noir, if you will.Kobayashi's telling of the tale incorporates elements of despair, tradition, fortitude, revenge but mostly love, pride and honor in a grand visual style.The story's setting, direction and Tatsuya Nakadai's strong performance invite the inevitable comparison to Kurosawa and his favorite samurai Toshiro Mifune. All are of such high merit that I would propose ignoring the temptation to compare and appreciate the genius involved in ""Seppuku"".For those who have not seen ""Seppuku"" of course I strongly recommend that you do so but I also suggest that you avoid reading any synopsis and take delight in watching the tale unfold.10/10 (and not too many of the 6,035 are 10's)","

"Harakiri","lee_eisenberg","30 September 2022","One of the major players in Japanese cinema in the post-war era was Masaki Kobayashi. I should admit that ""Seppuku"" (""Harakiri"" in English) is the first of his movies that I've seen. Basically, it's an indictment of feudal hypocrisy, and also a warning about over-idealizing history. Rather than simply a samurai movie, this is an anti-samurai movie. The protagonist is a ronin (a samurai without a leader) in a peacetime era in Japan's history. Coming to an estate, he hopes to take his own life, but this is merely the jumping-off point for a long, complex story.In addition to the acting and directing, the viewer should pay attention to the sets. They're arranged so as to establish a mood. The Criterion DVD includes interviews with the director, screenwriter and star, all of whom talk about the challenges of making the movie. Kobayashi had anti-authoritarian tendencies, and these come out in the movie, with its challenge to militarism and entrenched power. Basically, to dislike this movie is to have no humanity.All in all, it's no surprise that ""Harakiri"" often turns up on the lists of the greatest movies of all time. If you consider yourself a film buff, then you owe it to yourself to see this movie.","

"Harakiri","cwkenreich","9 June 2021","Harakiri is an outsatanding and underrated Japanese masterpiece. It seems to be heavily overshadowed by so-called magnum opuses like seven samurai. However, this samurai film was truly incredible in almost every way. The visuals and the themes complimented each other perfectly. It really shed light on the samurai experience like no film before and subverts expectations with regards to numerous samurai cliches.The recurring mood of this movie is deceitful. Nothing should be interpreted at face value. Our protagonist Tsugumo enters seemingly disturbing the peace at the honorable House of Iyi. He even wears a dark outfit, deceiving one into thinking that he is evil in nature. One would expect that Tsugumo would promptly carry out his ""wish"" of dying honorably. Given that we know nothing about him and that the camera often keeps physical distance from him, he initially does not evoke pity. However he repeatedly prolongs the ritual, much to the annoyance of Sennukko. And Tsugumo finally tells his grand tale which subverts all of our expectations. It's revealed that he is the victim of corrupt government policies initiated by indifferent upper-class elites. He is really out to vent his grievances in front members of the elite.But the film doesn't stop there. Part of its magic was just truly how unpredictable it was. Not only was Tsugumo lying in his intentions, he revealed that three of his proposed ""seconds"" to his harakiri were not sick at all, but could not face the humiliation of losing their buns. The final lines in the film in which sennukko orders the events of the film to be whitewashed to preserve the House's dignity, accentuates the theme of subversion. This is supported when the camera cuts at some of the most climactic moments. While not my original observation, I'd like to echo other reviews in acknowledging how in every death or samurai battle, we never actually see anyone die, or have their hair cut off. It's as if the audience is denied the convenience of being eyewitnesses and instead must accept Sennukko's words with submission.I've read how this film, while taking place in the 17th century, has striking parallels to Japanese institutions during WWII, however I admit to being no aficionado on Japanese history.This was my interpretation of the film. Samurais are often depicted as saviors and honorable warriors (ahem all of kurosawa's films), but this interpretation of them has to be the most pitiful and revealing.In terms of entertainment value, this film was easily 10/10. We grow intrigued as our bereaved protagonist asks to commit ritual suicide after facing poverty. We then have to witness the cringy demise of one previous man named Chijiwa. As we are awaiting Tsugumo to succumb to the same fate, he creates tension by interrupting the procedure with his own anecdotes, where we learn an emotional backstory surrounding the loss of his job and ALL of his immediate family. As if this weren't intriguing enough, the suspense is cranked up when Tsugumo reveals how he retrieved the hair buns and preaches about the evil workings of the ruling class. The ending is a well earned and a well executed climax of realistic and authentic fight choreography for the time the film was made.Again, I don't know how historically accurate this film was and I'm certain many inevitably dismissed it as political propaganda, but the execution of this movie from a filmmaking standard was near meticulous in my opinion.Best Samurai film and probably the best foreign film I've ever seen! 10/10.","

The samurai who espouse this code are depicted as either malicious or enslaved by its snare - reduced to begging or arbitrarily enforcing it as a tool of humiliation. The story unfolds in a gradual way, revealing how all the characters have interacted in the past, bringing a lot of context to the situation in the courtyard. This is all punctuated with skillful cinematography of claustrophobic architecture, heartfelt acting and desperate swordfights.","

There is suspicion from the beginning when he is asked if he really ants to perform harakiri or if he simply wants money or a job. The counselor asks him this and Hanshiro replies the same answer that his son in law, Motome, did when he came in search for an open hand. Through Hanshiro's story telling, we are able to see the true meaning for why he is there; revenge for his lost family. Althpugh his intention is not on killing them, he simply wants them to acknowledge the unethical way they went about with Motome. In the beginning of them movie, the Iyi Clan armor is depicted as honorable, brave and even a little frightening however after the plot uncovers how the samurai retainers acted, the armor becomes an insignificant and worthless statue.","

Arriving in a white case with the title in small font, I put it on the end of a shelf before leaving,where it remained lost for years! Rearranging things during Lockdown, I was surprised to discover that this film had been facing me the whole time.View on the film:Bringing the sword down on this adaptation of Yasuhiko Takiguchi's novel by titling Hanshiro Tsugumo ""The ronin from Hiroshima"", the screenplay by Shinobu Hashimoto brings the defiance against authority in post-WWII Japan to the early beginnings, of what would become a consolidation of power, leading to the 250 year Tokugawa reign.Seating Hanshiro face to face with Saito in the house of Li Clan palace, the poetic dialogue Hashimoto balances the blade with the refine allegorical brutal, feudal authority of the Li Clan being used to rip the other clans and samurai's of the land apart, leading to Hashimoto striking back,and exposing the fragility from shattering their orders.Bringing Hanshiro into the palace pledging to commit harakiri, Hashimoto skilfully blades the allegorical with a absolutely thrilling samurai tale, drawing Hanshiro's compassion for his family with a fierce, passionate fire to fight and save the individualism of his family, up against the authoritative band of Li Clan.Saying later in a interview with Joan Mellen in 1972 that ""In any era, I am critical of authoritarian power."" directing auteur Masaki Kobayashi reunites with cinematographer Yoshio Miyajima, and stylishly displays his rebellion against authoritarian rule with the empty suit of armor hanging above the Li Clan palace like a gargoyle, which Kobayashi brings crashing down to earth via Hanshiro throwing the façade of power from the armor,right back at Li Clan.Cutting Toru Takemitsu's score to sparse inserts, Kobayashi displays a expertise in the use of silence, filling the Li Clan palace with Hanshiro's anguished words, being only interrupted by the lone sound of wooden panels being stepped on as guards rush to Saito's side.Igniting a lit fuse atmosphere which ends in a thrilling final fight, (where real swords were used!) that breaks the walls of the Li Clan palace, Kobayashi begins to shake the foundation with long static camera shots a few feet from the floor listening to Hanshiro, that Kobayashi starkly cracks with tightened close-ups on Hanshiro's agonised face,and refined zoom-ins on the terror sinking into Saito's face.Reuniting with Kobayashi,Tatsuya Nakadai gives a incredibly raw performance as Hanshiro, thanks to the love and warmth Hanshiro gives to his family, being contrasted by Nakadai with a simmering rage to fight for freedom freed from harakiri","

"Harakiri","planktonrules","15 October 2006","This film was very well-made and the story is excellent. The story begins with a man asking his local warlord permission to commit ritual suicide. His reason is that the country has been at peace so long that ronin (out of work and master-less Samurai) have no income and nothing to do. So, instead of the indignity of just wasting away, a vicious and painful suicide is apparently the best option! Instead of instantly granting this request, the Counselor tells the suicidal ronin about a similar request that occurred recently and how the ronin who killed himself probably only asked for permission to die as a ruse to get money from the warlord! In other words, this other man had hoped that his request would NOT be granted and he would instead been given a small income. But, not wanting to see the Bushido code perverted, the warlord demanded that this man commit ritual suicide--even though the sword the ronin had was made of bamboo and doing the painful ritual was super-painful and difficult with such a sword.This story was pretty interesting but how it related to this second ronin is what makes this story so interesting. Plus, I loved how the story ended.Overall, I think this is a bit of an ""anti-Samurai"" film, as it talked how adherence to the rules of Bushido actually could be very cruel and violate the spirit of the feudal system. The inherent cruelty and desire to only worry about appearances instead of right and wrong make this an excellent and intriguing movie. Good stuff.","

Masaki Kobayashi does an extraordinary job of incorporating western elements along with typical Japanese humor and vengeance, to deliver one of the key Jidai-Geki films in the history of Japanese cinema. The central idea of the film is to expose the audience to the egotistical, dishonorable side of the samurai, and does so by following Hanshiro (the protagonist) as he calls out the Iyi Clan for disobeying the Bushido Code. Samurai's live off honor, but in a world full of war and violence, this film proves that all morals and honor can be lost, and reveals the sick ways that people go about getting a form of entertainment.","

A spectacular tragic mystery builds up with tremendous pace to the point you feel this nearly 2hr20min is just 90 minutes of pure, unfiltered samurai intrigue. This film is one of the few I would personally break the scale for and give an 11/10. Beyond perfection. Pretty much to the point of transcending our reality as it has long since transcended the film medium to become the Ronin gospel. The lead actor gives a haunting performance that has lingered in my mind for awhile and is the main reason I am writing this review. It simply must be seen by anybody who likes good movies... that's everyone last I checked.","

"Harakiri","Koundinya","23 June 2012","While Japanese movies are synonymous to Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune, this movie has neither of them. It's an unprecedented movie that leaves you brood over the plight of the once-great-warriors of the medieval Japan. The movie is aided by brilliant handling of the camera and loud yet powerful background music. The duel between Tsugumo and Omodaka set in the backdrop of plains with bushes ruffling against the gale was the most impressive scenes in the movie.Samurais, warriors known for their fighting skills and adept wielders of sword, are unemployed and are forced to live in penury after their clans make truce. They even struggle to get a job with workers demanding samurais not be employed. They resort to threatening other clans by saying they'd perform ancient religious practice of Hara-kiri, which is to disembowel oneself, if they are not awarded with a bounty.One such samurai Tsugumo offers his life to the Lyi clan. He's enlightened with the story of a man who gave exactly the same details as Tsugumo. They narrate the story of a certain Motome, who was so poverty-stricken that he had a bamboo instead of a blade and performs the practice in the most atrocious fashion. Motome's sacrifice served as an example to all those samurais who seek fortune in the name of intimidation to end one's life. Tsugumo confesses he was willing to perform hara-kiri whole-heartedly bu wishes his head be slashed by a great warrior of the clan. The warrior is ill and Tsugumo suggests two more names and all the three men have taken ill. The head of the clan senses Tsugumo's plot to procrastinate. Tsugumo wishes to narrate his story before it's time to enter the other world.He concedes that he and Motome were acquainted. Motome was his son-in-law, who taught in the neighborhood to earn a living. Stricken by poverty and an ailing wife and neonate son in the house, he fails to find a job and even sells his priced sword to earn a little money. He then heads to the Lyi clan to implore for the money but he's forced into performing Hara-kiri. Without medication and care, Tsugumo's daughter and grandson pass on. Tsugumo enlightens the men of the clan what actually happened to the men who responsible for his son-in-law's death in a way. An exasperated head orders Tsugumo be severed by the swords and pierced by spears. Tsugumo resists for a while, takes the life of 4 and lacerates 8 others before he dies.The head of the clan orders the 3 absentees be killed by skilled men and cover up all the killings in the name of illness thereby receiving appreciation from the administration.A 10/10 movie.","

"Harakiri","john_billings19","4 January 2004","Seppuku opens up with a shot of the samurai battle armor. Simply a shell with nothing in it at the time. Seppuku reveals the hypocrisy and emptiness in the samurai code and that things are not always as they seem. It challenges traditional belief of honor and what is to be done and simply not to be done. Through the movie the director leads us into belief that Motome is a bad samurai. He is masterless and furthermore unable to provide for his family. It opens up with his preformed seppuku in which everything goes wrong for Motome, we see his as a horrible honor less samurai. Motome comes to the house obviously to beg for food or money. We see that his swords, the soul of the samuari, were sold for bamboo ones. Than he begs for leave seemingly to run away to not have to perform the seppuku. However, things are not as they seem. Hanshiro shows up to the house of the same group. Than, he tells the story as it actually was. Motome was actually trying to provide for his family. He sold his swords for food and comfort for his dieing wife. Then comes to the house to beg for money only so he can afford a doctor for his dying infant son as well. When Motome begs for leave before his seppuku he actually needs time to go back to his family to tell them that he was unsuccessful in getting money and they would have to find other means. What is more just or had more honor, following the samurai code, or trying to save the lives of your dying family members. The writer answers that later in the movie. Hanshiro defeats every samurai that brought his son in law back to him dead by cutting off their top knots. If the house had the honor that they said they did than these three samurai would commit seppuku. None of the samurai do. They fake an illness so their topknot can grow back. The author shows that the samurai honor is really just a front, it is just an image, like the old samurai battle armor. The code represents who they want to be, but the honor is not there. Seppuku is a great story about hypocrisy and fake honor of the samurai code.","

"Harakiri","Suomi_perkele","8 October 2006","Seppuku or harakiri is a samurai ritual where an elderly samurai cuts his belly open with a small sword and makes a cross in his flesh. After cutting other samurai cuts his head of to end the pain. And like this a samurai will die honorably.Seppuku tells a story of one elderly samurai named Hanshiro Tsugumo who has lots of things to tell before his harakiri. He tells a story about his beautiful daughter and her life. You can tell that the other samurais aren't actually very pleased with his story telling because the man just doesn't know when to stop. When Hanshiro finally finishes his stories there won't be his harakiri. No, then a great battle will begin. The influence of Seppuku in modern cinema is obvious. The final battle sequence is lot like in Kill Bill vol.1. And that's not the only thing that is similar to some movies of this date.Tatsuya Nakadai does great job in Hanshiro's role and the rest of the cast aren't bad either. Visual aspects of Seppuku are beautiful and the movie itself is very tough provoking. Well it's hard for me to put all into words because of the language barrier but I'll just say this: Seppuku is amazingly deep and beautiful movie which criticizes the mindless samurai ritual they call harakiri. I'm sorry I can't say much - after all I am young and Finish so English doesn't come so naturally for me. But It's easy for me to say - go and watch Seppuku, it's truly a great movie.Now it's time for me to watch other movies of Masaki Kobayashi.","

"Harakiri","lasttimeisaw","16 October 2020","""Most actions are confined in the palace's courtyard and other indoor spaces, HARAKIRI flags up Kobayashi's optimal stagecraft, the geometrical blocking of actors, the wide-screen spatial compositions, stationary but never feel constricted; when the actor moves, like in the final one-against-many mêlée, everything is crystallized to a T, the minutely calibrated choreography, the lethal slash and damage caused by the swordplay, and Nakadai's total abandon into a bleeding beast and desperate iconoclast. In a sense, the set piece is even more extraordinary than Kurosawa's best offers in YOJIMNO and SEVEN SAMURAI, because Hanshiro is outnumbered, doomed, a forlorn hope who fights until his last breath, a hero whose valor and integrity will not be extolled but buried, but when the dust settles, we actually feel triumphant for him, what a glorious death!""","

"Harakiri","filipemanuelneto","22 May 2023","In addition to having a very strong film industry, Japan is a country with a very rich past that we in the West tend to devalue. A somewhat ethnocentric attitude, more typical of small minds. For a long time, the Japanese were a people divided by several feudal princes who fought among themselves, disputing power and regional influence. It was in this context, moreover, that the first contact between the Japanese and the Portuguese took place, the first Westerners to disembark, demonstrably (Marco Polo speaks of the Japanese, but he probably never went there), on the islands of Japan, where they took the first firearm, the Christian faith and a strong cultural influence: even today, in the Japanese language, there are hundreds of words directly imported from Portuguese.The film that brought me here tells us about one of the most fascinating traditional figures of Japan: the samurai, a warrior similar, in essence, to the European knight. They were educated people who were willing to live off the war, as paid mercenaries. In a land where each feudal lord wages war for himself, with his own troops and against his neighbors, it was not difficult to live off war. It would be difficult to live in peace! The samurai had a code of conduct, the Bushido, which dictated rules according to which they guided their lives, seeking to live and die with honor. Honor was more important than life and therefore, in certain situations, it was expected that the samurai knew how to die and was willing to do so, even if by his own hands, in a suicide ritual.The film begins when a samurai, left unemployed by a long peace, turns to an old man and asks to be allowed to die. In response, he hears a story that occurred some time before, and in which a samurai in the same situation made an identical request in the expectation of receiving money, and ended up having to commit suicide, and with a wooden weapon. The film then reveals an important fact: this first samurai is the father-in-law of the man who killed himself, and who wanted money to feed his sick wife and son. And in fact that warrior is not there in order to simply die, but in order to avenge the son-in-law wronged by human hypocrisy.The film is quite dense, and the fact that it is so different from Western cinema and, even more so, in black and white, can quite scare the current public. However, it is worth resisting this impulse to reject it and giving the film a chance. It's very well done, it has a pretty good story, which is nothing behind big Hollywood hits. The script takes advantage of the situation to expose the brutality of the rigor imposed on the samurai by means of a moral code so absurdly demanding that it ended up being inhumane. Contrary to what happens in some films, even western ones, this film does a good historical contextualization of the story it tells us, not being too difficult to understand what is at stake. I'm not the best person to talk about the director or the actors, I don't know them, but I can say that we have the participation of Tatsuya Nakadai, Yoshiro Aoki and Akira Ishihama. On a technical level, I think it's impossible to avoid noticing the quality of the sets and filming locations, as well as the sharpness and quality of the cinematography.","

"Harakiri","eddie_baggins","26 October 2020","Firmly entrenched in movie bible IMDB's Top 250 Films of All-Time list, Masaki Kobayashi's anti-samurai film remains to this day a stunningly crafted achievement that subverts its genre's expectations to give us a samurai film that favors talking and mystery over sword play and sensationalising.Set in the 17th century where newfound peace in the Japanese landscape has forced many samurai warriors that were previously hired for their bloodthirsty skill-sets to be forced out of work and large portions of them seeking to perform a ritual suicide known as seppuku, Harakiri (named for its referencing of this suicidal act) introduces us to a samurai clan working in the house of Lord Lyi as the clan plays host to a humiliating act of the seppuku of a young warrior that eventually leads to the arrival of the mysterious Hanshiro Tsugumo who too seeks to perform his last act in the house.Played out at a quiet but steady pace, Yoshio Miyajima steady camera work capturing every moment and Tôru Takemitsu's unnerving and perfectly suited score working alongside it, Harakiri is one of the era's most proficiently constructed affairs that may at times seem as though its headed for predictable outcomes only to change course unexpectedly throughout as its heartbreaking and confronting narrative takes place around Tatsuya Nakadai's tortured and determined Hanshiro.Working as both an unflinching examination of the samurai code and also as an exploration of post Japanese sentiment in the aftermath of their countries moving forward in the wake of World War 2 and their acceptance of long-forged laws, regulations and traditions, Harakiri evolves from its seemingly simplistic set-up to become an allergy and nuanced deep-dive into the countries history while at all times remaining a haunting character examination.Steering well clear of the over acting and hastily put together aspects that haunted many other similar productions and products of this era in general, Kobayashi's guiding hand help craft Harakiri into an ageless and captivating piece of movie-making, with the underrated Nakadai delivering one of Japanese cinema's great leading turns and the collective supporting cast all bringing their characters to life with carefully considered and well attuned performances.Unafraid to explore its dark themes and moments (a drawn out and horrifying suicide at the hand of a bamboo sword is still hard to sit through in today's more tolerant environment), Harakiri is deserving of its lauded reputation, even if many other higher profile ""samurai"" themed films outshine it in the general public spectrum.Final Say -A film best watched with as little knowledge as possible leading into it, Harakiri is a powerful and confronting piece of Japanese cinema that has remained relevant and required viewing these many years on since its release.4 1/2 bamboo knives out of 5","

"Harakiri","fpyqvcc","9 April 2022","Note: Everything I say in this review is simply my opinion and I do not state it as an objective factHara-Kiri is my personal favorite movie that I've ever seen. The only reason I don't give it a solid 10/10 is because I believe a movie can always be at least somewhat better, even if it's only the smallest detail that is changed. But anyway, I love this movie so much and here's what I love about it:First off I love Cinematography/Direction in this movie. There are so many incredible shots that just add so much to the movie. There's the close up, odd angle shots in the scene where Motome commits harakiri, the shots showing Hanshiro unfazed by the clan around him, the shots where the background is just nothingness, directing the audiences eyes to the important foreground with shots such as the ones of the clans armor, Motome's dead body lying in front of Hanshiro and Miho, and Hanshiro stabbing himself, dying honorably after getting what he wants. And there's the wide angle action shots where action and movement are all over the frame. The direction truly brings the script to life.And Secondly, I love the writing of this movie. I find it to make this story be such a mysterious, emotional, and intriguing story. The main character,Hanshiro, I think is extremely well written, how there are two parallel stories of his going on, the story he's telling, showing the tragedy he went through, showing how he went from a fun happy man to being an emotionless expressionless man with only one goal in mind, while the other story is what he goes through in present time, showing him go from an emotionless man to slowly revealing his vengeful yet understandable motive to the clan. And all of this wouldn't have been as good as it was if Tatsuya Nakadai wasn't able to play this character so well. I also love the dialogue in this movie, it doesn't seem like the script was written by a robot. The back and forth between Hanshiro and Saito is like an action scene with words.I also love the poeticness of the movie. I loved the armor, that at first has no seen meaning, there's nothing we know about it, but later we see that it's the corrupt heart of the clan, that Hanshiro, getting to the heart of the clan while breaking down the walls and then ending up on his hands and knees still pursuing the armor, and then getting to it and throwing it on the ground, getting what he wants, to make a fool of and to spit in the face of this evil clan, and the he kills himself, dying honorably, showing us what an honorable death looks like, what an honorable harakiri looks like, not a huge event meant to abuse someone for the sake of ""honor"" but a death accompanied with the success of a plan with a noble cause. And then the clan tries to hide how he's ruined them, getting rid of the blood stained cloths and propping up their clans armor again, with an ending that looks pretty much the same as the beginning, but this time we understand the meaning behind what we see. But it's still an ambiguous ending, did Hanshiro really win? I view it as yes and I think that the ending is meant to show that while they can physically clean their mansion, we have now seen the stain of what they have done which is ultimately what Hanshiro wanted, to expose the corruption of those who caused the death of everyone that mattered to himAnd then just some other smaller things I love in this movie are the score, which can be exciting, shocking, ambiguous, or saddening, but no matter what, it always adds to the scene. I also love the action, I've already said I think the direction adds a lot the action scenes, but I also just think that the action itself is so well choreographed and actually realistic.Verdict: Hara-Kiri is an amazing written and directed movie, that is poetic, exciting, emotional, and intriguing, In my opinion, It is an absolute masterpiece.","

"Harakiri","bkrauser-81-311064","27 March 2016","American ethos has always had a soft-spot for the conscientious objector. We're a nation of fervent individualists and everything from the writings of Mark Twain to the film 12 Angry Men (1957) codifies that idea. The power of an individual against a torrent of common corruption and blind group-think is almost fetishized, especially in contemporary society. The Japanese, generally speaking, don't have such a provocative streak of individualism embedded in their culture. So it's interesting that one of the most eloquent and austerely beautiful films on the subject should come from the land of the rising sun. Harakiri is a repudiation of the collective values of Japan that, on its best days unites a population in tragedy and at its worst marches a people towards war.Hanshiro Tsugumo (Nakadai) is an aging and embittered samurai whose feudal lord has died in battle along with most of his men. In order to reclaim his honor, according to the bushido code, Tsugumo must disembowel himself in a ritual suicide known as seppuku. To do this he arrives at the feet of Saito Kageyu (Mikuni) and asks members of the Iyi daimyo to help him do the ceremony correctly. Kageyu is hesitant as only a few days ago a similar request was made by another ronin who had no intention of committing seppuku but was looking to extort the clan for money. After Kageyu retells the man's tale, which culminates in the ronin dying by the blade of a bamboo sword, Tsugumo insists his intentions are to die with honor. Yet as the pavilion where the deed is to be done is setup, questions remain. What is Tsugumo's connection to the earlier ronin? Why did he pick the courtyard of the Iyi clan out of all others? Finally does he really intent to reclaim his honor, or is there something else going on?Told in a dizzying array of flashbacks and flash-forwards, Harakiri is not a leisurely movie to watch while folding laundry. It demands the attention of the viewer and weaves a complex tale of Hanshiro Tsugumo's home life after the fall of his clan. He's stricken with the most dire poverty, contemplating his daughter's (Iwashita) sale as a concubine and working menial jobs just to get by. His daughter, son-in-law Motome (Ishihama) and infant grandson Kingo are his only solace from a life of dishonor. Their fates become intimately intertwined with Tsugumo and the Iyi clan in unexpected ways and paying close attention to the plot pays off stunningly in the end.In his own quiet and ultimately unsettling way director Masaki Kobayashi strips away the nobility and romanticism commonly associated with feudal Japan. While doing so he implicates the modern audience (at the time the Japanese public circa 1962) in tolerating authoritarianism under the guise of honor. Harakiri recalls and parallels the days of Japanese imperialism and uses a single individual as a means to take apart the misplaced hubris of anyone still beholden to the old guard. Kobayashi himself was drafted in the army during WWII but repeatedly refused promotion beyond that of a private; his own way of fighting corruption, hypocrisy and evil.The film comes to a conclusion so damning and memorable that I dare not ruin the satisfaction of watching it for the first time. Harakiri is an absolute treasure featuring a star turn by Nakadai who first made an indelible mark on Japanese screens in Kobayashi's The Human Condition Trilogy (1959-1961). Here, while playing a character much older than himself, he still has a certain inner- turmoil that channels James Dean with a strong baritone. Finally there's Kobayashi's masterful direction which watches pensively and almost perversely as the jigsaw pieces fall in place.","

"Harakiri","PimpinAinttEasy","6 February 2016","Dear Masaki Kobayashi, I am not a big fan of Japanese cinema or the Samurai genre. I have watched a few Kurosawas and Ozus and that's it. But things might change with Hara-Kiri which must be one of the greatest revenge films of all time.Your film was was riveting. Objectively speaking, this is one of the best films I've watched in my life. But then I'm a really subjective movie watcher.I really enjoyed the quite beginning. With people walking whisperingly across corridors. I also enjoyed the formal, hierarchical and ritualistic nature of the interactions between various characters and the storytelling. There is something very precise about the way each shot is framed - the men sitting in straight lines ready to attack, the way various objects are placed and also the interiors of the house of Iyi.The first Hara-Kiri scene of Motome Chijiiwa was cruel and sickening. The film is a suspenseful revenge thriller with lots of drama and social commentary.I'm sure the final sword fight scene inspired the one in Old Boy. And this film must have in someway inspired The Hateful Eight - men taking each other on in a really closed space, narrating stories etc.I wasn't that impressed by Tatsuya Nakadai. His beard seemed a bit artificial. I was also a bit bored in the middle when Tsugumo narrates the story of his daughter and her child.But these are minor charges.Best Regards, Pimpin.(9/10)","

"Harakiri","Cosmoeticadotcom","7 June 2012","The film that Harakiri shares the most cinematic DNA with is Kurosawa's The Bad Sleep Well. In a sense, that film is the modern retelling of this film, wherein a vengeance seeking hero plots to destroy his tormentors, only to have him end up dying, as well as having the real truth expunged. But, along with that film, Harakiri never errs by making its politics lead its art around. From the almost exact repetitions of the early actions of Chijiwa and Tsugumo in the Iyi house, to the repetition of the samurai armor to start and end the film, there is no doubt that politics is merely a weapon in the artistic arsenal; it is not its raison d'etre. But, the film also shares much artistry and narrative technique in common with Kurosawa's more placid Ikiru, which also has a large portion of its ending consist of characters relating flashbacks of what happened to the film's lead character. That this dialogue intensity occurs in a samurai film is unusual, but only at first blush, since Harakiri is, in reality, as much of a samurai film as Stanley Kubrick's Paths Of Glory can be called a 'war' film. And, like films like The Wild Bunch and Once Upoin A Time In The West, Harakiri ends with a symbolic foreshadow of the future of the nation it's set in. It is no happenstance that the rogue ronin Tsugumo is not felled by another's sword, but only by guns, for that was the way the Tokugawa Shogunate, the ultimate bad guy in this film, was to fall almost 240 years later.The Human Condition ultimately missed out on greatness because of its length and overarching ambition, which sometimes obfuscated points that should have rung clarion. Harakiri does not suffer that ill. It is a deft lightning strike at its target, and as such delivers a killer blow. It also shows that Japan's filmic legacy, in the 20th Century, was more than its Big Three directors, Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, and Kenji Mizoguchi. Masaki Kobayashi seems to be every bit their equal, and, along with Kon Ichikawa, Hiroshi Teshigahara, Shohei Imammura, Nagisa Oshima, and Mikio Naruse, the middle part of the last century seems to have been, for Japanese film, one of the most Golden of Golden Ages any country has experienced in any art form.

"Harakiri","sharky_55","29 March 2016","The first shot of Harakiri is an imposing suit of samurai armour, seated on a bench amongst cinematic coils of smoke in the air. I say seating, because despite its hollowness, it's posture is imposingly life-like, almost as if at the call of war it would come to life and march off to battle. This must be how the Ii clan see this glorious suit of armour; even in peacetime it is more than just a tool for means of driving back enemies, but a symbol for honour, strength, loyalty and absolute morality. Of course as they prosper, the peacetime has released many ronin, now master-less and without a trade or living, into the wild wandering. This is really a film for a repeat watch. On first impression, Motome's pleas seem a little self-fulfilling, because why would a samurai committed to seppuku want a two day respite if they have renounced everything and are ready to die? His actual act of seppuku too, is extremely hard to watch - Kobayashi doesn't need to show actually graphic penetration because Ishihama's agony is so anguishing to witness. And yet, there is a hint of comeuppance, because it seems phony that a samurai would carry around a fake, bamboo version of his livelihood. On a second watch, these scenes are filled with such a tragic desperation once we know the back-story. The blunt, ironic cruelty of the bamboo strikes becomes heartbreaking because he has already sold his real blades for his family - what is a samurai without his blade? We know without a doubt he would return in two days this time. Doubly so, Hanshiro weeps because he has kept his own blade, foolishly holding onto a past relic much like the witnesses around him do so. Kobayashi has maintained such a steady, tense rhythm throughout the two hours and 13 minutes. Not once is there a line of misplaced dialogue, or a glance that was not filled with the appropriate amount of venom. We see one 'extortion' attempt, and then another from Hanshiro, so of course we await some sort of twist or connection. There is no sense of contrivance when he delays the act, no sense of artificial direction behind these characters. Tatsuya Nakadai is effortless. He has the knack for transforming so seamlessly into his character and becoming every ounce of them - here it is in his blank, almost traumatised expression as he narrates; it could not be more immediately obvious that this is a man who has lost everything. And then there is the little remaining spark underneath that drives this tale of revenge (his cackles as he bemusedly wonders on the fate of three men he has already taken care of), although it seems more vital to expose the Ii clan for the facade that they uphold. The framing device of the narration of the guest book is what seals it. It simultaneously empowers and suppresses the events of the film; even as we witness the despair of Saito, having his pretense so viciously and comprehensively demolished, he quickly rewrites the history books because he has that power (there's a cruel irony to the way he orders the forced seppuku of the three disgraced warriors - the noble ritual being marred). That stirring, dramatic duel in the windswept plains, gone. That desperate, climatic battle, where we might conventionally expect a one-man massacre and a little poetic justice, gone. And even as he attempts to go out on his own terms, Hanshiro is shot by a modernised death-dealer. It recalls Kurosawa's Yojimbo, in which it was actually Nakadai who wielded the gun and brought forth the end of the age of samurai. But here, it becomes a more potent, universally symbolic end. This cruel world does not bend to sentiment. Appearances must be upheld, even sometimes in the face of moral transgression. Hanshiro smashes the suit of armour, but it is gleaming and whole again soon. But it is of course a hollow ideal. All the honour in the world could not materialise a decent man to fill its shoes.","

"Harakiri","francescopiogrimaldi","17 May 2022","Hara-kiri is a story that seems to start having already finished, with a Ronin who chooses to die.And it is in that moment, when you realize the protagonist's concrete desire to pass away, that you wonder how such a story can go on, when in fact a surrender appears at the gates of the Iyi family.And it is in that moment that the direction of Kobayashi, with its wonderful and tragic aesthetics, together with the script by Hashimoto, decides to tell you the story of that story that you had seen up to that moment.Step by step you understand, through an alternation of delicate and studied narrative lines, able to load every single shot with drama and to denounce that Japanese system of the 17th century that still persists to this day.That social paradox, made up of abuses of power and arrogance by the 'Lords', which takes away dignity from humble people, the same ones who will then be condemned to judgment and labels. Tarnish the memory of a person considered 'nobody' by others, when he/she, on the other hand, was loved and loved by the people who surrounded him/her.Hara-kiri is not just a film about Samurai, it is a film that tells about everyday life and how this is then inexorably declined for a system that works badly, that makes you remain alone, that kills even before a Katana with bamboo blade pierces you, with prying eyes and humiliation from those who believe themselves superior to such an extent that they can teach an exemplary lesson.Thanks Kobayashi, you are the origin of the films I loved. Your cinematographic and at times theatrical direction is shocking, capable of making me fall in love with cinema again with a single zoom or with a single connection of gaze.","

"Harakiri","net_orders","16 July 2016","Viewed on DVD. Restoration = ten (10) stars. This is a melodramatic tale set in Japan's early 1600's. It was a time of major societal disruption when unemployed samurai (known as ""ronin"") became a major problem with the ""peaceful"" unification of Japan under one emperor. Ronin lacked few (if any) skills transferable to civilian life. Their rigid adherence to the ""samurai code of honor"" did not help matters. They become dependent on handouts (sometimes coerced and gained by trickery). The director spins a story to illustrate how a military honor code ingrained over hundreds of years can rapidly become dysfunctional and of little practical use when the zeitgeist changes. The point being that outside of military life and its sponsors, the samurai code is really a ""facade."" Direction is seamless and creative: most of the film uses a single set, but the viewer scarcely notices this and is rarely bored (the movie, however, is a bit too long). Acting by Tatsuya Nakadai is a wonder to behold, and arguably the best brought to the ""classical"" Japanese cinema. The score is stark (mostly consisting of what sounds like a single got-tan), but effective. Cinematography (black and white, wide screen) is excellent with scene lighting adding much to driving the film's theme home to the viewer. Set decoration is appropriately sparse with many interiors either shot on location or carefully recreated in a studio setting. Subtitles leave a lot to be desired. They are usually too long with the title writer taking great liberties when translating line readings. Once again Criterion restoration engineers seem to take delight in harassing the viewer when s/he tries to turn on/off subtitles (you never know what to expect until restarting the film).

"Harakiri","grantss","26 May 2019","A samurai, Hanshiro Tsugumo, arrives at the house of the Iyi Clan with an unusual request. Due to his circumstances, he wishes to commit harakiri, ritual suicide, in the courtyard of the house. Turns out this is not such an unusual request: the clan has had such requests before, though the requestor's intentions weren't always honourable. The Clan elder tells Tsugumo the story of the last samurai who made the request and how that ended. Will he still go through with it?Not your average samurai drama. Slow-burning, plot-filled and relatively light on action, this movie will come as a bit of a surprise to most. This doesn't make it less interesting though. In fact, it makes it better.Instead of a basic plot that's just an excuse for heap of well-choreographed action scenes, the plot here is great, and quite poignant. The action is held back until the end, heightening the anticipation. The action scenes themselves are quite realistic - none of the ridiculous Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon stuff - and have a plausible outcome.On the negative side, the slow-burn does get drawn out a touch too long. In addition, in the end there's no clear message - the conclusion is a bit flat.Overall, a great movie.","

"Harakiri","VikingBurialService","7 February 2022","To me, this is the greatest slow-build of suspense in any movie ever. It's like watching an Alfred Hitchcock movie, but it's a samurai period piece. It breaks the expectations of its genre by focusing more on dialogue than sword fighting. In a lot of ways, it feels like watching a horror movie.Story/Plot/Pacing: Basically, a masterless samurai shows up at a daimyo in Edo asking to commit Hara-Kiri in their courtyard. Right off the bat the music and the story clue you in that there's more history and motivations at play, and throughout the movie the tension between the samurai and the other members of the daimyo builds. The only slow-ish part is in the middle, when he's telling his family's story. It drags on a little, but I can excuse it as slowly building anticipation for what's going to happen, especially on the second viewing.Visuals/Cinematography: The set/costume design is great, but what really stands out is the camera work. Almost all the shots are stable, and the camera almost never moved. In the select few moments it does, it only helps build the tension.Characters: Good. Not 'outstanding' but good. I think the main character is the best - he plays a grieving/maddened father/grandfather well, and the way his voice switches volume/power keeps me on edge. The other actors did a fine job. No standouts, but nothing that dragged me out of the moment.Dialogue: Can't speak perfectly to this, since it's subtitled. There's plenty of exposition, but that's more common in Japanese films I think, and it seems to work here.Theme/Tone: Obviously honor, and the contradiction between doing what is morally honorable versus doing what is honorable based on written/societal codes. Very critical of authority.Score: The score isn't memorable (and I can't find it anywhere) but it fits perfectly with the movie. Basically it's traditional Japanese instruments that play sharply/suddenly whenever there's tension. It's used sparingly, and contrasts well with the long moments of silence or dialogue.","

I thought the movie was great. I thought `Hara-kiri' was very well written and well developed. I originally thought I was in for another Asian samurai movie filled with sword swinging, kung fu action, but it was so much more than that. It was a movie that shined a light on Japanese traditions and the hypocrisy of those in authoritative places. I really enjoyed the movie. It was one of those movies that if you fell to sleep on it or weren't paying attention you couldn't just fall back in line and think you could still follow the story. There was so much going on that you just wanted to give it all your attention. I enjoyed it because even though it `Die Hard' action packed, it still captured you. To one who knows that `hara-kiri' refers to suicide, you would probably assume that the movie would be grim and coarse. However, it was absolutely the opposite. It was a movie that really helped me to appreciate the strong and noble traditions of ancient Japan.","

When the country dishonors its Samurai, and they are driven to acts of desperation, leading to cruelty and further dishonor, the country spirals, and this movie set in 17th century seems to reflect decline in then present day (1962) Japan.The movie is quite beautiful visually, with traditional Japanese architecture and at one point a swaying bamboo forest framed beautifully by director Masaki Kobayashi. The story is taut and works on many levels, first and foremost as a vengeance with honor tale, which might remind you of an American Western, including a couple of epic battle scenes. It also has the individual man, disillusioned and saying that the Samurai code he lives by is a façade, and yet acting honorably, against a multitude misled by corrupt leaders. It's one against many in a battle that is timeless and certainly relevant today, and whose results are sadly akin to the entropy of the universe. ""Who can know the depths of another man's heart?"" the Samurai asks, signaling a need for empathy. Indeed.","

Still, despite those problems, the overall experience remained very powerful and memorable. Indeed, this is one of those movies that I will never forget.One thing that I love about Japanese movies is the fact that they are slow paced and allow the film to really breathe though.

As the main character tells his story you feel more for his pain than nearly Kurosawa movie. For years, I thought Akira Kurosawa was the end all for truly great cinema, but after seeing Kobayashi's opus in Seppuku, it is obvious that 1960's Japanese Cinema had two masters.Seppuku is certainly one of those flicks that makes you say ""Oh SH*T"" halfway through. A deep and enriching story that just keeps getting better as more of the movie is revealed to you. While it doesn't reveal itself to you in a normal unraveling, but rather with a wonderfully told and filmed flashback (while admiringly very long and drawn out - even characters in the film call it so).Everything from the beautiful camera work to the acting delivery is absolutely superb. The close-ups within the flick actually deliver a wealth of information about the scenes that spoken words could only touch on. Truly a masterpiece and worth the wait from Netflix.","

"Harakiri","sandnair87","18 January 2016","Samurai films, like westerns, need not be familiar genre stories. They can expand to contain stories of ethical challenges and human tragedy. 'Harakiri', a shining example of the kind, is about one samurai who takes his time to create an unanswerable dilemma for the elder of a powerful clan. By playing strictly within the rules of Bushido Code which governs the conduct of all samurai, he lures the powerful leader into a situation where sheer naked logic leaves him humiliated before his retainers.The story is set in a time when feudal Japan is at peace, and starving out-of-work samurai beg to perform ritual suicide or 'hara-kiri' at the mansions of powerful clans - a request they hope will lead to a charitable pittance or a menial job. One such lone ronin arrives at the temple of Lord Iyi and asks to use the courtyard to perform honorable ritual self-disembowelment, hara-kiri or seppuku. That seems like the beginning and the end of this movie, all in one: a checkmate. But director Masaki Kobayashi instead constructs a masterful chess game, filled with many carefully constructed moves, each arranged to fit in a particular place - it's glorious to behold!Thus, it would be foolish to give away too much. But the ronin Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) has chosen this particular temple for a very grievous personal reason. His hara-kiri is postponed when, kneeling on the white-sheeted death platform, he requests one after another, three separate house retainers serve as seconds to cut off his head. All three so indisposed as to be unable to attend, the ronin then begs a moment of time to tell his story. Like a brilliant player, he leaves out crucial details until the most opportune moments.The movie openly depicts vanity and corruption among the samurai class, showing that the Lord is more concerned with his reputation than with actual samurai honor. The film has a steady, hypnotic momentum; Kobayashi, wrings as much drama out of facial twitches as he does out of sword fights which are all elegantly composed and photographed to reflect the values it contains. He's helped immensely by Nakadai's molten central performance and the spare, disquieting music. Using superb architectural compositions, Mr. Kobayashi achieves a sort of visual mesmerization that is suitable to the curious nightmare mood.In the end, ""Harakiri"" goes well beyond the usual genre trappings to beautifully underline its recurring theme - that fanatic adherence to codes of honor, by granting them a value greater than life itself, sets up a situation where humanitarian values are forbidden.","

In Seppuku (1962), the ritual shows us humanity in its most raw and vulnerable form; perhaps, it is just before death when one's truest colors shine through. The film is a masterclass in portraying the human condition while showcasing some of the best cinematography and direction I've ever seen in a film. Literally every frame (with its perfect lighting, blocking and composition) is like a painting come to life, just perfect. Masaki Kobayashi paces this film perfectly and keeps you engrossed with one of the most beautiful and incisive pieces of human drama I've ever seen. Once the film receives about 1,000 or so more ratings on IMDb, you'll see this gem shoot up to the top 50 easily.

An older warrior, Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) seeks admission to the home of a feudal lord to commit the act. There, he learns of the fate of his son-in-law, a young samurai who sought work at home, but was savagely forced to commit traditional hara-kiri in a painful way with a blind bamboo blade.

The secure but lonely life of an old warrior and his daughter are like a house built on sand and when the wind of change blows there is a stench from the  injustice and apathy from other samurai who stilll sleep in the illusion of their usefulness.   And no, this film is not about revenge, swords and just killing, in fact the action is so concentrated and sudden it's role is to  jar the audience out of the spell the director and actors and actresses cast and screams ""this is it, it's the end, it's real, and you'll remember every second forever'.","

I just can't sink into their ways of life and the world of 17th century Japan. However, Masaki Kobayashi's Harakiri totally subverts and questions everything they stand for in a compelling way. It's a study of the human condition in samurai form, naturally from the director of the epic saga The Human Condition, of which I need to finish after being impressed by the first part. It's a dissection of the metaphysical ideas of honour that bind the traditions of these men. While they try to commit to formalities, in the face of conflict they find it impossible. The story unravels like a psychological thriller although it's largely formed of flashbacks and talking but the connections that are drawn and the way the film blossoms to its explosive final 15 minutes is extraordinary. A suicide narrative like this is difficult, what are the stakes and what are the motives? Harakiri keeps you guessing, thanks to the incredible performances and when you feel like you've got it figured out, the whole picture changes. With its stark widescreen cinematography and disconcerting score, its technical aspects bolster the experience. It's a film that works on all levels, Harakiri is certainly the best Japanese film I've seen so far.9/10","

"Harakiri","kaaffilm","27 March 2023","""Harakiri"" (1962), directed by Masaki Kobayashi, is a powerful and gripping tale that explores themes of honor, duty, and the corrupting nature of power. Set in the 17th century, the film tells the story of a ronin, or masterless samurai, who arrives at the estate of a powerful lord seeking to perform harakiri, a ritual suicide, as a means of protesting the lord's oppressive regime.From the opening scene, ""Harakiri"" is an intense and emotionally charged film that masterfully weaves together the past and present to tell a poignant story about the struggles of marginalized people in feudal Japan. Kobayashi's direction is impeccable, drawing out strong performances from the entire cast and bringing to life the complex characterizations of the film's protagonists and antagonists.One of the film's greatest strengths is its ability to challenge traditional notions of samurai honor and morality, presenting a starkly realistic portrayal of the brutal realities of life in feudal Japan. The film's themes of social injustice and political corruption remain relevant today, making ""Harakiri"" a timeless masterpiece that continues to resonate with audiences around the world.Overall, ""Harakiri"" is a deeply moving and thought-provoking film that showcases Kobayashi's masterful storytelling and brings to life a fascinating and complex period in Japanese history. It is a must-see for fans of Japanese cinema, and for anyone interested in exploring the depths of human nature and the power of redemption.","

"Harakiri","SaidNDone","20 September 2020","The first thought I had after finishing Harakiri was that I had just watched a Greek tragedy. Every aesthetic element of Harakiri from the empty scenery to the haunting soundtrack is stripped bare, sharpening the viewer's focus onto the human elements in Tsugumo's description of how his family was led to its fate by the hypocrisy of the Shogunate's hierarchy.The brilliance of the movie isn't in its relatively simplistic plot, but rather in the way it makes use of Tsugumo's framed story to detail the impact social codes have on those left behind by society's unfeeling march forward.As Tsugumo tells his story to an increasingly hostile audience, each scene serves to add further evidence to his point - which is the inherent cruelty in applying an unfeeling Samurai ""honor"" code to a messy reality. This goes on until the final act, in which he brilliantly exposes the tie between honor and the Samurai's most sacred symbols as a facade.In the final act, Tsugumo breaks the Imagawa Clan's self-righteous view of themselves with two actions. The first occurs in the final moments of his frame story, where he inverts the traditional relationship between a Samurai's sword and honor - turning Chijiwa's Bamboo sword, which was previously a symbol of dishonor into a symbol of familial loyalty/love. The second occurs after the Imagawa Clan rejects Tsugumo's message - as their leaders are shown to be dishonorable according to their own honor code and the clan's ancestral armor is desecrated during the final fight, which culminates in the Clan resorting to the use of firearms (over their sacred swords) to take down Tsugumo.But as mentioned earlier, society grinds on, and the now disgraced clan cover up both Tsugumo's tragedy and their own dishonor with the stroke of a pen. The question is - will the Clan heed Tsugumo's advice when the wheels of history inevitably turn them to Ronin?","

"Harakiri","dr_foreman","22 January 2008","While some so-called classics leave me cold, ""Harakiri"" (as it's known in the USA) really fires my imagination. This is a rare movie - the kind that I just can't stop recommending to people.Much of the film's appeal is based on surprising narrative twists, so I'm reluctant to delve too deeply into the plot here. But the basic setup is as follows - Japan has entered a time of peace, and consequently many samurai are unemployed and suffering in extreme poverty. Some samurai develop a ploy of threatening to commit suicide, but only so they can get sympathetic handouts of food and money from rich families. The film explores what happens when that ploy backfires in a very serious way.Director Masaki Kobayashi paces the film very slowly - by comparison, many Kurosawa and even Ozu films are breezy, and of course contemporary American films move approximately 800x faster. However, I am never really bored while watching ""Harakiri""; the film slowly builds toward a (very rewarding) climax, while filling in the characters' compelling backstories. In short, this movie requires - but pays back - patience. Stick with it, and you'll be rewarded with interesting revelations and even some exciting (and surprisingly violent) fight scenes.Due to its unusual blend of action, emotion and social commentary, ""Harakiri"" has shot right up my list of favorite films. I'm tempted to describe it as a Tarantino-style film, only with more of a conscience and a sophisticated worldview. But I suppose that any such comparisons between ""Harakiri"" and American movies must be broad and a little crude. Kobayashi's film stands on its own, of course, and is well worth seeking out for any cinema fan.","

It's easy to jump to conclusions in this movie, but it's like your whole impression of a character changes every 20 minutes. It's unimaginable as to how much controversy this film caused in Japan, especially coming from a Japanese filmmaker, but it really makes you think about the samurai culture and their position in society. It's truly one of the greatest examples of exploring humanism there is. Every character, even the protagonist, have their flaws that probably cost them a lot, but you're not left not understanding any character. You really can see the story from everyone's very different perspectives. It explores ideas that society never really stops to think about, like when is compassion more important than pride, or how literally should you really take things, and when do you really start abusing power. It doesn't force a message or moral on its audience, but just makes you stop to think about them, and show you what can happen when you take one side of it. You can watch this movie looking for every detailed meaning in it, or just watch it because it's a guy with nothing to lose and a lot of skills, going out for justice.

"Harakiri","svikasha","24 June 2017","The concept of ritual suicide in the form of Harakiri, otherwise known as Seppuku, has captivated western imaginations for centuries. Indeed, the very notion of suicide, for religious or social reasons is viewed with a feeling of disdain within the western mindset. However, ritual suicide held an important ceremonial role for members of the Samurai class in ancient Japan. Viewed as an important component of the Samurai's Bushido warrior code, Harakiri was often used as a punishment but was often done voluntarily as well. It was a matter of honor and upheld the tradition of the warrior code. Harakiri forces the audience to confront the brutality of such a tradition and questions the morality of it. During the film, the main character questions both Bushido and the authenticity of the warrior code. He asserts that Bushido is a mere facade rather than a symbol of discipline. Whether or not these assertions are true, is a question that Harakiri leaves for the audience to decide.During the Edo period of the Tokugawa shogunate in Japan, it was common for master less samurai who were known as Ronin to request to commit harakiri in the palace of feudal lords.In this tradition, a man who goes by the name of Tsugumo Hanshirō requests to commit suicide at a powerful feudal lord's courtyard. Masaki Kobayashi directed this film to start out slow with the old man Hanshirō narrating a story. The story is about how the powerful clan at the courtyard was responsible for the death of Hanshirō's entire family. The old man confronts the powerful feudal clan in such a calm and authoritative manner that the audience is left at the edge of their seats. Hanshirō's daughter was married to a poor Samurai that was so destitute that he had to sell his blade to care for his family. He has a young baby who unfortunately gets sick and becomes desperately in need of medicine. When Hanshirō's son in law came to the Li clan seeking alms for medicine, they chose to punish him for disgracefully giving up his Samurai sword by forcing him to disembowel himself in the Seppuku fashion using the only sword he had left: a dull bamboo katana. After covering the dramatic backstory, the movie masterfully builds up to the final conclusion where Hanshirō uses every last ounce of his Samurai abilities to fight his way into the feudal lord's compound to desecrate his hall. The sheer force of will and determination displayed by Hanshirō's character on-screen is a testament to the acting abilities of Tatsuya Nakadai.Despite being shot in black and white, the film is aesthetically appealing as it depicts idyllic Japanese villages and sword fights in Samurai graveyards. At the climax of the film, the greatest line of the film is spoken. Before the culminating final sword battle, the main character proudly proclaims, ""Motome had indeed gone mad. But I say good for him! I praise him for it. He may have been a samurai, but he was a man of flesh and blood. He could not live on air alone. When he has reached the point of no return, even a man as strong as Motome will go mad trying to protect his family, and I would praise him for it. They'll call him the bamboo ronin. Not only samurai, but townspeople, too, will scoff at his wavering. But let them laugh all they want. Who can fathom the depths of another man's heart?"".","

"Harakiri","Pjtaylor-96-138044","3 July 2020","Essentially a condemning statement on the falsity of the samurai's supposed 'code of honour' and the concept of an 'honourable' death, this slow-burning drama sees a man recount his life as he prepares to take it in a ritualistic 'harakiri' ceremony. The tragedy of 'Harakiri (1962)' is profound and, as it moves from one phase to the next, it manages to emotionally affect in some surprising ways. It's a really layered piece, one with a multitude of intertwining themes and hard-won messages. The few sequences of violence it has are suitably brutal and exciting. They're grounded yet stylish, visceral yet thrilling, devastating yet inevitable. Arguably, the movie's most effective moment is an early example of its eponymous act, as a young man is forced to commit 'seppuku' in an incredibly cruel way. This scene is really difficult to sit through, to be honest, and it becomes even worse when the narrative revisits the reasoning behind its circumstances. The film is slow paced but it isn't boring. It's an interesting, entertaining but heavy affair. 7/10","

"Harakiri","bobcatlew","12 June 2000","""Another one? Is there no end?""So the clan elder of the House of Iyi greets the news that Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) is at his gate with an odd request.  Hanshiro, an old, impoverished, unemployed samurai, seeks use of their mansion to perform harakiri, ceremonial suicide that involves self-disembowlment and is an honorable death for a samurai living in disgrace.But in a time of peace, Japan abounds with ex-warriors who threaten to perform this rite only to extort money from weak-willed clans.  In light of such dishonorable conduct, the House of Iyi has adopted stern measures: Any samurai who threatens to perform this rite at their gate will be forced to do so.  Thus a younger ex-warrior, Motome Chigiiwa, met his fate.  Coming with the same request, this unfortunate youth was forced to carry out the rite with a bamboo sword -- ""an unsightly affair.""  The clan elder would warn the older Hanshiro away with the story of Motome's death, but the old warrior is resolved to die.Things, however, are not what they seem.  Hanshiro seems to have more on his mind than suicide.  And, as he relates his own lifestory to the warriors of Iyi clan, not only are their stern measures called into question, but also the very honor of which they are so proud.Seppuku is an awesome story of revenge told with devastating effect.  By the time you know what the story is really about, you yourself have cast judgement on the characters.  Then things turn on you, and nothing appears as it did before.  In this film a tragic story, great sword duels, haunting atmospheric music, and an exciting final battle combine to form what I think is an overlooked masterpiece.  Director Masaki Kobayashi does to the samurai genre what Sam Pekinpah will later do to the western in The Wild Bunch:  He takes the samurai code and turns it upon its head.  This film is great, and worth every repeated watching.","

"Harakiri","KaceyLeggio","18 June 2014","While ""Harakiri"" was not my first experience with Japanese history, culture or cinema, it was still an impacting and enlightening film. While ruthless in nature, ""Harakiri"" does a wonderful job in conveying the history of ancient Japan, samurais and the Bushido code. While some people's knowledge of samurais only extend as far as the Disney film, ""Mulan"", ""Harakiri"" sheds a great deal of light on the underlying meaning behind the truth, strength and honor of the code. With a protagonist that is both relentless and appealing, ""Harakiri"" delivers special performances all over the board. While it moves a bit slow, there is an undeniable enchantment about this film. The story, while heart-wrenching, is so well done that you come out of it rooting for more. It makes you question history and the way it's perceived, just as I'm sure Mr. Kobayashi intended. With engaging choreography and near-perfect consume and set design, ""Harakiri"" brings you to a place and time that you otherwise may not have known existed. Kobayashi does a wonderful job at conveying the internal struggle between all characters, men whom have an obligation to their families, and those who have one to their code. This film challenges all the elements of revenge, redefinition and ritual. A job very well done.","

A simple tale told by a kneeling man climbs step-by-step from a mystery to an historical metaphor for political lying and cover-ups, with every step along the way a chance for astonishing photography and heart-racing action.

"Harakiri","bladefd","10 January 2024","Harakiri (1962) is a Japanese film that takes place in 1630, and it is a story of the Samurai code of honor and family. Harakiri (also called seppuku) is the ritualistic suicide once employed by Samurai warriors to die while keeping their honor intact. A Samurai, Hanshiro Tsugumo, travels to the House of a rival clan Iyi, asking for a place to commit seppuku. Clans would permit such requests because it was an honorable final act for a Samurai to save his honor in their house. At that time, Samurai often arrived under a false pretense of committing seppuku but leaving with gold. The clan believes Tsugumo arrived under such false pretense. The story unravels from that point into a flashback of another Samurai, Motome Chijiiwa, who had arrived under such false pretense. I can't say anything more about the relationship between Tsugumo and Chijiiwa without spoiling the story.The filming style is interesting. It is depicted using dialogue and several flashbacks as it draws out the plot. The first hour is slow-paced, but the story picks up pace thereafter. It is ultimately a pushback on the Samurai code and the hypocrisy behind it.Would I recommend this? Yes, I believe it was very well done. The directing often reminded me of Akira Kurosawa's works. I would think the director of this film was inspired by Kurosawa. However, it's probably not for everyone because of the pacing, style, and lack of much action (until the last half hour). Not everyone likes subtitles either.","

The story that was intended to scare away Hanshiro only carried him to tell a story of his own and so he did in the oddest fashion. And through flashbacks we learn it and the more we know the more we understand.. the more we feel.. the more we think.Harakiri (1962), that its events are set out between 1619 and 1630 of the Edo period, is a perfect study of the human mind, heart, and soul. It is also a study of the human relations and that of the society and individual..Through its characters and their contradicting personalities you will learn a lot.. Sincerity and hypocrisy, faith and appearances, love and hate, caring and indifference, courage and fear... The social structure: flaws and corruptness.. The society's symbols and traditions: their depth and when they are only a cover. And then there is history: how it happens and then how it is written. This is all one thing about Harakiri and the other aspects that make a film are just as perfect.. the cinematography, soundtrack, acting.. every single aspect.. and the duels we see reminded me of the duels in ""The good, the bad, and the ugly', only that here it's with swords.Truly the film is a masterpiece.. a journey that you should undergo.","

"Harakiri","TheUnholyPeanut","31 March 2023","Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" is a seminal masterpiece of Japanese cinema, a film that examines the complex relationship between honor, tradition, and power in feudal Japan. Released in 1962, the film remains a timeless and thought-provoking exploration of the human condition.At its core, ""Harakiri"" is a film about the futility of the cycle violence and the destructive power of revenge. The film's protagonist, Hanshiro Tsugumo, arrives at the doorstep of a powerful samurai clan, seeking permission to commit ritual suicide (harakiri) on their grounds. But as he tells the story of a former samurai who was forced to commit suicide under similar circumstances, it becomes clear that his request is more than just a simple act of honor, and this unravels into a heartbreaking, tragic tale.The film's exploration of the samurai code and the role of honor in Japanese society is both complex and nuanced. Through its portrayal of the rituals and customs surrounding harakiri, ""Harakiri"" examines the ways in which tradition can be used to justify violence and oppression.The script and dialogue of ""Harakiri"" are sharp and incisive, with each word carefully chosen to convey the complex emotions and motivations of the characters. The film's characters are richly drawn and fully realized, with each one possessing their own distinct personality and backstory. It is a character study of a man's raging, internal conflict, not an action-packed samurai flick like you might expect, but it is just as thrilling and even more provocative.The cinematography and directing of ""Harakiri"" are nothing short of masterful. The film's use of wide shots and close-ups is particularly effective in conveying the emotional and psychological states of the characters. The contrast between the opulent surroundings of the samurai clan and the desolate, poverty-stricken world outside serves as a powerful metaphor for the social and economic divides of feudal Japan.The acting in ""Harakiri"" is uniformly excellent, with each actor delivering a nuanced and powerful performance. Tatsuya Nakadai, in particular, delivers a standout performance as the film's protagonist, Hanshiro Tsugumo, bringing depth and complexity to a character struggling with the weight of tradition and the desire for revenge, which is a complex and tragic conflict. The rest of the cast also gives excellent performances as well, bringing depth to the characters and script. I particularly enjoyed Tetsuo Tamba's performance as well.The film is incredibly deep, it's themes provocative and powerful. For one, ""Harakiri"" can be seen as a critique of feudalism and the ways in which the ruling class uses tradition to justify their power and privilege. The contrast between the beautiful architecture of the Samurai Clan to the squalor and sheer misery of the peasants highlights this in Feudal Japan. Kobayashi also uses Feudal Japan to critique Post-WW2 Japan in a variety of ways, including how tradition can be used for violence and hatred, something incredibly relevant at this time. We see Tsugumo challenge tradition and the status quo in many ways throughout the film, which culminates in a bloody finale.Ultimately, ""Harakiri"" is a powerful and thought-provoking cinematic experience, a film that challenges the viewer to question their own beliefs about honor, tradition, and power. Its exploration of the samurai code and the rituals surrounding harakiri is both complex and nuanced, and its characters are richly drawn and fully realized. Masaki Kobayashi's masterful direction, combined with outstanding performances from the film's cast, make ""Harakiri"" a timeless masterpiece of Japanese cinema.","

"Harakiri","jamesrupert2014","24 September 2016","Harakiri tells the story of vengeance with a minimum of action (but a surprising amount of blood for a early '60s film). The flashback based story is well told, Tatsuya Nakadai is excellent as the down-and-out samurai slowly unravelling his tale, and the black and white film is beautiful to watch, especially the last showdown. The Samurai film genre lends itself to comparison to the American ""western"" and, with its emphasis on the plight of the destitute ronin, Harakiri could be likened to the early revisionist oaters. Highly recommended, especially before or after a viewing of one of the Japanese versions of ""47 Ronin"" (personally, I like the lengthy, understated 1941 version).","

There is no point writing anything about the plot, actually two reviews (including IMDb's one) I read afterward reveal too much of it. I think the director would like to create a progressive change to the viewer's attitude concerning ""honor"" and ""moral"". Being Black&White and almost theatrical, it leads you to think rather than watch enchanted by the picture. It is not really a samurai action film, neither a film like ""Hero"" or ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (both of which I liked so much, for different reasons), although some scenes have common elements. I know not everybody will like it, it is a bit slow and also cruel but it has a point for both. The picture was a little blur at times, but I don't know if it was the film's or the cinema's fault. Anyway, it's a 42-year-old film, so that's better than we can expect!During the intermission,I was wondering which century I live in, so much was I incorporated in the atmosphere! PS.

The movie is pretty boring in the beginning, but it soon evolves into a masterpiece, but it isn`t as good as ""The 7 Samurai"". ""Harakiri"" is a way for a Samurai to commit suicide in an honorable way, so it isn`t difficult to understand that the movie will be about Japanese warriors killing themselves with their sword. It is a movie that captures the atmosphere of Japan in the 1700`s and the sword-fights are magnificent.

2) The cultural and era often make no sense (in contemporary American terms)
3) They take the traditions and bushido code far too seriously
4) They're absurdly brutish masculine, almost like animalsThis film takes a different approach in that 90% of the film is story-telling, and the sword play is almost ancillary. It's a nice change, but ultimately boring.STORY: If you've watched Japanese (samurai) film then the story is old. It's as simple as vengeance sought for some injustice, which isn't a bad thing. But after awhile, this becomes boring, if not useless. There is ZERO CHARACTER development here, which seems inconsistent with the (seeming) intent of the director. But I felt almost nothing for the characters, or their travail.ACTING: Again, as to Japanese samurai film, it's fine. But there's NO acting that stands up, let alone out. Just dull, flat, mechanical. Aside from the perfunctory grunting, the dialogue is predictable.TEMPO: Very, very, very slow. Not atypical for the sub-genre, but brutally slow.CINEMATOGRAPHY: The scenery is lack-luster, but at least tidy. Props are OK, but sparse. Sound is OK, but nothing interesting.DIRECTING: This same director churns this stuff out on script and cue. For the sub-genre fine, but doubt there's much transferable skill to other film genre.Overall, a slow-moving, run-of-the-mill samurai film. Dull. Pointless.","

In this outstanding film, it is the struggles of the poor that are the prime focus, and the way in which they continue to maintain their honor and pride as they are forced to take menial tasks or watch their loved ones die due to lack of money.It is also timely as the poor we are talking about were the former Samurai who were forced into poverty as their jobs were eliminated by the Shogunate.These newly poor then, as now, are demonized as unworthy, ignoring the fact that it was society that made them poor, and society that made them unable to retain other work except for the most menial tasks. They were often reduced to begging, and that is how the story opens.The story is not what is seems at first as we soon find there is much more than we first imagined.Make no mistake, it includes some great action that one expects to see in a Samurai film, but that is not as important as Shinobu Hashimoto's dialog. It was captivating.The film is an indictment of the class system and it's so-called ""honor."" It also shows the mentality that lead to World War II. It is a film that will captivate you and anger you.The acting is superb, the score amazingly good, and the black and white cinematography first rate.Tatsuya Nakadai (Ran, Yojimbo) was outstanding in the lead role, and Masaki Kobayashi's direction ranks him among the best in Japan.","

Although this is a period movie from 1630, the universality of the theme can never be missed. This questions the present days' idea of honour that is expected from the soldiers and civilians alike and unfaltering loyalty towards the codes of conduct that bind them together. This movie challenges this very idea.The cinematography, set design, actings, musical scores are excellent. But these aspects do not make this movie special.

The prudent pace the story moves in is in itself the depiction of the samurai society: the extreme respect, the omnipresent rituals of courtesy, the will to listen to your foes, the patience.The key in the greatness of this film -my favourite samurai film, personally- lies in the meticulous (negative reviewers would have to say here: ""painstaking"") representation of the relationships between these people who live for and by an immutable code of honor,and how the story ends up telling us that, in the end -for better or for worse- man is above any social principle or code. Hanshiro Tsumogo (the main character) is, after all, only demanding an apology for the way the young Motome Chijiiwa was treated, but we see how arrogance stands in the way of the samurai code, and he's left empty-handed.On the other side of the coin, Motome Chijiiwa's act of love for his wife and son, which involves his total humiliation, again defies the samurai code.""After all, this thing we call samurai honor is ultimately nothing but a facade."" says Hanshiro Tsugumo after recounting his story.

Despite this warning a poor ronin insists that he has never heard that story and says that he has no intention of leaving their palace alive. After a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, the ronin is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. Coincidentally, he has chose three samurai who have participated in the ritual of the unfortunate young ronin from the counselor's story. However, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness.

At least that was how it occurred in my case. Although slow at first, this film picks up momentum and easily enthralls the viewer with a magnificent showcase of storytelling. Of all the films I've seen in my International Cinema class this has to be my favorite, just a top notch film all the way around.","

Harakiri is thematically brilliant, exuding tremendous emotion that leaves one staggered come end credits. I would love to say why, but it would only ruin the experience. Kobayashi had guts to deliver the sociopolitical stalemates he made within this film and I have deep respect for him having done it. Of course there is more to this film besides its commentary. Its shots and cinematography are gorgeous in every sense of the way and the acting is superb. Most importantly it's narration and story is seamless while its climactic rise is one of the best I've experienced from any film. I don't just hand out perfect ratings, but a masterpiece such as this film deserves it.","

Samurai have been abandoned by their lords and left to eke out a meagre living on their own. One of these penniless ronin samurai asks for assistance at a samurai house that remains rich in the martial tradition.In this tale, the plot lead me towards one conclusion, before gradually but steadily send me in the other direction. This masterful misdirection only makes the film's violent and vengeful conclusion all the more spectacular. I will never again view samurai honor culture in the same light.","

It shows whatever the traditions are good or bad but family is the most important thing in life.It shows some traditions managed by bad leaders can come to very bad endings.I would recommend this movie for everyone and am sure u will like this classic samurai flick.","

"Harakiri","ragingbull_2005","10 May 2020","Technically brilliant, narrative wise unpredictable, superbly acted, Harakiri (Japanese) is rightly considered as one of the best films of all time, across all languages.The setup is so tantalizing. A samurai turns up at a grand lord's home, searching for a place to commit suicide. The counselor at the grand lord's place tells him of another samurai who had come a month back with the same request and that sets the ball rolling.If this movie were in Technicolor and I were to not tell you the year in which it was released, it would be difficult for general audience to guess the year/decade of its release as there is not much, if anything, that seems dated.The one drawback for me was one of the sword fighting scenes that lacks the intensity of modern action sequences. However, it more than makes up for it by the time it ends.Very highly recommended. You would be enthralled by its direction and it's narrative trajectory. Truly one of the greatest of all time","

"Harakiri","diego1235467","7 June 2011","This is a fantastic film that questions what honor truly means, and what it meant for the Samurai. It presents us with a rich and thrilling story that has us glued to our seats as we follow different Samurai through an unwinding mystery surrounding the death of a young Ronin.The film gives us a glimpse into the less than ideal lives of the Samurai, and shows us the truly human issues that they had to deal with, like family and loss, instead of simply showing battle scenes. The film is about the priorities that a man has to set for himself, and the conflicting values between the Bushido code, and the family life of a samurai.Through it's form of story structure, the film also teaches us to never judge a book by its cover, by changing who we perceived to be the protagonist originally. This structure, on top of the heavy issues that the film deals with, makes it an truly unforgettable journey.","

"Harakiri","djtaylor114","7 June 2011","Masaki Kobayashi's Hara-Kiri is a great example of an all-around, expertly-crafted film. What is surprising is that this film is not as well-known as some of the other Japanese films from the golden age of Japanese cinema. Without a doubt, this film should stand high with the rest of them. The film seems to begin with a standard samurai story, but it soon branches off into a much more intricate and intriguing story dealing with love, suicide, dishonor, and revenge. One of the things that strikes me as particularly impressive about this film is the cinematography, which definitely seems ahead of its time. There is a lot of focus on the moving camera, and some of the shots flow so smoothly and capture the action in such artistically-stimulating ways that at times it is hard to believe this film was created in 1962. Some particularly modern shots are the ones during the opening credits where the camera dollies ever-so-slightly down tight hallways. The opening and closing to the film are of the same shot of samurai armor against a black background, and there is something artistically brilliant about this; beginning and ending a movie with the same shot seems to perfectly wrap things up and give a transcendental meaning to the content of the film contained between the two identical shots. In addition to the staging of the camera, the high-contrast blacks and whites make every shot in the film beautiful to look at.The story in Hara-Kiri is very emotional and can resonate even with modern-day Westerners that have little to no understanding of Samurai culture. One of the main themes, which revolves around the timelessness and importance of love and family, particularly had an effect on me, and drew me into the emotions of Hanshiro, the protagonist of the story. Overall, Hara-Kiri is a film that everyone should see. It is because of films like this that I have such an interest in filmmaking; there is no end to the inspiration that can come from such films that touch on the deepest questions of life and reach down into our innermost primal emotions.","

"Harakiri","Jhenchree","2 June 2011","""Harakiri"", made by Masaki Kobayashi in 1962, is a tale of a former samurai, or ronin named Hanshiro's struggle to make sense of his son-in-laws unnecessary death, get revenge, all while essentially exploiting the corruption within the daimyo Iyi's manor. Kobayashi appeal to the audience is to reveal some truth behind and otherwise glorified samurai lifestyle. He tries to show the although a samurai's word is his bond and they follow a certain code, when that code or bond is broken for your own benefit, things typically collapse. This transforms to an system with a strict code governing its members, but is especially prevalent in the Japanese culture. Set during the Tokugawa Era, Kobayashi wants people to recognize that human life if much more important than any ""Bushido Code"" for samurais. Cinematographically, Kobayashi utilizes many black-and-whites, in a harsh landscape almost stylized like a painting. Emotionally, I really felt for Motome, Hanshiro, and his daughter and their struggle just to get by. Motome's fatal attempt to join the Iyi daimyo and his body's return to Hanshiro's are heart-wrenching moments that seem impossible to believe are actually carried out.","

"Harakiri","Airyoni33","6 June 2011","Hello there, Yoni again. So my second film for review is from Hara-kiri. A1962 film, directed by Masaki Kobayashi. This film begins a bit slowly and has those moments throughout the film and started off with a lot of dialog. This plays off the idea of having morals and honor. Some of the film it was a bit rough for me to identify certain parts of what was going on and the whole concept during the film but this is what I came up with.From what I took from it was Hanshiro Tsugumo enters the house of lords of another character named Kageyu Saito. Tsugumo wanted to commit in a form of Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment (Hara-kiri). This act was only reserved for samurais only. While getting ready for his suicide, Hanshiro goes over his time with Saito and the retainers. Hanshiros lord's house was thought out to be a threat and surrounded by toppled by forces. One of Hanshiro's friends committed the same ritual (Hara-kiri) which caused Hansiro to watch after his son. Towards the end of the film Hanshiro tracks down three of the retainers of the lord's house and blames them for the deaths of his family. But, instead of killing the retainers in a battle he disgraces them by cutting off the topknots of their heads which is far worst then death.At the end of the film, Hanshiro is attacked by all of the retainers and must fight all of them. More retainers arrive after Hanshiro fights all the retainers. This is when Hanshiro decides his time is over and commits hara-kiri to die as a samurai with honor.In this film you could really feel the power of how much honor meant to these samurai's. It was all they cared about and nothing else mattered. These films shows the ""new"" turning point in the 17th century between samurai's that fought with swords and the new military that began to use guns. This film represents retaining a person's honor after disgrace","

"Harakiri","grendel-37","10 January 2005","Just saw this film thanks in part to comments left on this site, avoiding the spoilers of course. Just wanted to give my take on the film, and some of the reviews on the film.First if you haven't seen the film, simply put it's not just worth seeing, it's worth buying. It is a well performed, brilliantly photographed, hauntingly scored, and masterfully directed film.That said it's often spoken of in the same breath as SWORD OF DOOM, and that is highly misleading. If you go in expecting the visceral, brilliantly choreographed sword fights and unrelenting action of that film, you will not find it here.This is very much a drama, a morality tale of a time and a place; an exploration and an indictment of a way of life, and as such it has very few equals. The movie does lag, it is in many ways a monologue, one man talking more to himself than anyone else, of the ending of his life.But an enthralling story, captivating visuals, and above all else, one of the most intriguing and effective soundscapes since the great Dimitri Tiomkin's work on 1950s DOA, keeps this static film... moving and engrossing.Mentioning DOA, leads me to the bashing Hollywood takes regularly here from ""critics"" such as Landor28. Critics who in their rush to praise films, do it by backhanding other films. I'm not a critic, I'm just a reviewer. Critic implies you have some from the mountaintop perspective that gives you the right to criticize. Unless you've made movies, superior to what you're reviewing, you don't get to criticize. Review yes, criticize... no.Has Hollywood made bad films? Yes Hollywood makes its share of bad films, so does Japan, so does India, so does Hong Kong, so does every other country that makes movies. However Hollywood makes the most films, the most visible films, and the largest films, so it is an easy lump-sum target as opposed to taking each film on its own merits. Hollywood in fact is judged harsher by these critics, held to a higher standard than films from elsewhere in the world.I am no defender of Hollywood, as I don't work there, and not fortunate to know anyone who does, but I am a film fan, and a fan of the truth, and to praise films by Kurosawa and Kobayashi and to denigrate the films of Hollywood is to make a mistake these directors did not. These men, like all postwar filmmakers, were inspired by the films of Hollywood, particularly present in the work of all these directors is the large and brilliant work of John Ford.Kurosawa would be the first to state this. Fords widescreen westerns are at the heart of the cinematic recreation of the Samurai. The samurai world as envisioned by Kurosawa as much about history as it is the heroic imagery of the western. They are Stagecoach and Searchers transplanted to the east.A simplification to be sure, but not much of one. Postwar cinema in Japan and throughout the world copied from the states, and that's a good thing. And has started a trend that continues to this day of films successful in one country being copied in another. And we are the better for this two way copying. That's what film is people, copying.Copying a headline, or a book, or a play, or another film, copying a moment and making it your own. That's what all art is, looking at something, copying something, a sunset, a tree, a woman, a birds cry, and adding your own... bleeding to it. That's all life is, being influenced by something people have bled on, and if we are great men, leaving our own blood on it... to influence others.Only those with no art in their souls, don't see this. Only the very young, or the very stupid. Landor28 accuses Scorscese of stealing from Seppuku, an inane comment to make.How many shots in Seppuku but reecho earlier brilliant compositions of Stroheim. But I don't hear you calling Kobayashi a thief. And rightly so, no one owns a shot. Cinema, and images belongs to the story that can tell it. And if that image or look, can service well a thousand films, than it should be used a thousand times. What is film noir, but the same type of look, and camera angles used repeatedly. But used from the directors own viewpoint, it becomes the director's tale. So the comment of theft shows someone ignorant of the fact that there is nothing new under the sun, there are just 7 stories and 5 angles; and all cinema since.... but each person retelling this story through the lens of their own joy or pain.And if they are honest, the story each time... is worth hearing.Give these directors, whether they work in India, or New Zealand or Kenya or Hollywood their due. Shymalan is a great director, Weir is a great director, Fincher is a great director, Carl Frankin is a great director, Lee is a great director, Zimmerman is a great director, Gibson (for Braveheart not Passion), Ron Howard is a great director, Edward Zwick is a great Director (his resume since 89 reads like a bloody history lesson of great films.) and they all work in Hollywood, and their work inspires all kinds of foreign flicks you do rave about.Get off of Hollywood's back, it's always popular to hate the top dog, but it's also sometimes unwarranted.SEPPUKU is a great film, by a master director. ***1/2 out of ****. If you like it also check out these films: GLORY (1989 Ed Zwick), COURAGE UNDER FIRE, A HERO NEVER DIES, KING OF NEW YORK, LE SAMOURAI, SWORD OF DOOM, BACKDRAFT, Excalibur, TUAREG, MENACE II SOCIETY.They are all films about, to one degree or another, displaced honor and cannibal societies.","

"Harakiri","igotasecret","6 June 2011","Now I may be biased about this movie over others due to the fact that I love watching Japanese cinema, but Harakiri was a well crafted and brilliantly well thought out movie made by Masaki Kobayashi. All the actors and actresses acted well on their individual roles. I enjoyed watching and learning the ways of the Samurai Culture. The Samurai Culture was all about obedience, honor and respect. However, one may question whether or not these samurai codes were too strict during these times. The way the film demonstrates Hara-Kiri in a well mannered and carefully crafted method in which does not disturb the viewers to the point where they would call it sickening or disturbing. I could it simply call it a beautiful, yet deadly ritual to acknowledge. The story, itself, is also very well made. There have been quite a few Japanese movies that have tried to implement a story in their rather interesting (quirky) plots, but fail to capitalize by making the film much more confusing. Most Japanese films these days also try to make their movies more vague and make their audience question the characters actions and story plot lines. However, this movie is straight forward and to the point. I really like this film and the way it was constructed. It gave me more insight of the life of the samurai. Even though it doesn't come close to my favorites Japanese movies such as Departures, Battle Royale, Spirited Away or Confessions, it does the subject of Harakiri justice where it fully explains the way of the samurai code well.","

This movie was another good example that simple composition and slow movement of the camera can have bigger impact than ""nowadays"" extremely busy, and showy cinematography. I like the fact that the film is black and white (1962). A strong contrast, really dark blacks and really bright whites, makes it visually really strong... which I think emphasizes the story, where we have this ""right and wrong"" (""black and white"") samurai honor code. I think that this movie is very universal in a sense of introduced cultural aspects and asked questions, which can be seen more general. What is more important: the life of their own families or following the rules to save their honor? Finally, what is the greater disgrace to the samurai, ""bend the neck"" and humiliate the time of the request, to commit suicide with hunger, or to lose hair-tip of samurai. The answer to these questions, in a context of the Japanese tradition, can not be easily answered... but I think we can ask ourself how strong are we impacted by cultural or social rules... and going further to realize that part of those who should protect the values and follow the rules, are the one who break them. There is one scene in the move I could not watch, hara-kiri with bamboo sword. It was really realistically shot- long take with a close-up. Even it was back and white and the blood did not look ""real"", I was really disturbed, but In the same time I think this scene was necessary to emphasize brutality and nonsense of hara-kiri. After watching final scene in this movie I have no doubt that Quentin Tarrantino, before he shoot ""Kill Bill"", has watched big masters of Japaniese cinema...","

"Harakiri","Maxence_G","31 July 2020","This movie came has an enormous surprise to me, while I anticipated an action-packed chanbara film, its plot is a tragedy, and his thematics are extremely relevant.In Seppuku, the authoritarian government takes the form of the feudal system. Kobayashi was certainly one of the most engaged directors on this topic.His genius is to transpose modern japan in the chanbara style using poetry and well-tough metaphors as well as an extremely engaging a universal narrative. Each character is motivation/emotion/aspiration can be defined by a simple glance at the characters' eyes, at a certain point, I noticed that the subtitles weren't necessary (and I don't speak a word of Japanese). This demonstrates how powerful the directing and the acting of the cast, and especially Tatsuya Nakadai are in this movie. I'm not even talking about the role that lighting an color grading had in this movie because they merit their own analysis!Sincerely, while this movie is indeed not the most action-packed jidaigeki film out there.

Yes, there are fantastic movies and then there's great movies.This is the only movie I have given a 10 rating, quite simply because it is pure excellence in which every scene is captivating and multi-layered in its emotional depth. Set in the 1600's in feudal Japan, it is a story of happiness turned desperation, leading ultimately to the cataclysmic act of ultimate revenge.The beauty of Hara-Kiri is how the story is told, as if you the viewer, are a witness to the unfortunate events presented.

"Harakiri","kurosawakira","15 January 2013","My favourite Kobayashi, and among my favourite Japanese films of all time, ""Harakiri"" (known in Japan as ""Seppuku""; the former is a spoken term, the latter a written one for the same thing, the former likely adopted in the West on the basis of some general awareness of the word) is a masterly exploration of space, symmetry, honour, disloyalty, tradition, modernity and truth.This film has one of the most amazing opening sequences ever. It goes beyond the best of Greenaway or Tarkovsky in how the camera moves and reveals a space, and I'd like to know whether Zhang Yimou considers this an influence on the similarly masterly ""Raise the Red Lantern"" (Da hong deng long gao gao gua, 1991). Especially the framing in the exterior shots is just as beautifully conveyed. Anyway, back to the sequence – there we are introduced to the idea of the ""house"": not only in the sense of ""assembly"" but also as a building. The main visual motif of the film (the courtyard scenes are another) is very theatrically revealed in shadow and light, and even before the narrative begins (we enter a book read to us, which again, appropriately, is not the whole truth).I am so in love with how the film looks and how the camera moves. Symmetries open, are revealed, tighten. There are amazingly patient tracking shots, especially in the interiors, where the camera sometimes barely moves at all.The performances are just as amazing as the rest of the craft. In fact, this film brings together two absolute icons. For me, Tatsuya Nakadai is the quintessential Japanese actor, even greater than Mifune. His presence is overwhelming, just as his humanity. His eyes speak more than a thousand words in mere glances. Rentarô Mikuni is another, and his work in Ichikawa's ""The Burmese Harp"" (Biruma no tategoto, 1956) and in Imamura's films (most notably in ""The Profound Desires of the Gods"" [1968] and ""Vengeance is Mine"" [1979]) adds tremendously to my viewing experience. There are two very good Blu-ray editions available for this, released by the Criterion Collection (Region A) and the Masters of Cinema series (Region B). The Criterion appears to be cropped on the sides to a surprisingly noticeable degree, however.","

"Harakiri","anastasiiapodrez","16 June 2014","This is a very ambiguous movie. One commits seppuku whether his lord asks him to or he commits it because of the loss of faith. This story is about a ronin, basically an unemployed samurai. The protagonist in ""Harakiri"", Hanshiro, portrayed by Tatsuya Makadai, is the only one in the whole movie who actually follows the samurai code, and at the end he is killed by it. Violence takes place in the film as well, so make sure you are mentally prepared to watch people disemboweling themselves with bamboo swords. I enjoyed the emotional cut of the movie and instant shots which really reflect characters' despair and happy flashbacks from their past. Interesting choices were made by the director, Masaki Kobayashi, who has always been interested in the anti-establishment of the world, samurai culture in particular. Everything becomes really tragic when Hanshiro's friend performs seppuku, or when his daughter and grandson die Meanwhile, Hanshiro blindly follows the samurai's code and falls into dogmatism. He assumes seppuku is something true and follows the rules no matter what. Some scenes may seem funny for a contemporary viewer; Kobayashi was trying to add a little humor. Tragedy, politics, drama, and comedy The film has it all. I would recommend watching this film to those who are stricken by Japanese samurai movies.","

"Harakiri","jay4stein79-1","1 April 2006","Kobayashi is one of the unsung heroes of Japanese cinema. Ozu and Kurosawa get all the ink, and they do so undeservedly to my mind. Kobayashi, Shinoda, and Mizoguchi do get respect, but their skill and artistry should elevate them above Kurosawa if not Ozu as well. Harakiri is, probably, my favorite samurai film, which, I think, derives from its willingness to talk and explore the concept of the samurai and the code of honor by which they abide. Harakiri seems, to me, to work on a number of levels, while most of Kurosawa's films operate on the most basic one. Rashomon digs deeper, but the rest seem content to exist as fun little action movies with great vistas. Harakiri is different. The setting also helps. The compound in which the action takes place is one of the most amazing sets I've encountered in any film. It seems magical to me, and the cinematography of the interiors is astounding. Like most people, I'm usually more struck by gorgeous photography of open land; interiors are harder to film in interesting ways. Harakiri manages to make the inside of the compound spare and, occasionally, unreal. It's magnificent. Overall, I think this film is immensely enjoyable and will appeal to anyone with an appreciation of Japanese cinema--especially those that would typically avoid a samurai movie.","

Of course fight scenes are not as much brutal as we would see in Kill- Bill or other movies where people use swords, but the fact that in this movie they used real swords its frightening.The main point of the main character to come and cut his belly is not just because of situation of his life but also to give honor for those who passed away before and also to point out the problem of dogmatic point of view of high ranked people which actually pointing some interesting thoughts about life in Japan at period of time when movie was made.If amazing cinematography and issues that viable today are not enough to make you watch this movie than just watch it to know what is it ""To be Ronin"" or who are samurais and what was the time of samurais when Japan was extremely distant. I'm not saying that this movie tell the truth about Japan before 1615 but at least it give you a very interesting option of how it could be.Might warn you that movie is pretty long and mostly based on dialogs and flash-backs so if you want sword massacre then watch Kill Bill.","

This is a movie with a serious theme means through this old, black and white movie, people can get to know the Japanese samurai history in the specific time period(1619-1630). This movie also can be considered as a historic documentary.According to the plot, it was pretty simple— a déclassé samurai whose daughter and grandchild were sick, the son in law had to go to Kageyu Saito's house to beg for some money by choosing harakiri in front of Saito's house. But Saito did not want to know the reason that forced son in law seppuku by using a bamboo katana. Then the samurai fought back, criticized ruthless rulers and exposed their hypocrisy. As a result, the authorities got angry, and the samurai was too weak to fought the group of the authority's followers, and end up with tragic death. In the end, the matter was covered up by the authority, and no one knows. In Masaki Kobayashi's movie ""Harakiri"", it contained two strictly parallel corresponding stories. From the structure, these two stories were divided into serval parts, and were orderly placed into the plot according to the rhythm and the progress of the story in order to create a rigorous form so that the movie would have a significant theatrical feature.For people, it is natural to love, to be loved, and to survive. There would no reason for people to questioning their love for their family, and sometimes, people would do anything to protect their family just like what Chijima Motome did, and it is hard for someone to despicable or judge him. Also, the true warrior is even though there is hopeless situation can still remain calm, and stick to their principles and dignity.","

"Harakiri","Hitchcoc","13 February 2024","A stumbling block for a Westerner is that we are dealing with the Japanese world of the 1600's where Samurai were once the enforcers but were then no longer needed and cast aside. They became beggars and men without hope. There was no work for them. Some then turned to a the realities of the Samurai code. This was Harakiri, which is the ritual disemboweling of the self with a sword in front of a group of clan members. Making things more complicated is that some of those leaders stepped in and provided charity for these men, leading to a wave of them seeking money. But in this one, a young man whose real story we don't know till the end, presents himself for self execution and then wants to go away for a while. He is kept there and eventually, using a bamboo sword, takes his life. But the big story is a man, connected to this young man, who also presents himself, and he tells a tale that is so sad. This is where conventions trump the sad realities of the people. Duty is seen ahead of compassion. Also, there is definitely politics and self interest at work. While this take a great deal of commitment to watch, don't miss it. Outstanding.","

Harakiri can be a history of documentary , because it reflects the samurai decline; it also can combine with the background and reality in Japan in 1962, think of it is a criticism and political film, also can look it in a moral view, concluded that despicability is the passport for the despicable. But I think the film just want to express---to live, to love. The most important thing to do is to live, can you despicable Chijiwa Motome? He just wants to get money to save his wife and son, Harakiri is the worst way to get money, but he still to do that. People have no reason to love and to life, it is necessary to love and to be loved, do not need any reason. I f you love someone, you still to find the reason you love him or her, your love is already crumbling, do you like this ramshackle life? So I really respect Chijiwa and Tsugumo, they love their family with no reason. The film is very political and depressive, their love is the only warming and touching point.","

Kobayashi decided to tell the story in a non-linear style with plenty of flashbacks. This allowed the viewer to remain on edge, filled with skepticism and anticipation throughout the film. This director has no limits. I don't think I have ever had such a reaction to blood and gore in a film as I did in Harakiri. It got me to my feet. I completely respect his decision to show those elements, as they were completely necessary. This choice commanded that the viewer recognize from the very beginning that this was not just a story of life and death but a tale with deeper meaning. Isolationism was the overall theme of this movie, and Kobayashi does a spectacular job of sticking to this. Whenever we see Hanshiro telling his story from the courtyard we are overwhelmed with this sense of isolation, an every man for himself type of feeling.Cinematically speaking, the choices made in this arena felt ironically inviting and apprehensive simultaneously. Kobayashi makes the choice to shoot the majority of the film at kneeling height or eye level, because that is where the majority of people remained throughout the entire film. It is really one of those films that leaves you questioning, which makes sense as the director was prominently known for questioning all things Japanese.","

The stunning and crisp black and white cinema from the director Masaki Kobayashi showcases the theme of the film and of the samurai with the discipline and orderliness displayed throughout the film. However, there is much more behind the curtain of the so-called samurai. Tsugumo Hanshirō, the hero, or maybe even consider an anti-hero, has a mission to commit harakiri because he has become a shogun and would like an honorable death. The mission at hand isn't really the one the audience or Iyi Clan thought it to be. With a brilliant story and a wonderful battle of Hanshiro and the clan at the end, this movie brings thought provoking elements and a surprising plot twist that will give any more than they expected.","

"Harakiri","Mnemosyne15","17 March 2020","There is a law in human society. No matter what, if it exists for a long time, it will slowly deteriorate, decay, and rigid. As soon as the heyday of the Taiping arrived, there was no need to fight anymore, and Bushido gradually became empty furnishings and forms. Young warriors have hardly ever seen war, and warriors have only become a symbol of identity and status. Like the armor of the ancestor worshipped on the altar, it will not be used for a long time, and it has lost its original meaning and has become a meaningless worship. Bushido, like feudal autocracy, is rigid, degenerate, and decaying. The big name is to maintain the dignity of Bushido, in fact, to maintain the identity and pomp of his nobility.
The film illustrates the decline and deterioration of this Bushido from three different directions.
To the beggar, he was a young warrior, and he also lacked a deep understanding of these tedious warrior temperaments and spirits. However, he is also a simple man, a law-abiding person. However, in the face of the burden of the family, he had to let go of this spiritual pursuit, facing the cruel reality, and sold his sabre with pain. A man who has abandoned all dignity for his wife and children is miserable and bears humiliation. For him, Bushido is just a spiritual obsession, a distant cold spiritual pursuit. He couldn't reach it, so, like a deadly law, he was finally abandoned in the presence of a warm and tangible family. However, the most tragic thing is that this man who was deprived of his dignity and spirit was ultimately killed in his injustice.","

It takes place in a time where thousand of Samurai where out of work and thrown into poverty. It was very interesting to see another cultures perspective on honor and loyalty. I felt bad for the ronins that where poor and had no way to survive. Harakiri is a ritualistic suicide for Samurai in Ancient Japan. This is an honorable ritual. The film tends to jumps around in different points of view throughout the storyline, so make sure you pay attention. What I took away from this movie is that sometimes the traditional ways of respecting authority must be questioned, especially when it comes down to what you believe to be right or wrong.","

I admire Mizoguchi for going against his cultures beliefs in order to showcase his own for others. So often we are quieted by what our religion, parents, culture, etc. expect of us; we are never able to claim our own identity and beliefs in fear of rejection. Hanshiro, who is against the dogmatic version of the Bushido code, is ironically the one samurai who embodies the noble side of it above anyone else. I feel here Mizoguchi was trying to deliver the message that following your own beliefs and ""orders"" is far more valuable than following others orders. Anyone can be a dogmatic follower only a few can think freely and passionately enough to be a counterforce to wrong acts that are seen as societal norms. You can definitely feel that Mizoguchi was influenced by the French New way in terms of how he decides to tell the story—it's not particularly in chronological order. Instead it is a story that is told through a past story (Motome's experience). By telling both of these stories you can further understand what fueled Hanshiro to be the admirable rebel that he is.","

"Harakiri","ortiz-xiomara","18 June 2014","Soldier Masaki Kobayashi directed the Jedi-geki piece ""Harakiri"", which is about a man who is on the quest of committing sepuku (suicide), a respectable death in an honorable place for respectable Samurais. The movie starts out slow with the dialog, because the pace of the scenes and the actors are soothing on a monotone level (I understand that with the Samurais in a sacred place, that is part of their mannerism and culture). However, the more you watch the film, the pace starts to pick up as you listen to the story play on by (there are a series of flashbacks implemented into the scene). As you progress into the film, it turns out that the Samurai is looking for an honorable death, but he is also there to mock the code of the Bushido, and the unbalance that exists within the system that cost him his son in law's life in a horrid way, who he cared for as a son.Kobayashi takes us on a journey about how man, in a corrupted system, tends to either dehumanize us into walking robots, or giving us a choice to find balance in society. I though this was brilliant of him to put this film together, especially since he was a soldier himself, and got persecuted for similar parallel circumstances (not the suicide, but the system of ""doing your job"" in a military stance). Tatsuya Nakadai (who played Samurai Hanshiro Tsugumo) did a brilliant job and stole the show. There is a spiritual element in the film, but I suggest to watch the film and pay attention to the dialog, because this film will really make you think about our current society today.","

Things take an unexpected turn when he starts telling his reasons to commit this act. I know the director Masaki Kobayashi from his The Human Condition trilogy, which is in my opinion the greatest movie trilogy of all time, with parts 1 and 3 being one of the greatest movies of all time. So naturally, I was really excited to see Harakiri, the movie many people call his magnum opus, and I can say now that is definitely for a very good reason. This movie was absolutely outstanding. First of all, I really loved the pacing of the story, and how it revealed information in a very suspenseful way, that created this amazing buildup towards the end of the movie. On a personal level, this story is very harrowing. There are many scenes in this movie that I would consider to be some of the most heartbreaking and painful scenes I've ever seen. These moments are highlighted with fantastic acting, especially by Tatsuya Nakadai, whose performance in The Human Condition is one of my all-time favorites, and his performance in this movie is also definitely up there. The movie also deals with themes like honor, especially in the historical context of the Japanese samurai code, and criticizes this authoritarian culture within the samurai clans, in a very thought-provoking and interesting way. I really liked the use of music in this movie, which is very minimalistic. The black and white cinematography was outstanding. Especially framing and camera movement were excellent. Harakiri is of the greatest masterpieces in cinema history, and Masaki Kobayashi blew me away once again. I haven't seen most of his filmography yet but I can already say he is one of the greatest movie directors of all time for me.","

"Harakiri","cook_tyler_leslie","18 June 2014","Originally titled ""Seppuku,"" ""Harakiri"" is a 1962 Japanese film directed by Masaki Kobayashi. ""Harakiri"" is a narrative in nonlinear format, meaning that the order in which the film unfolds is not necessarily the order in which events transpired. I have no knowledge as to whether Tarantino has actually seen this film or cited as an influence, but it is easy to imagine this film as an influence of his, especially in relation to the nonlinear narrative, as well as the role Japanese cinema played on him.The protagonist of the film is Hanshiro, who is a ronin, or a samurai without a lord. The premise of the film is that Hanshiro travels to the house of the Ii clan, where he asks to perform seppuku, which is a type of suicide performed by samurai wherein the samurai disembowels himself with the intent of preserving his honor. The Ii clan's counselor, Saito, agrees to let Hanshiro perform seppuku. Saito tells Hanshiro of another ronin who came there wishing to perform seppuku before him. This is really where things get interesting. To preserve the viewing experience of readers who may not have seen the film yet, I will not delve into many details beyond the initial premise discussed above.""Harakiri"" is a film I would highly recommend. Essentially, the real message of the film is focused on the consequences of blinding following code or rules and the effect that that type of dogmatism can have. This is a film that will stick with you long after the initial viewing, so be prepared to question any beliefs you may hold afterwards.","

"Harakiri","SAMTHEBESTEST","14 September 2020","HARAKIRI (1962) :
Brief Review -A Legendary tale from Japanese Cinema on Samurai Honour and Traditional Facade. This is the Best Samurai Film i have ever seen till date. I mean it by all intellectual angles irrespective of what legacy other Samurai Films like ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Yojimbo"" carries. Harakiri made me feel the pain into Mysterious narrative and exposed the malicious traditional honour and abrogates. The characters study and subtle meaning in Samurai films couldn't have got better than this. In 133 minutes of runtime, Harakiri tells a story of a Ronin who requests to perform Harakiri at feudal lord's palace. This brutal suicide theory turns into a tight slap to all Ancient theories which have been worshiped by brutal lords and arrogant ronins. Action, drama, Mystery, Social Message and what not to expect from one narrative and Harakiri gets everything right on top. Tatsuya Nakadao in leading role is fantastic from the start and the protagonist Tetsuro Tamba is humanly evil as hell. The supporting cast does well in limited space and mostly in action sequences which have been performed on slow mode to have realistically elegant look. The film is set in 17th century and thankfully I don't know nothing about the Japanese culture from that era to point out faults in production design. However, the film mostly takes place in that one palace so even that production design part of nuances set in specific era didn't bother much to my brain. It all looks fine under one roof and one place. This is my first film of Director Masaki Yobakashi and undoubtedly it turned out to be an unforgettable experience. Harakiri is Masaki's only film in IMDb Top 250 Rated list (if I'm not wrong) and it deservingly holds it's ground and will hold it for years. I am trying to remember the legendary films made in 60s decade all over the world and at the moment i think Harakiri would be in Top 3 in my list.

"Harakiri","Atavisten","25 April 2005","As the Bakufu-Shogunate overtakes the power of the Daimyo, lots of samurai lose their jobs and become ronin. This is a tale about their fate, masterfully told in a way similar to Kurosawa's 'Rashomon' and Zhang Yimou's 'Ying Xiong'. This probably is typical for Asian storytelling in legends and myths, but it is so powerful it deserves a mention. Like Ibsen is known for the meaning is unraveled through retrospectives told by the head of Iyi and the protagonist Hanshiro Tsugumo.Nakudai Tatsuya plays Hanshiro Tsugumo and no one could outdo his performance here, but maybe Mifune could equal him. It just recently watched another movie in which he also played the protagonist excellently, but I couldn't remember his face so clearly (in Teshigahara's 'Tanin no Kao'). Other actors don't get much light shone on them here.The social fate of the ronin was poverty and therefore death by seppuku as it was the only fate worthy of a samurai. The movie points at this and how the House of Iyi was empowered by the same code of honour, oppression of the poor and the concealing of anything not worthy, that which is not honourable. The social commentary on the ronin may or may not be including the rest of the oppressed population, in that the ronin were not being able to get a job like the peasants because they know the way of the sword suggests that it is not. If so then its just taking a mock out of the code of honour and thats good enough for me.The ending by the way was quite excellent.","

But the Counselor who considers his request is suspicious of Hanshiro's motives, thinking the Samurai might simply be preying on his sympathies in the hopes of securing employment or being paid off and sent away. It turns out the Counselor is right to be suspicious, but very wrong about Hanshiro's motives.This movie is about the Samurai, but there aren't any elaborate battle scenes with flashing swords and bloody deaths (there is one difficult death scene). Harakiri is a mystery, almost a thriller, an intricately woven, ticking time bomb of a film. Tatsuya Nakadai (a highly respected Japanese actor) plays Hanshiro with an understated swagger, intimidating in spite of his impoverished state, but when the camera lingers on his face, we can see heartbreak in his eyes – a deep pain that has led him to question the nobility of the Samurai code.Beautifully shot in black and white, wonderfully acted, altogether a great story told by a great filmmaker (director Masaki Kobayashi). Won the Special Jury Prize at Cannes, and was nominated and/or won a number of other acting, directing and writing awards.","

In the year following his completion of his humanist epic, he made two films rather quickly. The first, The Inheritance, is an entertaining little noir, but Harakiri feels like something that has been agonized over for years before completion. The precision of the visuals, the exacting nature of the dialogue, and the complex structure that only heightens the experience all come together to create one of the great samurai movies that, because it was made by Masaki Kobayashi, is only out to demonstrate the flaws of the entire samurai system and Bushido, Kobayashi's first work in jidaigeki.A middle-aged ronin, Hanshiro (Tatsuya Nakadai) comes to the gates of the House if Iyi in Edo, asking them access to their courtyard to commit seppuku instead of leaving himself to starve in the streets in this time of great peace in Japan where unattached samurai have no hope for employment. However, the Clan of Iyi's senior counselor Saito (Rentaro Mikuni) tries to dissuade him. There have been a rash of ronin approaching great houses in Edo, begging for the same opportunity, after one ronin had been granted a position in another clan's house. Most ronin who do this now are simply deterred by a simple offering of a few coins and told to go on their way, but the Iyi Clan has decided on a different tact. Saito tells him the story of another ronin, Chijiiwa (Akira Ishihama) who came begging, and, persuaded by one of the senior samurai, Hikokuro (Tetsuro Tamba), they forced the young ronin to go through with the ceremony. Saito explains in explicit and exacting detail the torture they forced Chijiiwa to go through, including the use of his own bamboo sword to disembowel himself, despite Chijiiwa's begging for one day's respite.Hanshiro hears this tale quietly, assuring the counselor that he has never heard of Chijiiwa, that his sword is not made of bamboo, and that he has every intention of dying in the Iyi's courtyard. Saito lets him go forward, and that's where the movie gets really interesting.Hanshiro lied to Saito when he said he didn't know Chijiiwa. Waiting there for his chosen second to appear, Hikokuro, he begins to tell his tale of how he showed up at that door. He was Chijiiwa's father-in-law, brought together under the lordship of their own lord who committed seppuku ten years before at the order of the Shogun. He raised the boy along with his own, younger daughter for years in the peace of Edo where he could find no work other than the creation by hand of umbrellas. In order to save his daughter Miho (Shima Iwashita) the fate of becoming a courtesan, he begged Chijiiwa to marry her instead.I've often wondered if this movie would work as well as it does if it was just told chronologically. It would need a rewrite (there would be no need for most of the dialogue in the first thirty minutes), but it obviously could be told that way. Would it lose something? I think it really would. Most of the backstory of the film, the loss of a position for Hanshiro, his friend's seppuku, his adoption of Chijiiwa, his doting on Miho, and the hardships they all suffered together under the unfeeling, feudal system are told in a concentrated twenty-minute dose at the center of the film. By that point, we already have an understanding of Hanshiro's resignation towards death as well as having witnessed the wanton cruelty Iyi showed towards Chijiiwa. If the point of the film were the emotional character journeys, I might say that the rearrangement would be necessary, but that's not the point.Kobayashi was trying to say something very specific about the feudal system Japan had just emerged from and still lingered in a modified form. He used his characters to tell this point, that Bushido was a lie used by those in power to maintain themselves. This becomes extremely explicit later in the film, but it ends up working because of the emotional journey we follow with Hanshiro. This isn't a lecture (though Hanshiro and Saito do end up lecturing each other at one point), this is a father's final act of vengeance against a system that sent him into poverty with no way to support his daughter's virtue other than to marry her to another ronin.Probably the most affecting emotional moment is when, in flashback, Hikokuro and two others bring Chijiiwa's body back to Hanshiro, and Hanshiro discovers that Chijiiwa had sold his swords, replacing them with the bamboo weapons. Hanshiro had never even considered the selling of his own sword, for, to a samurai, his sword is his soul, but he could have sold it for the money to help save them from the desperation of poverty that had sent Chijiiwa to the doors of the House of Iyi. In not selling his own blades, he had doomed Chijiiwa to death as much as anyone.The film takes a surprisingly fun ironic twist in the fates of Hikokuro and the two other samurai, providing our first concentrated dose of samurai action in the film up to this point, but the real battle is yet to come: Hanshiro's final blow against the Iyi clan and the whole system that they abused to torture his son-in-law. He knows he's going to die, as we heard from his early dialogue with Saito, and he goes out making a blow, but there's one final bit of irony. Saito, untouched by the violence, has the entire affair swept under the rug because it would reflect badly on Iyi and their lord. Their official account makes only a small mention of Hanshiro as having committed hara-kiri in the clan's courtyard.I've praised Kobayashi's visuals before, but the way he composes his frame in Harakiri is on another level. The precision and depth of his images, especially in the beginning where he has group conversations between a dozen people of the Iyi clan in a single room, where each is completely in frame and at different distances to the camera, feels incredibly natural and allows each speaking part their ability to stand out without relying on a series of closeups that would lose the geography of the scene. The courtyard itself is filmed cleanly and mostly from afar, to keep that same clarity, but there's also an emphasis on distance that underlines the point that the system is dehumanizing.I have to take a moment to talk about Nakadai as well. For the longest time, having seen this film years ago and only relying on my memories, I was convinced that this movie starred Toshiro Mifune, but it was Mifune's costar from Yojimbo and Kurosawa's choice of his replacement in Kagemusha and Ran that took the central role of Hanshiro. He holds himself extremely well, seemingly almost dead in the beginning, barely hearing what Saito is telling him, but becoming increasingly ferocious as the film goes on. He was a strong actor, and it's interesting to note that while his performances in both Yojimbo and Black River are of the same, insane variety, he'd never really approached it again in any other work with Kobayashi, choosing to go more subtle and human, reaching his apex here.This is one of the crowning jewels of Masaki Kobayashi's body of work. It is an amazing combination of storytelling with purpose, told with incredible skill in his assured hands. This movie is great.","

"Harakiri","shoonshojima","11 February 2014","This film tells the meaning of the honor of the Samurai and the Bushido code that they lived by through an interesting way of using multiple flashbacks. Director Masaki Kobayashi leaves audiences questioning what was more important; for a man to stand for his own pride, or leave pride behind to stand for his loved ones.Being born and raised in Japan myself, after watching this film I was left thinking deeply about the true meaning of honor. At first glance, Motome Chijiiwa seems like a coward, lying to the Iyi clan asking to commit Seppuku as an attempt to get money to be asked to leave. However, through Hanshiro's story-telling, we find out that Motome was only committing such actions to pay for a doctor to save his sick family. In my opinion, I think Motome's actions are justified and he can be considered an honorable Samurai. Fighting for the lives of others is more honorable than fighting for one's own pride. In the end, the Iyi clan members who took pride in and lived by the Bushido code so much were the ones that tarnished the code themselves. In the beginning of the film, an Iyi clan red armor is shown as a representation of an honorable and glorious spirit. In the end, the same armor is shown. However, this time it seems empty, as if there was nothing for the Iyi clan to stand for anymore.I give this film a 7 out of 10 because of the unique way the story unfolds, as well as the topic that had me thinking for days.","

"Harakiri","jasongelfat","12 February 2014","""Harakiri"" is a sophisticated film that critiques the Samurai of the Tokugawa era around 1630. The order in which this story is told is crucially important to the way the viewer perceives each character on an individual basis. Although the film starts with a Ronin desiring to commit Harakiri, known as Hanshiro, it quickly turns into a flashback when counselor Saito tells the story of a man named Motome Chijiwa. The story reveals how Motome dies, but is irrelevant until Hanshiro tells his life story just before he is about to commit Harakiri. After hearing Hanshiro's detailed story, the camera angles and placement begin to play a key role in the message behind this film. Not only does it become clear that Hanshiro is at the Iyi temple with a hidden agenda, but we also start to see close up shots of Saito who is becoming deeply affected by the story being told. It sparks a possibility that maybe Saito will understand that he made a poor decision in having Motome killed, and that he should apologize to Hanshiro. On the contrary, Saito not only doesn't apologize, but he calls for an even harsher punishment on Hanshiro, thinking that he was some kind of crazy psychopath. Listening to Hanshiro's story, it made sense as to why Hanshiro was so angry, considering he may have only wanted to hear Saito admit he made a mistake. Saito is so caught up in his role as a counselor and Samurai master that he is evidently incapable of publicly expressing feelings of human emotion. This demonstrates how easily humans tend to abuse power, and how Saito cannot give in to Hanshiro's story that clearly points out Saito's mistake.""Harakiri"" is not just about the life of Samurai, but also the levels extremity in which they abide by the Boshido code. It's an interesting paradox how these samurai in the Iyi temple are so quick to judge the two Ronin who walk into their temple, yet as a viewer we tend to catch ourselves doing the same thing. There is a wide range of samurais in this film, some who are extremely dogmatic towards the Boshido code, and others who maneuver their way around it. Director Kobayashi cleverly points out the idea of humanism in cinema as it becomes the contrast to the Boshido code. Humanism shows how humans are what really matter most, and he demonstrates this, for example, with the character Hikokuro. This extremely dogmatic samurai has his hairpiece cut off in a battle with Hanshiro, which for samurai is worse than death itself, yet, Hikokuro still waits a few days before he commits Harakiri. Why? Well it raises the notion that pure and absolute dogma is a double standard in our society and is not possible for humanity. This film focuses on the significance of how history takes place in our world and how power is ultimately the factor that determines our fate. In ""Harakiri"" it was the role of Saito's power that created the entire plot and storyline for this film, and ends with a sense of ambiguity towards the significance of the samurai. This derived from witnessing the armor in the beginning with a striking and powerful presence, almost as if it were a spiritual god, and then seeing how in the end it is torn apart and put back together, as if it were something so insignificant as hanging a picture back on the wall. The metaphor of the janitors cleaning up after the battle leading to Hanshiro's death is such a large metaphor for the samurai culture and how so much can occur within their temples and how seemingly unimportant it tends to feel after the fact. Although the film has a dramatic plot, it is the critique on powerful people in society that transforms this film into a something more than your typical samurai battle movie.","

Like ""Brasil"", this movie I've seen only once in my life and many years ago, but for some reason, I still remember it (as well as the feelings that it gave me) very vividly. It is against my principals to call anything ""the best"", no matter what it is. After all, opinions are like butts. Everybody 's got his own.

It made me fall in love with the cinema of the rising sun and loose my good opinion for the Bushido. Later, ""Ghost Dog"" helped me to balance this a bit. 8)The tragedy that rolls down throughout the story forces any sensitive person to take sides and get involved with the plot, and the incredible action movie ending can only produce enthusiasm to the viewer who feels more thirsty for revenge than our ronin!Well, anyway, if you are {a} a man {b} who has the sense of honor and {c} don't consider Bush as the best thing that ever happened to the USA,this is your movie!(Few things in this century are still treated with such respect as the samurai tradition. Mostly because people do not understand its full dimentions. Watching this controversial and highly realistic film can make someone loose all his respect for beautiful legents who are mostly based on lies and an invented sense of honor and duty). Tolerance for old B/W films who don't have any special effects but they do have a plot, is also a must for enjoy it. Eutyhite!","

"Harakiri","kazjin_","23 March 2020","This may be a generalization based on what I have seen of Japanese cinema so far, but classical Japanese films seem to have a purpose beyond mere entertainment. There always seems to be an underlying message or life lesson to tell. At least, the films I have seen so far (among others Ikiru, Seven Samurai, and the Human Condition Trilogy) give room for such interpretation.HARAKIRI is no different. While many interpretations of the director's intentions gear towards a criticization (or condemnation) of Japan's feudal past and early 20th century militarism, I drew an additional conclusion. I will keep that conclusion to myself, for I don't intend or want to direct anyone towards anything.The only reason I have written this ""review"", for this film does not need more praise, is to have something to reflect upon after the next many times that I will undoubtedly watch HARAKIRI.","

"Harakiri","NoDakTatum","2 November 2023","Also known as ""Seppuku,"" this surprising Japanese tale is beautiful to look at but a discomfort to sit through. In 1630 Japan, an older stranger comes to a warlord's house to commit harakiri, an honorable suicide involving self disembowelment with a sharp blade. The head of the house tells the stranger of an earlier visitor who came to do the same thing, when in actuality the visitor was hoping to be kept on at the house as a samurai. The members of the house forced the young man to kill himself anyway. The warlord's house has its own traditions: the harakiri seekers must use their own sword to kill themselves and they must choose someone who will decapitate them as the harakiri is committed. The young visitor carried a dull sword made of bamboo, and in flashback we watch his excruciating pain as he tries to do his honorable act before finally being put out of his misery. It turns out the stranger knew the young visitor slightly. They were from the same warlord's house that was broken up earlier. The stranger readies for harakiri, and names three different men to serve as his ""second,"" the man who will remove his head at the appropriate time. What follows are many revelations as to the true relationships between the players.For a decades old film, the few instances of violence and gore here are jolting. There is much talk of honor here, and this film could serve as a parallel to Japan itself after its defeat in World War II. Should the country bow to honor and humbly accept defeat, or try to rise against its conquerors figuratively and stay proud? The black and white cinematography here is gorgeous, every frame looks like a pencil drawing. A climactic duel filmed on a windswept field is so beautiful I did not want it to end. This is the kind of film that would have suffered if shot in color. The musical score is a harsh combination of ancient instruments and dramatic percussion, resulting in spine tingling moments where only the music tells you what characters are thinking. At 134 minutes, this is dull. I mean really dull. There are just a couple of action sequences, the acting is great, but there are too many scenes of dialogue that go nowhere. Another problem: although subtitled, many of the stoic samurai warriors barely moved their lips in the scenes, resulting in confusion as to who is speaking while you read the subtitles. The story is like a good novel, but its execution is too somber and practiced. There are no light moments here, and that really adds to the tension, which comes and goes. I will recommend ""Harakiri,"" especially to Japanese film buffs, but be prepared for a film that actually seems longer than it is.","

There's way too much talking for much of the movie and it got kind of boring and even hard to follow. I feel like I would like it more if I spoke Japanese and didn't have to rely on subtitles constantly.

"Harakiri","cenclaiborne17","11 February 2014","Harakiri dives into many different themes such as perception, judgement, and loyalty. When the story of Motome is told the viewer begins pass judgement onto him and his motives. Later on we find out that his motives are essentially pure. Considering the deeper themes of the movie we see in the end a metaphor for what happens when humanism comes second to loyalty to a code. The film uses one of the most creative forms of story telling to convey a complex and deep message. The complexity of the plot adds a deep element of surprise that provokes thought. Kobayashi uses characters to represent extremes of personalities as well institutions. The film falls short many times in keeping the audiences attention, and misses out on many opportunities to capitalize on the sudden shifts in plot and tone. This consistent variable makes the film a very long winded two hours. By the end of the film you might feel as though your mind was subjected to something far more exhausting than watching a film. If you manage to power through many forced emotions from the actors and over dramatic timing than you can actually begin to appreciate the deeper themes conveyed through the story telling of the film. Kobayashi masterfully crafted scenarios in the film that made you like many of the other characters within it, because neither of you know the whole truth until you are hit with it. This film goes through great lengths humanize certain characters while limiting itself in passing judgement on others. You begin to learn that when everyone follows a certain philosophy the difference in perspective and interpretation can mean everything. Over all this film uses many different clever tactics to add depth to action and entertaining gore. Although much of the pacing of the film and cinematography leave something to be desired this is still an extremely well executed and intelligent film.","

"Harakiri","uprashanthnayak","6 March 2016","""Who can know the depths of another man's heart?"" Hanshuro TsugumoApart from its sheer story-telling gravitas and technical splendour, Kobayashi's Hara-kiri is especially lauded for its plea to look closer, to examine a little more deeply the troubles of those not as fortunate as us. When I watched it for the first time, I was blown away by the arresting wallop of this tension-saturated story's narration , and it was on the second viewing years later that I registered with more delicate acuity, its eloquent entreaty for a more compassionate look at the surface issues of our brethren. Particularly in Japan, the practice of bowing to the larger system and the concept of ""honour"" being maintained at all costs, looms especially large but of what use is honour if it makes us lose everything dear to us? Hara-kiri takes on the form of a formidable Samurai drama and builds this visceral sentiment with inexorable power, the vise of its narrative swirling and tightening until the physical carnage at the end isn't necessary - the foes have already been annihilated with gentle words. World-class cinematography and flawlessly strong acting further power this monochrome scorcher.Pic opens with a wide-angle black-'n'-white canvas , the neatness and sparse beauty of which is the trademark of director Masaki Kobayashi. Notice how clean these compositions are, whether it is the large ground ouside a chieftan's house, the inner courtyard with its settled pebbles and carefully coiffed platforms for sitting, or even a poor man's wooden house bereft of much conveniences and yet almost spacious in its tidy gestalt. The framing is immaculate when Motome Chijiwa (Akira Ishihama) - a young Samurai struggling for survival - sits with folded knee - in a martial lord's house in front of a tough-jawed warrior who listens to his case. It is 1630 in the Edo region of Japan - peace has been declared in the land but it has devolved into internal war for the highly trained swordsmen called Samurai - they find no employment now, jobs are scarce with workers pouring into any open job-site and Motome is pushed away by a supervisor who cries out that the supervisor will be punished if authorities find out that the formal warrior class is being employed for menial jobs. Motome reports to the House of Li , as other Samurai have done before him, that this utter penury is so dishonourable that he would rather commit Seppuku by disemboweling himself with his own sword in this martial house's courtyard as a final act of honour. The House of Li, manned by fierce-looking superiors, is fed up with this pattern of supposedly suicidal Samurais - they see that many such applicants are willing to accept some money and go away without killing themseles as they initially declared to do. At this stage, Kobayashi racks up the sense of foreboding , panic and icy fear with such elan that the ensuing twenty minutes ranks as one of the most implacable turn of events in black-'n'-white cinema. A few days later, a middle-aged man named Hanshuro Tsugomo (Tatsuya Nakadai), bearded and rather emaciated-looking, shows up at the House of Li with a similar request. He is told the story of Motome Chijiwa as a warning - but Tsugumo, with a wry expression that is beyond gallows humour, calmly states that he will indubitably execute as promised. As great as the previous tightly coiled sequence was, this succeding chapter matches it with its slow burn and unbearable tension which Tsugumo stretches far past breaking point with a story he unspools. Counsellor Saito (Rentaro Mikuni) , heading the house in the absence of the martial lord, is , to put it presisely - driven nuts - by this seemingly interminable narration by the grave-faced Tsugumo but I never got tired of hearing it as the latter lays one dialogue upon another like one revelatory card against the next one till the stakes indicate not just one death but many more. Saito , his strings plucked like a hen stripped to the bone , retreats to the house unable to take more.In other jidaigeki (period-films) like Kurosawa's great ""Throne of Blood"", the performances though solid do not evoke my specific praise but in Harakiri ,the thespian finesse is on prime display - this could very well have been a starkly lit theater-drama. One can almost feel the cool breeze of happiness coursing through Motome's smiling immensely relieved face after the stifling humidity of despair, alas later , stomach-churning panic sets in to seize his mien. Tsugumo's nominally amused ,mostly dead-serious physiognomy never ever raises its voice but the prosody of his message undulates with the timeless meaning of great scripture. And then there's Saito , more c**t than counsellor, who's so drunk with power and delusions of tough wisdom that his sobriety is nullified by incurable hauteur.I was vastly disappointed by the fight at the end on my first viewing - having brought me to the very peak of expectation, Harakiri's climactic sword-fight seemed not even close to the supremely choreographed ahead-of-its-time bristling magnificence of Daibosatsu toge's finisher. But then as Saito himself says , Tsugumo is a ""half-starved"" Samurai who's already been through many hells so it is perhaps unfair to expect him to again fight like Japan's greatest champion. The denouement is a sobering indictment of the way history often operates, and the film eventually reclaims its spell-binding emotional and technical territory . To watch Hara-kiri , then , is to acknowledge that even in 1962 when so much of the rest of the world was learning the ropes of top-tier movies, Japan was already capable of engineering peerless cinema.","

In the first minutes of the film I saw it as if it was about two men going to the Iyi Clan in the same day to ask for help but it was clear when the main character is the one telling the story of the other guy. That was a big twist. The director Kobayashi did a unique style in which tricks the mind for the viewer to think this way. It also shows the humanity in each character in their expressions and thoughts. At the end this film said to me to not judge someone look and to do whats feels right and not what a rule said, meaning of who is really a real human. Emotionally it affected me when the wife cries for her husband because of a pass experience. Then when the main character fights with the Samurais, I wanted him to take revenge towards all but it does not happen. Its another film in which makes you question the history of a country.","

The beginning of the film can be a bit confusing if you don't pay close attention to what is going on. You are lead into a very teeth-clenching moment of watching a man (Motome) perform Harakiri with a bamboo sword in front of his peers. One of the most visually gruesome scenes I have seen in a film. While the scene is very graphic, it serves it's purpose in setting up the film for how meaningful the film is to Japanese, Samurai and just human nature in general. At the start of the film, we don't know much about this man behind the ""disrespectful"" bamboo sword but as the movie goes on, we learn more and more about Motome and the reason behind his flaws in following the strict Bushido Code. The film shows a Renoir-esc way of thinking; every man has his reasons for his choices and every man has a story. According to the Samurai culture, Motome was a disgrace to the name of Samurai and deserved little respect. Little did the Iyi clan know that Motome had good reason for the way he was. Along with the Renoir-esc message, there is a beautiful message of humanism and the problems with extreme power. It is shown how when people are in power, they often abuse it. By the end of the film, you will have a good idea of the Samurai culture, the good parts and the bad, and it makes you think again before quick judging someone.","

The other feature that makes this movie one of a kind is the way Kobayashi is able to take almost a humanistic approach to a movie that could easily be made into good against bad. He does so by making us understand both sides of the equation and leaving the judgment of who's right up to the viewer. The movie kept me surprise at every angle and although it seemed slow and predictable to me at the beginning, my mindset quickly changed after a good 20 minutes into it.

"Harakiri","MeesTW","23 September 2017","Kobayashi making a superb Samurai film in the early '60s is like David Vs. Goliath. Kurosawa was on top of his game at this time, and somehow Masaki Kobayashi managed to create a Samurai film on par with the quality of Kurosawa, while staying true to his own style and merit instead of copying what others did before him.The first thing that struck me was that this film, more than 50 years later, still looks fantastic. Especially the great use of high contrast lighting, something you barely see in Japanese productions, set the tone both visually and thematically. The director of photography uses a lot of symmetric shots which look beautiful but tell a story as well. For me the highlight of this film was Motome Chijiiwa's seppuku. This scene was shocking, absurd and also very unpredictable. Excellent editing and cinematography created an unforgettable, yet uncomfortable moment. The turn of events, which slowly unfold as the film progresses is unexpected and will surprise you. But most of all, it will impress you. The director uses some very (without giving too much away) notable techniques to strengthen the effect.Tatsuya Nakadai, one of the greats in Samurai cinema, has some of the most amazing body language you will ever see in movies! I noticed how much work and detail he put into this character by not focusing on his eyes, but rather on his feet - which show that he really is portraying a Samurai. My only flaw is that the beginning of the film, the first twenty minutes or so, does not set the tone which I found to be a bit confusing and off putting.This is one of the greatest films from the golden age of Japanese cinema. It holds up very well and you will walk away very satisfied. If you get the chance, go watch it!","

"Harakiri","fraser-simons","22 July 2023","The only gripes you could find with this are due to the restoration of the film and the time it was filmed. For instance, on close-ups, because it's in high definition now, you can sometimes see makeup and masking for their hair. The battles, as with all of them at the time, use blocking and shot changes, or else fairly fake looking padding when the sword goes through a ""body"".None of it bothered me though, since it was absolutely perfect on all other fronts. From start to finish it is riveting. It's timeless in what it attempts to communicate while also being a period piece. Your allegiance as to who you are rooting for shifts in an elegant way, and the pacing between past events and future is just immaculate.","

"Harakiri","bot-celine","13 February 2014","The way Masaki Kobayashi filmed this movie was unlike anything I've ever seen. At the beginning we are introduced to a young samurai who is now a ronin, Tsugumo Hanshirō, who comes to the house of the Iyi Clan asking permission to perform Harakiri on his property. The clan becomes very angry when they discuss whether they should let him or not, knowing that many ronin have gone to many clans asking to perform harakiri, with no intentions of doing so, but instead getting sent away with some money. Believing that young Hanshirō had no intention of harakiri, and just wanted money, they granted him his wish to preform the sacred act on their land. Now you can see how distraught Tsugumo looks, and we almost feel happy. They caught him in his shameful act, now making him commit suicide seems almost justifiable instead of downright cruel. Tsugumo begs them for just a day or two, he swears he'll come back but now the samurais are set on teaching this disgraceful samurai a lesson and won't let him leave, even when they discover his swords are wooden. It's shocking, but you feel the need to side with the Iyi Clan, believing what they did is justifiable. Then, as the story goes on, we come to realize Tsugumo came there as a last resort, looking for any way to save his dying wife and dying child. He sold his swords, an ultimate form of disgrace in this culture, to help feed them and take care of them. He would do anything for them, even risk his life and his honor. Showing us that even though samurais live and die by the Bushido code, there are things that take precedence over that, like family and love. This film is a great example of that, and was directed beautifully.","

If the relationship between Bushido itself is set aside, Dazhe reflected in this film is also thought-provoking. Regardless of the political domination and administrative significance, some of the so-called ""morality"" used to restrain people may be manifestations of a contradictory complex . While asking others to obey this way, when ""moral"" conflicts with real life and human nature, can you know how to choose? May not be immersive and never reach a conclusion. This film sings an elegy for the samurai class, which is real and sighable.","

It gave us a very dark and human insight of the life of a warrior. It also talks about how the leader of 'klans' play so dirty to sustain a blind illusion of order and prosperity.

"Harakiri","slowcando","18 January 2024","Harakiri is the fourth classic-Japanese film I've seen, after Samurai 1 Musashi, Rashomon, Seven Samurai. It is comfortably my favourite as unlike the others it hasn't noticably dated nor has any clear flaws.The glacial pace doesn't drag as we're treated to a near-constant stream of visually-striking compositions, a photographer's film! The black-n-white is quite beautiful, with just the right amount of contrast (I recommend the Bluray, for optimal dynamic range).What the camera does is one thing, a good film still needs a compelling narrative, and we get that too. The first half-hour is a little confusing, but once the story finds its groove (or rather, once the viewer has 'tuned in') then it's quite gripping. We want to know what Tsugumo's game is...The most impressive accomplishment of the narrative is how it puts its main message across, regarding bushido. I won't explicitly state that message here, as first-time viewers should experience it within the film. It's an impressive ending.The cast are all decent, music totally sparse yet effective. Subtitles were fine, clear & concise. The action is mostly quite good (for an early-60's flick) tho' there was one sword-swipe which clearly missed its mark despite the victim falling prey to it. Forgiveable, given the age of the film...and understandable, given the actors used real swords! The sets and setting feel authentic, tho' lacking a little in variety. While the slow pacing and precise dialogue isn't an issue, it does make Harakiri a 'watch-when-in-the-mood' type film...not one to put on at any time.Overall a strong 8/10. The first classic-japanese to get that score. I already enjoy anime & horror from Japan-cinema (Akira, Grave of the Fireflies & The Grudge are probably my top 3 japanese films)...I wasn't sure if the 50's/60's stuff was for me. Now with Harakiri I'm beginning to see the appeal. On account of this strong showing the next film of this ilk will be from the same director: either Kwaidan or deep dive into his Human Condition trilogy.","

Why are the three ""seconds"" no shows for the second suicide? And, the answers aren't the ones you expect.

"Harakiri","muddlyjames","6 February 2002","While initially appearing to be a study of the eternal conflict between individual needs and the demands of tradition, HARAKIRI is actually a clear-eyed and savage indictment of human (particularly male) vanity.To me there are two key scenes in the film. First, the enforced ritual suicide of the young samurai early in the film. This has got to be one of the most brutal, toe-curling scenes ever put on film (although there is no gore). What is particularly striking is the juxtaposition of the twisting, writhing, screaming man against the silent, immobile, formally arranged background. This has the effect of giving the environment, or tradition/society/law, increased weight and making the individual appear weaker, transient, more mutable, and thus more subject to error. In other words Kobayashi appears to pay all due deference to the culture and belief system that have created the horror we have just witnessed. He consciously uses the the techniques of classic formalist Japanese cinema (static shots, formal spatial design, exactly replicated point of view shots, etc.) to give us a sense of the weight and power of custom bearing on the individual.The second scene comes at the end of the middle section of the film during which time we have been given a detailed examination of the relationships between the members of the small family and the increasing sense of desperation and despair that has entered the home with the deadening encroachment of poverty. When the temple officials tell the tale of the ""honorable death"" of the young father in this setting (they are somewhat more brightly lit - ""cleaner"" than their surroundings) THEY are now what appears mutable or insubstantial and their talk of fame, honor, and tradition is perceived as pompous, empty cant. In short they are shown as posturing, bullying members of some ""boys club"" whose membership is based on vanity and who are totally divorced from the realities of existence. These realities would include, most prominently, our duties to our family and friends, not just our personal honor (ego?). At this point in the film the young father's begging now appears an act of courage and virtue, his suicide would have been one of cowardice and vanity. The film suggests that suicide may be the easier of the choices faced by those placed in the position of this father in this culture. Death provides social approval, lasting fame, and freedom from the grind of responsibility. Continuing to be a husband and father would here only bring disgrace. This could be seen as a powerful indictment of what can occur when women are not accorded a place of respect and/or authority within a culture.This is a passionate, clear-eyed, stringently crafted film that is marred only very slightly by occasional use of that addiction of 60's filmakers: the zoom lens, and an (admittedly exciting) action ending that somewhat distracts from the film's main themes (love the toppling of that idol though). 9.5/10.","

"Harakiri","igoldan","23 October 2019","It's an interesting movie that shows the fall of the samurai culture. The so much worshipped ""honor"" turns out to be mostly fake in the house. The samurai turn out to be liars pretending to be ill to avoid committing suicide. The young guy who is portrayed as dishonored and humiliated in the beginning actually turns out to be a brave one. And the fact that the father was able to fight a dozen of well-trained and well-fed samurais at the end really shows that the concept was not as authentic and romantic as we might perceive it nowadays.
Overall, it's a good movie but I felt it was a bit too long.","

"Harakiri","judemcrobbie","11 February 2021","Let's be honest, if you're watching this it's because you either want to watch a samurai, foreign language or highly rated movie. I'd have to recommend you watch Seven Samurai (1954) by Akira Kurosawa first.
Harakiri, to me, just lacked the immersion factor to keep me hooked. I believe this is for a multitude of reasons:
Firstly, there are two stories of sorts. One of which is the Samurai telling his story before committing Harakiri. The second is how he got to that point. These two stories separately would work however they do not share the same amount of action throughout. This is the thought about rising action through movies and how that should be applied to keep the audience invested. Harakiri does not do that and therefore lacks the urgency needed.
Secondly, the second act was much weaker than the first and last as there was basically no action, which felt necessary as they foreshadowed and alluded to it but it never came, leaving a sense of an unanswered question.
Thirdly and lastly, the amount and use of exposition. Sometimes exposition can be done eloquently, but in this it is clunky and does not fit in. For example, a samurai (about to commit Harakiri) is asking about it.
There are a lot of things good with this movie however. Namely the score and cinematography. This is one of the best shot movies I've seen. Obviously it's in a grainy, black-and-white and I don't even think you can see it in in HD. But those shots and camera movements is jaw-dropping at times. And the score is, for lack of a better word, weird. Its much less music and a combinations of sounds. This truly makes for an incredible sound experience, as the combination of drums, silence and shrill notes creates incredible tension alone. This score is so good that you could sense the emotion without hearing dialogue, nor seeing visuals.
The act of Harakiri itself is definitely a not-so-subtle metaphor for masculinity, pride and mental health; predominately in men. Especially how they would rather 'bite the bullet' or, in this instance, take a painful sword to the abdomen than have to confront taking. This is doubly so as through the movie as he has responsibilities of a men, to his children and his faction.
I like it, especially the concept, but it's just a bit slow and ungripping for me.","

"Harakiri","Shilo_R_A","27 May 2023","Harakiri is a 1962 samurai film, directed by Masaki Kobayashi. It takes place in 17th century Japan, finally peaceful times for the nation after a long era of war and bloodshed. Many samurai are now masterless, ""ronin"", struggling to survive in a world that no longer needs their skill as warriors. Hanshiro Tsugumo, now a ronin as well, arrives at the gates of the Iyi clan with one request: a proper place to kill himself in the ritual of seppuku, as his life are too poor and devoid of honor to go on living. As his interactions with the clan proceed and his intentions are slowly examined and unraveled, we learn that there is more than meets the eye to Tsugumo's request.This movie is a slow-burn, with its first half handling the suspense surrounding Tsugumo's story in a very immersive, satisfying and masterful way. The premise of the film sounds simple at first, but it's developed slowly, each detail revealed making an impact upon the viewer, and it really got me hooked on my first time watching.The cinematography is pretty straight forward, but the harsh compositions often do well in showing the brutality of the world, the unforgiveness where we might have expected something else. The bamboo-sword scene is easily one of the best in the whole film for this exact reason, this harshness in which everything is presented. The slow, excruciating pain of the scene, made me feel like I was there. Love it.The ominous soundtrack adds a lot to the immersiveness of the film, its dark and twisted notes fitting to the era in which the movie takes place, foreboding, bare and odd. Like it a lot, as well.Tatsuya Nakadai is especially great as Tsugumo, communicating the grit he has along with his special kind of cynicism, and his softer side as well. Range is shown here, definitely. The other actors were solid as well, though nothing as impactful or memorable acting-wise, in my opinion.After the halfway point of the film I feel like it has some heavy exposition, that made this part of the film a little more tiresome to watch. It's important and I don't know if there was a way to communicate this part of the story better (and right from the topknot moment and until the end of the movie, things get exciting again), but it was less smooth than the first half, for sure.I'd also like to say that this film is not very rewatchable, to me at least- its slowness is fine when you don't know the details of the story, but on rewatch the movie is a little tougher to digest, since you already know everything that should keep you in suspense, there isn't that much to unpack, and things overall move me less. I was quite tired when rewatching the movie, so maybe that had a bit of an impact, but I still think that what I've said is relevant.In conclusion, Harakiri is a pretty solid film. Its first half is full of suspense, a well-crafted slow-burn that lets us into the harsh and brutal world of the samurai, and even though there's a little tiresome (but essential) part in the middle of the film it also ends in a strong note. Not very rewatchable, but definitely worth watching. I'm feeling an 8.1/10 on this one.","

"Harakiri","hick1384","19 December 2000","Robbie Lynch""Hara-kiri"" is a great film that challenges the strict adherence to traditions and rituals. The story took many unpredictable twists and turns. This, combined with the great use of the camera, made for an unforgettable movie. The movie began with a former samurai named Hanshiro Tsugumo who asked permission to commit Hara-kiri (traditional samurai suicide) at the House of Iyi.  The members of the House let Hanshiro in and tried to scare him off by telling him of a former samurai who had tried to do the same feat.  That samurai was named Motome Chijiiwa.  He had come to the House threatening Hara-kiri, but he had really wanted money.  The elders, however, accepted his request as truth and granted him permission to commit Hara-kiri. Motome was obviously surprised at this response and asked for a day or two to take care of his affairs and then to return.  This request was refused and the Hara-kiri ritual commenced.  However, the ritual had not run smoothly. Motome's sword was not made of steel but of bamboo. Despite this disgrace, Motome was still forced to commit Hara-kiri.  Motome killed himself with great difficulty and while so doing further disgraced himself by having bitten off his tongue. Hanshiro Tsugumo was not moved by this story and still threatened to commit Hara-kiri.  The elders once again accepted the request and the ritual began. Before the ritual began, however, Hanshiro asked for the right to pick his second (the one who would cut off his head after Hanshiro disemboweled himself with his sword).  The request was granted.  However, the three men Hanshiro selected as his second were not well that day.  While messengers were sent to one of the three men, Hanshiro told his story. Hanshiro told of how eleven years earlier his friend was dying and asked Hanshiro to look after his son.  Hanshiro accepted the request and responded to his friend that he would protect the son with his life, while raising his own daughter as a single parent.  The son was actually Motome.  Hanshiro went on to explain how Motome and his daughter, Miho, become married.  The couple then bore a son named Kingo.  Since Motome was a former samurai, he could not find any work so he was forced to sell his sword blades (which are part of his soul) in order to support his family.  One day Kingo grew terribly ill and needed a doctor, but the family had no money.  So Motome went to the House of Iyi in hopes of stealing some money but he never returned.  Later Motome's body was returned to Miho.  Two days later Kingo died and within three days after that, Miho died.  Hanshiro went on to tell how he secured revenge by cutting of the top hair knots of the three best swordsmen in the House of Iye (acts which were worse than death), the same three men whom he had just requested to act as the second in the Hara-kiri ritual.  (Those three men later killed themselves.) Hanshiro then made the case that the rituals are ridiculous.  He only wished that he had sold his sword in order to pay for a doctor to help his grandson, Kingo.  The Lord of the House was not sympathetic to Hanshiro's story and the men in the House attacked Hanshiro.  Because he was such a great warrior, Hanshiro killed four men and wounded eight others.  While he was killing himself, he was shamefully shot.  The Lord of the House rewrote history and said that Motome, Hanshiro, and the four men that had been killed by Hanshiro had all committed Hara-kiri.  The Lord further reported that the three who had killed themselves because Hanshiro had cut their knot of hair had died of illness. ""Hara-kiri"" showed that rituals are sometimes unjust and, in order to live, they must at times be broken.  ""Hara-kiri"" was an amazing movie with simple graphics, little action, but with a powerful story line.","

Hey Dr. McMahon Hara Kiri is a movie that displays the shallowness of the samurai code of honor.  This movie begins with its eponymous character, Hanshiro Tsugume, in a desperate state of affairs that has led him to the gate of the Clan Iyi house. There he begs to use the mansion for hara kiri, ritual suicide.  The elders of the Iyi Clan are faced with a two-pronged problem; first they can offer Hanshiro a pittance and hope he goes on his way.  This will led to more ex-warriors appearing at their gates in hope of receiving a handout. The other choice they can make is to allow Hanshiro to commit seppuku are use him as an example for anyone else who dares to come to the Iyi household looking for charity.  The elders choose to allow Hanshiro to perform hara kiri without knowing the grave consequences that it holds for them. Once the decision to allow Hanshiro to kill himself has been made, the elders question him to find out if he really plans on doing so or simply wants charity.  While questioning him the elders mention that another warrior, Montome Chijiiwa, appeared a few months prior to his own arrival asking the same question that he is.  The elders go on to tell of Montome's disgraceful death due to the fact that he was carrying bamboo blades. Little do the elders know that Montome is Hanshiro's son-in-law, and had been carrying bamboo blades because he sold his real ones to provide for his family's welfare.  While preparing to proceed with the ritual, Hanshiro asks for the three best swordsmen of the household to be his second and behead him.  As each is called he turns out to be absent due to illness or fatigue. Hanshiro goes forth to tell of why the three are not present that day and it is because each has lost his top knot of hair to Hanshiro and this is a disgrace worse than death for a samurai.  The elder, infuriated, orders his men to kill Hanshiro.  Hanshiro kills and maims twelve of the Iyi retainers before committing hara kiri and being shot by the surviving Iyi warriors. This shows of how the honor code held by the samurai is often only skin deep and often bent.  This is demonstrated by the fact that each of the three top warriors would not attend the seppuku because they have lost their topknot.  This is also shown in the scene where Hanshiro is shot to death. Guns are not the weapons of a warrior, blades are, and to kill a warrior with a gun greatly deifies their code of honor.  The elders also violate the code when they institute a massive cover-up of the whole incident claiming that their retainers died due to illness and Hanshiro died solely due to self-inflicted wounds.  This movie does an excellent job bringing to light the problems incurred by a honor that is filled with pride.","

"Harakiri","demathaguy","21 December 2000","Seppuku, a film directed by Masaki Kobayashi, is simply a movie masterpiece with amazing cinematography. It  displays a stunning story of revenge. The film is shot in a style where almost every scene is framed with the many rectangular and square shapes of the Japanese houses. This ""framing"" mirrors the way the story is told. It is a story set within a story, set within a story. The film opens with a clan retainer writing the events of a day in a book. We then look at the actual day and what it contained. The inner story is of a samurai Hanshiro Tsugumo, an ex-warrior who is without a job in a time of peace. Hanshiro approaches the clan house of Iyi seeking a holy place to preform Hara kiri. Hara kiri, also known as Seppuku, is an honourable way for a samurai to commit suicide. The samurai uses his own sword to disembowel himself before a second, a swordsman behind him, decapitates the samurai. Hanshiro's request was a very common event in those times. Many times a clan, instead of granting the samurai their wish for a holy site,  would instead provide the exwarrior with food, clothes, or money. Sometimes they would even bring the masterless warrior into their own clan. Upon hearing Hanshiro's request, a clan official tells  him  a story of the samurai Motome Chijiiwa.  Chijiiwa also approached the house of Iyi a month earlier. Chijiiwa  requested a place to preform Hara Kiri. Chijiiwa though, was only though seeking money. Chijiiwa meets a terrible fate because the Honourable clan elders decide they do not want their clan to be known as one which offers food, money or clothes to just any samurai requesting seppuku. This they felt, would bring floods of samurai to their house. The clan forces Chijiiwa to preform Hara kiri but upon inspecting his blades, they find that they are merely blades of bamboo. It is said that ""a samurai's sword is his soul."" Chijiiwa is forced to die by the sword of bamboo. Hanshiro, after hearing this story, is asked again, if he really wishes to request their holy place to preform Hara kiri. His reply: yes. This is merely the opening to an astonishing story. The movie Seppuku is a beautifully crafted masterpiece of revenge and honour amo","

"Harakiri","TedBradford","2 January 2001","(Don't read this if you haven't seen the movie)Dear Dr. McMahon,Masaki Kobayashi's Hara Kiri presents the viewer with several interesting criticisms of Japanese society which have relevance in western society as well. The movie is a commentary on the social elite and on the way the truth is presented as opposed to the actual truth.Even from the onset of the movie Kobayashi is poking at the social elite. He starts with the image of smoke blowing around a hollow statue of a member of the samurai class. He develops this idea throughout the movie and blatantly beats the viewer over the head with it with the way he portrays the head of the house of Iyi. With the abolishment of many feudal houses brings an excess of samurai. These ronin roam the country in poverty because their honour code does not allow them to work. Motome at one point in the movie tries to get a job but is unable to because of his status. The honour code is a set of superficial rules which have little to do with actual honour. It's more about how a person dresses and wears their hair than any achievement moral or physical. Surprisingly one of the only things these samurai can do for food or money is threaten to commit seppuku. The honour code does not allow honest work but it does allow threatening people in an attempt to extort money out of them. Motome sells the blades of his swords to try to save his dying wife and son. The self-righteous head of the house of Iyi lives in luxury while the truly righteous Hanshiro and Motome live in poverty on the verge of starvation.The head of the house of Iyi is made to be loathed in all of his self-righteousness. He looks down upon Motome who is trying as hard as he can to save his family, forces him to disembowel himself with a sword made of bamboo as he watches and jokes about it as if he was more noble because of Motome's shame. Then Hanshiro stalked and fought the three best swordsman of Iyi, showing the conflict between the honour code and true honour. In an effort to pick at the social elite he doesn't attack the people but the greater symbol of the elite, the topknot worn by all samurai. Then in his battle with Hikokuru Omagdaka the premier swordsman of the house of Iyi, the very best the social elite has to put forward, Hanshiro not only cuts the topknot off his head but he breaks his sword in two, destroying the most sacred symbol of the samurai. Hanshiro then goes after the house of Iyi itself, he picks up the stuffed samurai and throws him to the ground breaking it into many pieces.  Kobayashi never attacks any people in specific but the symbols which all the people live under.Then Kobayashi starts picking at the way truth is portrayed. Through the two separate tellings of the story about Motome two very different ideas of a person are shown. The first is of an honourless ronin who doesn't even have enough respect for the system to have real swords. The other is of a loving father and husband who realized what was more important false honour or family members. Then after hanshiro destroys the honour of the house of Iyi, the head of the house of Iyi writes that nothing happened that day in his journal. He forces several of his men to commit seppuku, says men killed by Hanshiro died of illness and stages a massive cover up and clean up operation to hide his disgrace. The head of the house of Iyi becomes this amazing tyrant who bends the will of his men, the life of several, and then rewrites history itself.","

There are too many movies dealing with family dramas, not only movies but also TV shows and even in CF. I don't want to see any more family dramas. And one more, this screenwriter always draws such a script. In other words, it is a technique that advances the story by interweaving the present and the past. Looking at this movie alone is a great composition, but I's spoiled to see many other works written by this screenwriter.
Also, since it is a story that only revenges resentment, it feels shallow as a story. Since the story is a little shallow, I think the director made efforts to push this story to the higher label movie.","

"Harakiri","IrishDteam","14 January 2002","Dear Dr. McMahon, In the film Seppuku, a fluid portrayal of the morals upheld by Japanese society is only the surface of the black and white masterpiece. Through this medium the director is incredibly successful at insinuating and attacking many social issues that plagued the world in the 60's, when the film was made, and continue to act as a disease which is slowly gnawing away at the society which we all live in today. Its ironic that stories that are set centuries before the time in which they are presented, are more than often more relevant to present issues than many of the attempts made in what is considered the ""modern style"". No movie proves this point more true than Masaki Kobayashi's Seppuku, with camera work that is eerily reminiscent of still photography, each scene unique and harrowing in the feeling of tranquillity that penetrates the very skin of the viewer. This is the backbone to the film that provides both emotions and acts as a stage for the powerful events, that from the very beginning prove ominous and awaiting disaster. The happenings that ensue are laden with a quality that seems to be perfected by the director, the subtle art that is symbolism. It would be hard to find a movie that uses more techniques for exhibiting symbolism, this alone makes Seppuku a rare work. Seemingly around every corner lies another allusion or example of the corruption that surrounds the central scene of the movie, The House of Iyi. It would be an injustice to be cursory in examining the various symbols that are in the movie, rather each one deserves a complete and thorough dissection respectively. The hero of the story, Hanshiro, has exposed the corruption of the House of Iyi which stolidly made the statement that it is a honorable place. Through the movie we find out of the hard times which fall upon the daughter, son-in-law and grand-daughter of Hanshiro. We are made aware that the journey that Hanshiro makes to the house is not that of discovery and closure(by his request to commit Hara-Kiri), but rather of an objective of vengeance that is both silent and furious, portrayed perfectly by Tatsuya Nakadai. When Hanshiro is blamed by the head of Iyi that he has attempted to bring shame and dishonor to the house, the hero makes it clear that the place never had any to begin with. The House being the symbol of authority and the protagonist being the symbol of insurrection to an unjust system, the fate of the man is predictable, as is true in ""real life"". The order of the killing of Hanshiro is imminent, and is taken head on by the willing hero. During the time where Hanshiro explains of his motivations for the request of Hara-Kiri at this particular house, he sits attentively on a plain white mat. As the story proceeds and the order of death is made, Hanshiro remains on the mat, being attacked at all sides.  Pride and lunacy is a dangerous combination when fighting, and when attacked, this mixture proves to be fatal for the House of Iyi. Many lives are lost while trying to slay this one man and the first deaths occur on the mat where Hanshiro began the tale. The previously white mat is now stained with a black streak that seeps deep into the cloth. After many more casualties on the part of the House, Hanshiro finally finishes what he came to the house to do, commits ritual Hara-Kiri, leaving the House in chaos. A proud establishment will try with all of its might to remain in the image of what it thinks it is, covering up whatever is necessary to uphold the guise of its ideals. While the blood of this event marks numerous places where embarrassment occurred, it is for the most part cleaned up, leaving no sign of any sort of threat to normalcy. All that is, save the sheet where Hanshiro was sitting.  While cleaning up after the disaster, minions of Iyi take off the cloth that covers the board that Hanshiro was formerly kneeling on. The board is the justification that is held by the hero, attached firmly to the ground, and when the sheet is removed the viewer realizes that the beliefs that were held by Hanshiro were no mere front, but rather a true and enduring persistence for what he believed in. Of course nothing would be more fitting than a lasting example of the righteous rebel and the establishment which he fought against. While the stain on the sheet is taken to be washed, the camera remains fixed on the board, an identical mark of blood remains. No matter how much it may think it has stayed the same, the house has been effected by this occurrence. The possible references that can be made by this symbolism are both untold and unspecified. Analogies are applicable no matter what you are trying to compare, whether it be a ruling government, a specific person, or perhaps just a stab at authority and its corruption in general. Power enables ability to for the most part, erase, or cover up anything that could appear contrary to the ideas that are expressed by the one in power. The film Hara-Kiri though gives an uplifting reminder to all oppressed and a biting example to the oppressors; that even though a wrong can be covered up and washed, the stain will remain.","

While many consider Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai to be the greatest Samurai film in history, many true enthusiasts believe this honour belongs to Kobayashi's Harakiri. A film which has not received as much attention due to its limited release in North America, is now gaining attention due to its tremendous criterion collection release.It is an astounding masterpiece telling the story of an aging samurai on his quest to commit Seppuku (Harakiri). With storytelling and cinematography light years ahead of its time, it is difficult to leave this movie without a greater love for film and the filmmaking process. One of the few movies that will truly give you a full appreciation for the Samurai art form. An astonishing masterpiece is every sense of the word.","

"Harakiri","nishad-2","7 June 2011","I'd never seen a Samurai film before this one. But I would assume that Masaki Kobayashi's Hara-Kiri isn't like your traditional samurai film, this one is different so I'm told. I'll admit, I expected ninja fight scenes and a lot of fast zoom in's to crazy ninja faces. But this film is more about the Japanese culture and more or less, ones honor as a Samurai. At the start of the film, we meet a ronin by the name of Hanshiro Tsugumo who applies to the Iyi Clan for the opportunity to commit open and willing Hara-Kiri- ritualized self-destruction. The court official relates the request to another ronin's similar request. Kobayashi takes direct aim at Japan's rigid system of clans, Samurai and the almost obsessive code of honor. Instead of action filled fight scenes and sword battles, we are filled with thick dialogue. I don't think Kobayashi likes the Samurai culture very much. Though it was beautifully filmed, Hara-Kiri wasn't to my liking. I guess subconsciously, I expected much different than it turned out to be.","

The samurai who claim to value honor above all either just use honor as a tool to protect their pride, or are simply too foolish to see the holes in their philosophy. Harakiri has perhaps the most genius structure in the history of film, a structure that's rather simple but equal parts thrilling and makes the story even more tragic. Nakadai delivers one of his greatest performances as a man broken and driven insane by a culture he used to value and respect.","

While we are examining this, it enters through the window of traditions and exits through the window of humanity, a great order of expression. In fact, he emphasizes how traditions will become stereotyped to a degree that will destroy humanity over time. This stereotype is growing so much that now customs produced by people anonymously are coming across humanity, just like the giant you created yourself. Tatsuya's super acting also adds to this. The film already reflects its period one-on-one, you feel yourself somewhere there. It reflects their families and customs very well. I advise you to pay attention to Harakiri, because even if you say that I will do harakiri, it's a crime. You will understand these last words when you watch the movie. Be sure to watch, applause.","

"Harakiri","realvedmak","26 September 2013","I have just finished watching this film few minutes ago. My expectations were pretty low, I knew nothing about it prior to watching it, and I had no idea where movie was going for first 30 minutes or so.There are few things I did not like, such as characters being slightly underdeveloped, and really none were likable. By the end of the movie I felt that main character accomplished nothing as the ""bad guys"" simply covered up their lack of honour and went on to prosper. So why would I give it a 10? Well, its simple. I believe in either suggesting one watch a movie, and give it a 10, or suggesting movie is a waste of time and giving it a 1. This movie, despite its shortcomings, is extremely well put together. Story felt very real, as in ""it could have happened"". Movie prompts one to question what they would do if they were in place of one of characters, and it felt particularly close to me as it points out the issue of what happens to soldiers when there is no war for them to fight in. Those that have fought in wars and came home just to need to readjust might get what I mean, otherwise be glad you don't know what its like.Considering it was made in 1962 and that it is about time period far earlier than that, and that I saw it in 2013 and loved it, this movie really stands the test of time.My advice would be to see this movie. If you start watching it, and it feels slow, or that it is going nowhere, exercise bit of patience, it gets better. End is very unpredictable, a real rarity for me, and while it left me wanting more clear vindication for one character, I believe character got it, in a meaningful way to himself, and that I felt it was not enough perhaps due to cultural differences.","

Ii Naomasa was an ally of Tokugawa Ieyasu and his men were among the very few allowed to wear a red armor. He took an important role in many battles with Ieyasu, included the battle of Sekigahara. And, after his death in 1602, his clan took part successfully in both Osaka campaigns (1614-15). His loyal support to the Tokugawa led them to be a powerful clan.The film makers date all the drama in the times where samurai did still remember how to wear an armor.Very good film!","

"Harakiri","butterz187","4 January 2003","DO NOT READ IF U DIDN'T SEE THE MOVIEThe compelling tale of Seppuku, Masaki Kobayashi's visual masterpiece, takes place during the feudal era in seventeenth century Japan.  This film, as well as several other films directed by Kobayashi, was inspired by his own individual wartime experience.  Each of Kobayashi's works reverberate his passionate disdain of societal authority and political corruption. Kobayashi was an analytical mastermind because of his extraordinary ability to dispute the abuse of power clearly and sensibly.  Seppuku is the enigmatic story of how absolute power blinds those who possess it from seeing or believing a virtuous reality. The protagonist of the story is Hanshiro Tsugumo, an aged and unemployed samurai.  He had lost everything that had any value to him, so he journeyed to the House of Iyi, the mansion inhabited by a respected samurai clan, to perform harakiri, the Japanese ritual where a samurai living in shame commits suicide by  means of eviscerating oneself.  This is the most honorable type of death for this situation. Tsugumo arrived at the House of Iyi prepared to die.  The clan elder of the House of Iyi questioned Tsugumo's `true' motive because of  previous impoverished unemployed samurai who threatened to perform harakiri only to extort money from the wealthy clan.  The clan elder then told Tsugumo of a specific instance where this `dishonorable' behavior occurred. The clan elder told Tsugumo about the story of Motome Chijiiwa, in an attempt to uncover his `true' motive.  Chijiiwa, like Tsugumo, was a member of the disbanded Shogunate clan.  When the clan elder asked, `Did you know Chijiiwa?' Tsugumo gave no immediate answer.  The clan elder continued with his story and said that the clan forced Chijiiwa to perform harakiri even when he asked to be given a boon.  The most sickening aspect of Chijiiwa's death was that he had to perform harakiri with a sword made from bamboo, which meant his soul was worthless in the samurai culture because one's sword is one's soul. After the story Tsugumo was asked if he still wanted to perform harakiri. The unshaken Tsugumo did not waver in his decision to perform harakiri, but he first had to choose a second, a samurai that assists one in harakiri by cutting off one's head when their entrails are completely exposed . Coincidentally, out of three seconds, none were present that day at the House of Iyi.  Tsugumo requested that one of the three men that he had requested be summoned to accompany him for his performance of harakiri. While a group of clan members were summoning the three absent samurais, Tsugumo told the members of the House of Iyi the tragic incidents in his life that led him to want to perform harakiri. In this story Tsugumo revealed that he did know Motome Chijiiwa, he took care of him when Chijiiwa's father died.  Tsugumo treated him like a son. Years later, Tsugumo asked Chijiiwa to marry his precious daughter Miho. Chijiiwa reluctantly said yes to his mentor's proposal due to his financial state.  After Miho and Chijiiwa were married, they had a child.  Shortly after the child was born, Miho and the baby became extremely ill.  The family did not have enough money for a doctor, so they could not receive treatment.  Chijiiwa tried various ways of obtaining money, but  none worked.  Chijiiwa then traded in his precious sword for money to treat his wife and his son.  When Chijiiwa returned home, he told Tsugumo and Miho that he was going to journey to a moneylender in another city, and that he would return soon.  When he did not return, Tsugumo thought that Chijiiwa had left the burden of his ill daughter and grandson upon him. When three men from the House of Iyi came to Tsugumo's home with the body of Chijiiwa, the men indicated that Chijiiwa's life was meaningless due to his death by a sword of bamboo.  Shortly after this visit, Miho and her son died of sickness.  Tsugumo hunted down the men that visited him, and he cut off each of their ponytails.  He showed the ponytails to the clan elder to show that the honor of the House of Iyi meant nothing.  Disgusted by this display, the clan elder sent all of his men to attack Tsugumo.  He fought off many opponents, and destroyed many precious artifacts in the House of Iyi.  When he was about to perform harakiri, he was shot.  This action vividly portrayed that the House of Iyi, and possibly other houses, was corrupt and had no honor.  The disturbing ending showed all of the blood being cleaned up, and the false idols being restored and replaced.  The House of Iyi remained for many years after that isolated event.","

There's a feeling of satanism when the Ronin's want to see the harakiri to be performed. The storyline becomes so specific to where it can be compared to any religion or culture. Many cultures and religion can relate to sacrifice and revenge for the ones you love. The story plays out very well, it does get kind of confusing as to where the plot is going, but like i said it plays out very well. Whenever someone puts personal attachment to fellow human beings before any complex notions of loyalty or honor, the rule of any authorities, be it democratic or totalitarian, is threatened to its very core. Without the abstract symbols of the trappings of power, there can be no dedication, and no attachment.","

"Harakiri","penguinsstolemysanity","22 January 2004","The film Harakiri, directed by Masaki Kobayashi, is a tale of honor. However, involves a conflict of honor, between doing what is morally right and doing what is expected of you.  A person is unable to choose both of these in some circumstances, such as the ones brought forth in Harakiri.The tale of Harakiri begins on May 16, 1630 with a man named Hanshiro Tsugumo arriving at the gates of the House of Iyi, requesting a corner of the manor to commit hara-kiri, which is a form of suicide ritualized by the samurai.  After being asked if he knew another retainer of the Gishi House named Motome Chijiiwa, he responds that there were thousands of retainers and is the tale of a former samurai who arrived at their door.The story tells of him arriving at the House of Iyi, requesting a place to commit hara-kiri.  They, instead, tell him to bathe and change clothes, as he will be meeting with the head of household.  However, after changing and being cleaned up, he is instead told to change once more into the clothes of the hara-kiri ritual.  Even after finding out his blades are made of bamboo and his multiple requests for a few days' delay, they force him to commit the ritual with his flimsy blades.Hanshiro still makes the request to commit hara-kiri and they give him permission to do so.  Then, when it comes time to name his second, he names three people, all of which had claimed they were indisposed that day.  To take up some of the time, Hanshiro decides he will tell them his life story. Within his first few words, he has said that Motome is a lad of some acquaintance, which is a great understatement.Hanshiro worked for the House of Gishi until it's downfall, and then proceeded to do various jobs to keep food on the table for himself and his daughter, Miho.  After being propositioned by wealthy men to take his daughter as a concubine, he requests that Motome and Miho wed.  They do so and have a child named Kingo.The family does what they can for a while, until Miho comes down with the `red death', or tuberculosis.  She is confined and is unable to go anywhere. Little to her knowledge, she transfers the deadly disease onto young Kingo, who takes ill.  Motome rushes about to find work to earn money to take care of his wife and son, but finds nothing, as samurai are not allowed to have the normal jobs of citizens.Desperation takes over and Motome sells his blades for money to take care of Miho and Kingo, who are growing worse by the day.  Motome hears about samurai threatening hara-kiri at the doorsteps of other Houses and being offered jobs or pittance, so he leaves, as it is known, for the House of Iyi.  He returns much later, dead, brought back by some of the retainers of Iyi.Hanshiro then explains how he got revenge for Motome, and Miho and Kingo indirectly, by cutting the top knots off of the three most involved retainers of Iyi.  The three most involved with the hara-kiri of Motome Chijiiwa.  Then, a fierce battle rages between Hanshiro and the Iyi retainers.  Hanshiro Tsugumo is eventually struck down, but not without causing wounds to multiple samurai who were forced into battle.  The House of Iyi covers up the days events, hiding all of the destruction caused by the arrival of Hanshiro.","

"Harakiri","HydroX7","2 September 2021","Just like the sharp edges of shadows on a cloudless summer day, Harakiri is a beautiful play of surprising contrasts that will unravel, slowly, towards a realistic depiction of the frail human condition, while emphasizing the complete lack of honor in an apparently honorable society. The relaxing atmosphere created from early in the film, defined by the calm weather, smooth camera movements, and pleasant static shots will soon be overshadowed by inner tensions and profound feelings, creating a well-defined contrast that won't dissipate for almost the entire duration of the plot.Harakiri dives into the implications of sudden political landscape change. A change that profoundly affects its characters and more specifically the Samurai class. After endless conflicts, a widespread peace has established in the country. The Edo period has begun some 30 years ago and many samurais had become masterless. Without a master to serve they become Ronins, wanderers, struggling to persevere in a world they are not prepared for. While adapting to a new lifestyle, their moral code is slowly being exposed, shown for what it truly is.Self-deceiving and ignorant, the few samurais that still have a master, walk on a rigid and intricate political maze, distorting everlasting truths and morals for self-benefit and for appearances. Living in an age without any conflict or war, they struggle to sustain their image through questionable ethics, ignoring obvious truths or even worse, being completely blind to them.Trying to be true to himself, the main character is forced by the surroundings to progress, mature and eventually accept reality. He descends, resolute and decisive to bring forth an incredible catharsis by revealing with crystal clarity that the ""Thing, we all call samurai honor is ultimately a facade"", bringing ultimate judgement and showing how idealistic and relative honor can be.The word ""Honor"" is used 17 times within this movie, but not even once did it represent its true meaning.Everything unfolds supported by gorgeous aesthetic visuals fusing with an exceptionally well told story, complex characters and music that amplifies the tension to perfection. Japanese architecture never lacked in beauty, surprising with its minimalism, straight sharp lines and symmetry. Being well aware of this, Masaki Kobayashi made sure that every shot was perfectly composed and every element used to its full extent.Harakiri tells a story whose motifs have a deeply instilled permanence that will never become redundant as long as politics and pride continue to exist. It also recalls the frail human condition but it does it so well and with such sheer intensity and realism that it feels just like life itself in the end.","

3) the movie is a complete and utter disappointment overhyped by older audiences most likely (the seventh seal, apocalypse now fall into this category)
Fortunately, Harakiri belongs to the first category. The pace is a bit slow and parts of the plot predictable, which is typical for older movies, but not to the point to make the movie boring.

Before I saw this movie, I only knew that harakiri was a kind of suicide for the samurais to show their faith and I thought that it is more like a documentary talking about the harakiri. However, it was completely different as I thought. The main story took place in Edo period. At the beginning, Hanshiro Tsugumo, a ronin went to House of Iyi in order to commit harakiri. Then the movie basically told two stories. The main one is about Hanshiro Tsugumo, and the other one is about his son-in-law, Motome Chijiiwa. Both two stories told us about the bad situation of the ronins at that time period, and their reasons to commit harakiri. Movie ended with Hanshiro fighting against House of Iyi and then committing harakiri. The movie showed us how these ronins make their decisions with the contradictory between Bushido, the obligation of the samurai and the various aspects of humanity. For example, Motome sold his sword, which represented the soul of a samurai, in order to get some money for his family. When his son, Kingo got sick and there was no more money to get him a doctor, Motome, as a father decided to commit harakiri. Motome, he made the decision to abandon his obligation of a samurai in order to be a good husband, a good father and a good son-in-law. Harakiri is an excellent movie. It not only tells people stories about harakiri in Japanese culture, but also shows us how cruel and hard it is to choose the right obligation.","

"Harakiri","vincenttorchia","21 January 2013","The movie Harakiri I felt was a great movie that showed great courage and the true art of ancient Japanese traditions. This movie was all about the samurai and its traditions in being a true warrior. Japan was in turmoil at the time and no one had any money and the honor of a true samurai was tested. Many committed harakiri which means suicide because they had nothing left and they wanted to die as an honorable samurai. Motome a character in the film who was a samurai, asked to commit harakiri but for the wrong reasons according to the samurai tradition. Hanshiro Tsugumo the main character and another samurai of this film also asks to commit harakiri but turns in to something more than that. I was a bit disappointed during the movie because I read reviews of this movie that said it was action packed but rally there was really only two fight scenes in the whole movie. Most of the movie was Hanshiro talking to the counselor of the house of IYE. For people who don't like movies with long talking scenes I wouldn't recommend this for you. This movie also had some very bloody scenes that I felt disturbing. If bloody scenes are something you don't like than I wouldn't recommend it. Overall I liked the movie because it had a great story line and I got some background on some ancient Japanese traditions related to the samurai. The movie is in black and white and also in Japanese but don't let that shy you away from it because I think you could really gain a new perspective on films if you watch this movie.By: Vincent Torchia","

"Harakiri","giovonnibrooks","21 January 2013","Harakiri was a movie that my class watched as we were involved with Japanese literature. To be honest, I was expecting a nonstop action film; however, the movie was so much more than that. Harakiri used a genre of samurai honor to show Japanese politics and culture. The plot is about a samurai named Hanshiro Tsugumo begging to commit Harakiri (ritual suicide) in the house of Lord Iyi. There, he learns the House of Iyi's story of the fate of his son-in-law, Motome Chijiiwa a previous samurai who sought work or money through lies at the house of Iyi but was instead tragically forced to commit Harakiri with a bamboo sword after they realized his plan. As the movie progresses Hanshiro Tsugumo tells the tragic story of his son-in-law, and how he was forced to sell his real sword to support his sick wife and child. Tsugumo then seeks to send a clear message to the House of Iyi and to get revenge against the house. The plot perfectly fits in with the message of movie. The message within the movie is a huge and important one. The movie shows us the importance of honor in Japanese honor and shows us that suicide is honorable, which is completely different in our culture. The movie is perfectly delivered in its purpose of being created. The framework is remarkable and each frame allows the audience to narrow down on the characters and really get to know them. This movie was way better than I had anticipated.","

"Harakiri","joeconti17","27 January 2013","The idea of watching ""Harakiri"" appealed to me and when going through the process of watching this movie I experienced a roller coaster effect onto my emotions on how I felt about watching the movie and actually what the movie was about. When I heard about watching a movie in class I was very happy because every student loves hearing that they get to watch a movie. This is simply because you get to get away from a classroom environment and just relax and watch a movie. So going into the movie I was very enthusiastic about going to class to watch a movie for three days. When I sat in my seat and the movie starts you begin to feel a little aggravated. I began to feel aggravated because the movie was in black and white; also the movie was spoken in Japanese so I had to read the subtitle the whole movie. Once I got over that I began to actually ""read"" the text that portrayed in front of me. There was multiple times during the movie it gets a little slow but then picks up very quickly which makes this movie very likable. The emotion I felt after watching this movie was one I have never felt before. It was a feeling that was indescribable; it made you think about what you would do if you were in the situation of Hanshiro and Motome. These two samurai are victims of the artistic element that the author or director of this text was trying to portray. The idea was one of obligations in conflict. This is where a character is put into a situation where any choice he or she makes will still put him in some sort of predicament. My teacher said to the class before the movie started that, ""this will be the movie you will watch in one calendar year."" He in fact was right and I do agree it is the best movie that I have watched in a year.","

As his tale unfolds, the tension in the film can be felt as it grows and grows incredibly until it is nearly unbearable. When the tension breaks in the showdowns between our hero and the samurai of the house of Iyi, it is with a vitality that bursts from the screen. The ending is incredible, tying together all the themes in a bloodbath that offers no hope that this will not happen again. The selfish and cruel house of Iyi grows in stature and there seems to be no prospect of betterment for the honourable warriors. The film exposes the bushido code as a farse wherein the honourable are exploited by the selfish. Incredibly shot, written, acted, it is an astounding achievement by director Masaki Kobayashi. Go see it at your next opportunity.","

I feel like I would not do anything as far as committing suicide. Watching the movie in the beginning seemed confusing because it started off with a flashback Motome had, he was a person that previously wanted to die by Harakiri. Looking at the series of flashback, I began to learn a lot about him. Watching this movie made me see how painful things could have been if I were in their situation especially having to kill myself with a bamboo sword which is very difficult because the sword was basically plastic. Reason for this is because around this time some Samurais were poor and some didn't have masters so they sold their goods for money. As for Hanshiro Tsugumo, he sold his sword then replaced it with a bamboo sword and I learned that ""The sword is the soul of the Samurai"". This movie helped me appreciate my life as well as the traditions of ancient Japan. I think the best way to actually understand this story is by watching the movie itself. In my opinion I think reading the story would be far too difficult to understand. I think this is a great movie to watch because it gives some information about what happens in noble traditions of ancient Japan.","

Yet, when the lord's samurais returned the body of Motome Chijiiwa to his house, Hanshiro Tsugumo was clearly there with his daughter for all to see. This is a major goof in an otherwise excellent movie. The director should have arranged so he would not be at home at that moment. I rate it 6/10 because of this. The Criterion version is exquisite and the black and white close ups are of excellent quality. Samurais are known to have beyond reproach code of ethics, but this movie is telling you otherwise... The inhuman treatment of Motome, the back room manipulation to deal with Hanshiro Tsugumo is proof that feudal politics is as bad as politics of all ages.","

"Harakiri","gmsilvana2012","17 June 2014","This film left me thinking on the irrationality of many that have power. When on a position of power, we are inclined to keep it, to maintain the status quo and avoid its loss, or the loss of the tradition that justified that same power. Saito 's irrational rigidity speaks not so much about his control over the situation and the profound trust and loyalty he has on the symbols of his daimyos and of the bushido code, but on the fear of it disappearing. It is only when we fear for that disappearance and for the uncertainty of the future to come that we cling as much to the past and to the promises we made on the past, even when this may lead us to the extreme of irrationality and even inhumanity. Harakiri illustrates what most go through when faced to confront their beliefs and to question the legitimacy of what we swear is the ideal or best way of living/thinking/behaving; a lesson that can be applied in any situation especially if it involves a decision that, as in the film, will affect a third person directly. His inflexibility made me see his character as rather weak and stubborn, rather than loyal and centered.","

"Harakiri","Almanac123","18 June 2014","""Harakiri"" is about standing up to authority. Hanshiro is a Ronin who visits the Iyi clan because he needs an honorable place to commit suicide with a samurai sword. Already I'm captured by the dedication of Ronin who are willing to sacrifice their own life in the name of honor. Hanshiro learns that his son in law Motome had earlier committed Harakiri in the same room. Motome's reasons are emotionally understandable considering his young son was dying. No father should have to bury their own child. The film tackles the subject head on. Hanshiro is facing the same dilemma because it's his grandson and daughter who succumb to death. The film is very dramatic and suspenseful for tackling these kind of issues such as death, disease and suicide. These are things that anybody could go through and experience. It makes the film very relatable that these characters are not invincible but instead very human. The Iyi clan doesn't trust Hanshiro and a battle erupts when they learn the true circumstances of Hanshiro's visit. It's breathtaking battle sequence in which Hanshiro battles the entire samurai clan. It's one of the greatest fight scenes ever filmed. What helps make the sequence so powerful is that it's one man against several. Many people must feel the kind of emotions that Hanshiro must feel. The feeling of being an outsider and a loner. He also somebody who has nothing left. He has lost his family. He has nothing to lose by challenging the Iyi Clan. He's a character to be admired because he is able to defend himself for a long time against them. He eventually commits Harakiri even as the remaining samurai arrive to shoot him down. Imagine the strength of Hanshiro's character as the Samurai can not defeat him with their own swords. They must resort to guns. Hanshiro shows strength of character because he'd rather sacrifice himself rather than be killed by one of them. The film begins and ends with the image of samurai armor. At the beginning, the armor commands respect and honor just by the way it looks. By the end, the viewer has become disgusted by what the armor represents. It's a beautiful film with something to say about Japanese culture and everyone.","

But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own. Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" aka ""Seppuku"" is one of them. The film of rare power and humanism, of highest artistic achievements, profoundly moving, tragic like the best Shakespeare's plays, universal and timeless even if it takes place in the faraway country of 1630 [...] A Masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made, ""Harakiri"" deserves all its praise"" I think that Harakiri is one of the greatest pieces of drama ever written (the reference to Shakespeare is very appropriate). The drama unfolds slowly but with incredible force and ever-increasing tension. But besides involving us in the tragic fate of the characters, Kobayashi denounces the hypocrisy and corruption behind the so often idealized ""honor"" of the Samurai. And in doing so, he also reflects on modern-day Japan's society, where appearance is what matters, and cover-up is the solution to all the problems. In a similar vein, see also ""Rebellion"" aka ""Samurai Rebellion"" (1967), another great movie by Kobayashi.As a frequent reader of IMDb, I see lots of good movies rated with 10 stars. I would reserve that rating to just a handful of movies that are above even the great movies. Harakiri is one of them.","

While the authority being questioned in movies such as Godard's ""Breathless"" is mostly directed towards the rules of filming present at the time, the authority being dismissed here is obviously the one behind the Bushido code, held by Saito. The combat scenes seem authentic in a way that is almost comical--ignoring what they may look like ideally, the director is able to make us feel the adrenalin present within Hanshiro during the fight scenes. This comical use of real actions, along with the demystification of the Iyi clan leader, helps expose the viewer to the idealized values present during the Tokugawa era, which although questionable, have been believed by many.","

"Harakiri","emilylippman","18 June 2014","In ""Harakiri,"" director Kobayashi creates a compelling, beautifully shot jidaigeki that has proved to have timeless thematic relevance, even in the context of our modern American culture. The film chronicles Hanshiro, an unemployed ronin with no options left, as he approaches the Iyi Clan in hopes to, if nothing else, exact vengeance for his deceased family members and point out the cruel hypocrisy of the Bushido Code.As evidenced many times throughout the course of this masterful film, strict adherence to the Bushido Code is, ironically, dishonorable. Clearly, even Kobayashi realizes that the code itself is not inherently bad; however, the problem with such strict adherence to any set of rules is that it diminishes reason, logic, and, most importantly, basic humanity. Kobayashi demonstrates the ridiculousness of the Code by having Hanshiro turn out to be the character that most truly and honestly exemplifies the Code- he comes to the Iyi Clan on behalf of his family and, at the end, stays true to his word and commits seppuku. All in all, ""Harakiri"" is an artful, deeply meaningful film with much to say- truly a piece of cinematic history. I find it to be particularly relevant today, given modern socioeconomic issues like unemployment, both at home and abroad. Unfortunately, many individuals are left in a state of self-induced shame. However, Kobayashi's film urges individuals to consider the less-than-honorable outside forces that may have contributed to their plight. This film is important because it emphasizes that, even well intended governments, institutions, and other authorities become so wrapped up in themselves that they deny humanity, just as they did in the plot of ""Harakiri.""","

This film questions the rationality of following dogmatic practices when it results to unethical behavior. As the movie opens up with a narration from a book and closes in the same way, Kobayashi also questions the validity of history and the subjectivity of the truth.

Even though it is black-and-white film, cinematography is just beyond amazing.Gut is to Japanese cultural belief as the heart is to Western belief, Japanese thinks there are one's mind, will and courage in his/her abdomen and therefore seppuku is showing everything of one's self to others.The border line between how one acts and how one is perceived by others is very thin. Following Bushido code was like the meaning of life for samurais, but during the Tokugawa era, many of them became ronins and the meaning of Bushido decayed as well. Bushido became more like a hypocritical act to show to others but not a code to live upon. And Hanshiro visits Iyi clan to tell Bushido is just a facade.The story unfolds within several different frame stories by different perspectives. Motome, Hanshiro's son-in-law, is introduced first by Counselor Saito. Saito tells Hanshiro a story about Motome and is depicted as a coward, sham samurai. Then Motome is described by Hanshiro later in the film, and is described differently this time and how the audiences perceive Motome's character becomes different in every person. This reminded me of ""Rashomon"" (Kurosawa Akira, 1950) in that how a character is perceived differently in different stories and how differently a character is told by how the storyteller perceived him/her.The history is written by the survivors and nothing seems to be changed. However, Kobayashi brilliantly uses the same shot in the beginning and at the end of the film to show how audiences are affected by the story.","

Kobayashi's gives a horrifying display of assault on the samurai code. Nakadai plays a proud samurai fallen on hard times when his house is disbanded who displays almost superhuman effection when he is faced with defeat. A man filled with guilt, Tsugumo seeks to avenge the wrongful death of his son-in-law, Motome Chijiwa (Akira Ishihama). He marries his daughter off to this ronin, but they slip deeper and deeper into poverty, and eventually his son-in-law is forced to sell his swords and willing to attempt an act of desperation. Moteme Chijiwa asks to commit ritual suicide at the house of iyi, the estate of a powerful lord, in the hopes that he'll be given a small payoff to avoid the ritual suicide. Unfortunately the honor obsessed lord forces the desperate samurai to commit seppuku with his bamboo sword. Hanshiro Tsugumo comes to the estate asking to be allowed to commit seppuku and slowly relates his pathetic story. Here, Kobayashi ridicules the samurai system as absurd and inhuman. He falls back on false notions of ""honor"" and pride that sound good, but ultimately fall short when practiced in reality.Hanshiro requests that the clan's three best swordsmen act as his seconds for his act of seppuku, but they are nowhere to be found. He then reveals himself as the father-in-law of the tragic Motome and begins to exact his revenge. Arguably Kobayashi's masterpiece, this savage attack on the hypocrisy, cowardice, cruelty, and ultimate emptiness of the institution of the samurai warrior. It would certainly be enjoyed by fans of the samurai genre who prefer style, violence, a thoughtful story, and people who are interested in Japanese cinema.","

His son in law was made to do harakiri with a bamboo sticky while trying to save Hanshirō ill grandson that ultimately died. Hanshirō wanted justice to be brought upon on those who have offended his houshold. As a rōnin or warrior without a lord he has come to show the li clan what a honored samurai could do. The film revolves around the idea of honor and the essence of what a warrior is. I believe the directors choice to effortlessly connect this with the samurai armor introduced at the start of the film and end was perfect. The samurai armor represented the mirage of honor the li clan believed they had. Even at the end of the film Hanshirō a ronin had kept his honor and kept his promise to perform harakiri.

It is methodically paced, and creeps up on you, like the Mifune character does to the lordly samurai in the film. So expertly crafted it defies my trying to capsulize it. The beauty of Kobayashi's work is the basis in reality, his stories and characters are breathing portraits. The bad guys are not acting out of evil, but just working through their interpretation of honor. The good guys are not so perfect, they lie, cheat and set traps. The plot is almost Western in it's structure, a very easy film to follow, but a film that makes you feel educated and cultured. I was completely floored by the opening scene of ""Hara-Kiri."" It is still perhaps one of the three or four most influential pieces of cinema I have experienced. Remaining shocking for me, to this day. The fight in the windswept fields of grass is spectacular. Watch Samurai Rebellion, Kwaiden, and the Human Condition Series. Why Kobayashi isn't more written about I don't know. When I first saw this film I wrote a letter to the director, c/o the Japanese Directors Guild, it was returned months later, saying I had missed his passing away by three months. I highly recommend this picture.","

"Harakiri","ruiz_bolivar","14 June 2014","Karakiri is my favorite Japanese films. This film is full of excitement, suspense, and drama. What makes this film great is the way Masaki Kobayashi went about recording the film. For instance, Masaki Kobayashi had low camera angles, real weapons, and he recorded on real time. I felt, that was what made this film great. One of the things that I actually enjoy about this film is the way Masaki Kobayashi pitches hidden massages to this audience. He makes the audience question what they believe is actually right. He wants his audience to dig deeper and don't settle for what's being said or told. What I find most interesting is the development of Japanese films. Japanese films were relatively late in film making. Yet, they made amazing films in the late 1900s. Karakiri is one of them. This film is a must watch.","

"Harakiri","zumpano_elisa_c","18 June 2014","Harakiri is a very well composed movie with a precise and beautiful black and white cinematography and the great direction of Kobayashi makes the two hours and thirteen minutes movie barely feel long.The tale is set on the beginning of the Tokugawa Era (1615 - 1868) and it is a jidai geki (period films) Japanese film. The movie has a story being told within another story so you have to pay attention to not lose track on who is telling what. The narrator of the story is the Bushido code and it is a negative critique of when you follow anything without questioning it, you are being dogmatic. When the ronin (unemployed samurai) Hanshiro goes to the Iyi clan to ask to commit Harakiri he knows he is not going to leave the sacred space alive but he went there anyway to make Saito recognize that what he had done with Motome (Hanshiro's son-in-law) was a total lack of compassion. We can see in some specifics shots that Saito is affected by what Hanshiro is saying but he can not surrender to it or otherwise it would be catastrophic. Hanshiro is actually the only one who embodies the code because he questions it and he has a broader view of it.Interesting Trivia about the movie: the battle at the end is fought with real weapons.","

"Harakiri","henricproduction","17 June 2014","The movie is about following the holy bushido code. A code every samurai must follow to preserve his dignity towards the clan and family. The main story follows a samurai who has lost everything, and wants to commit seppuku ( the honorable way for a samurai to commit suicide). The plot then takes a dramatic twist, when the samurai step after step reveals why he came there. He is there to prove a message, that people do not have to follow the bushido code blindly. The ""top samurais"" don't even have the courage to follow it themselves, so why should others do it? It brings up several questions of how we sometimes follow orders blindly without thinking. It makes us think that every code, every order, is all made up by humans like you and me. It can easily be related to how North Korea is treating their people in a communist society. We know for fact that they are following orders, but for what good reason? We can easily see that following the presidents order has left the North part of Korean, considerably more poverty struck than the South.We need rebels in out society. People that are not afraid to stand up for their sake and other people. Without them, we will never change and never prove our thoughts right.","

"Harakiri","joeylohman","16 June 2014","Harakiri is an excellent film taking place at the beginning of the Tokugawa era, using both the art of storytelling and flashbacks to tell the story of a Ronin (unemployed samurai) named Hanshiro who is seeking a place to honorably commit Harakiri (The honorable way to commit suicide for a samurai that must be granted by a master). After his ""clan"" is destroyed he travels to the Iyi clan seeking homage. The unexpected turns in this film are extraordinary and make it some what humorous to viewers. The use of Stylization and realism during these flashbacks make them very believable yet unpredictable. I thought it was and excellent samurai film and would recommend anyone to see it.","

"Harakiri","santiago_jose_ivan","16 June 2014","Harakiri shows a quintessential patriarchal society. Everything is set up by men, run by men, and shows consequences because of this system of living. Without a doubt it was a man who produced the dogmatic bushido code. Multiple times throughout the film you can see the flimsy construction of patriarchy. A lone ronin showed the power of one against a patriarchy, a system which has done him, his family and countless others wrong. These systems are supposed to provide security. They failed to do this as the lone ronin took the top knots from their top three samurai. In samurai culture this is the equivalent to having your head cut off. The film as a whole can be seen as an analogy to governments and patriarchal society.","

His witty way of telling his story reinterprets leadership and honor. this film leaves you questioning how history is written and what it means to follow an honor code how far should it go till rules should be broken?","

The Bushido code is challenged, and the true morale code and way of Samurai life is challenged to the core. I was told that I would never forget my first time witnessing an act of Seppuku, when one commits Harakiri by disemboweling themselves with their samurai sword. So far, I haven't. The black and white film technology available at the time of this movies production is a crime against humanity. How I would have loved to seen the rich red colors of the samurai armor, and to visually see the lush green trees in the Iyi Clan courtyard, or the saged yellow grass starving for the suns rays or a drop of water during Hanshiro's duel with the master swordsman. The film is a work of art, and should be treated as such. Sightly harsh and startling audio coupled with dark images and a haunting story line make this film probably something you shouldn't watch alone in the dark.","

"Harakiri","blake-wands","18 June 2014","Harakiri is a masterfully constructed period drama by director Masaki Kobayashi. The film is expertly set up and provides the viewer with a thought provoking, entertaining two hours of both brilliant dialogue and suspenseful action. The film starts with the protagonist of the story, Tsugumo Hanshiro (Tatsuya Nakadai), as an out of work Samurai requesting to commit Harakiri (Seppuku) because he feels he wants to end his life honorably instead of poor and hungry. The counselor of the clan tells Hanshiro a story similar to what is happening now and the other samurai's grisly fate to deter him, but Hanshiro remains committed to his cause. The film is told through a series of stories, using flashbacks and narration to move the story along. Kobayashi effectively used the flashbacks and allows the viewer to easily follow the story line while jumping between different stories and timelines. While the acting of Hanshiro and the Counselor is of a higher tier than most, some of the supporting actors fall flat and leave much to be desired. For example, in the film, when Hanshiro is telling a story of his daughter and her husband, the characters end up being a little flat and not living up to their full potential. Their acting wasn't pivotal in the advancement of the story so it didn't deter the viewer's enjoyment of the film.Overall this film was deep and the viewer realized that both the protagonist and antagonist both have their own motivations. I found myself thinking about this film and the messages it conveyed long after I finished watching it. There are parallels that can be drawn with current events and even could cause you to reassess your own moral code. I highly recommend this well-written film.","

"Harakiri","heavenbreanna","17 June 2014","Harakiri is a great black and white film,the director Masaki Kobayashi gives an insightful look on the after life of a samurai. The story is based through a flashback so the viewer has to figure out who is telling the story which is very different technique but it draws the viewer in. The film is about a ronin which is an ex samurai however, because he is no longer successful and has no family left, he wants to commit seppuku which is the art of cutting in the gut. However, the way the film is structure the viewer sees what he has experience and how his experiences led up to him making this decision. Something that is very interesting is the actor perform his own stunts. The films end in this very organized combat that was actually used with real weapons and everyone was highly train on how and when to throw the weapons and what direction so that it appears very real. Overall, the movie is great and takes the viewer through the journey of a ronin's life.","

The scene where the samurai tried stabbing himself with the bamboo daggers didn't seem fun at all, and i think he got paid well for that scene. When the samurais got into a duel and got their tops cut of, it was a symbol of disrespect and pointed out a good point and correlated perfect to its cultural history. The fighting scene in the mountains was epic and it will remain a classic. The director made sure to dramatize the fight by having the actors step back after every sword swing. The fight took a bit longer than it should have, but I'm guessing no one wants to rush a duel .","

"Harakiri","rachelgirma","12 February 2014","Kobayashi's ""Harrakiri"" easily enthralls the viewer through the tale of a ronin named Hanshiro who enters the house of Iyi to commit harrakiri- This is a story full of plot-twists and ""aha"" moments that will leave you in awe. Harrakiri was slow-paced and slightly confusing in the beginning, but that was the beauty of it. As soon as I put the missing pieces together, I felt fully-connected to each character. There was such complexity and tension throughout the film, it was almost nauseating. In the beginning, we are shown the symbol of the Iyi clan- an empty suit of armor that embodies power and integrity; the essence of grandeur. It is Hanshiro's storytelling throughout the film that shows how counselor Saito of the Iyi Clan is completely dehumanized beyond reason. Counselor Saito refuses to have the clan exploited for money or clothes so he tells the tale of a ronin named Motome and his attempt to commit harrakiri with a bamboo sword. Hanshiro tells his side of the story: The heart-breaking story of Motome who did not have enough money to help his dying wife Miho and son Kingo. Counselor Saito knew he took it too far but he refused to acknowledge that he did anything wrong; he was simply following the code(the code is greater than life itself). Acknowledgement of such a thing could cause complete chaos and would make others question the validity of the bushido code and the Iyi Clan. Finally, once chaos had erupted in the house of Iyi, we are again shown the symbol of the Iyi Clan- an empty suit of armor exposed to be completely hollow and void of all honor it once held.","

For example, a scene is shown where a samurai's top knot is sliced off. This is one of the most dishonoring consequences that can happen to a Samurai, and according to tradition, seppuku should be committed. However, this does not occur and this demonstrates the hypocrisy of powerful individuals in said culture. Additionally, in the end when Hanshiro is fighting off the other samurais, this battle comes to an end as they bring out guns and gun power, ending his life that way.

"Harakiri","pandayew-921-531899","12 February 2014","Tradition vs. Humanism: the revaluation of dogmas and inevitability of progress Having participated in kendo, the art of Japanese swordsmanship, for a good decade, I am somewhat familiar with the importance of tradition and discipline within the samurai culture. Of course, the tradition has lessened in it's severity overtime, but we still respect and remember it's importance and time and place in the culture. Watching the movie ""Harakiri"" I couldn't help but question the dogmatism of the men of the Iyi clan. In the beginning of the movie I felt slightly delightful that Motome was being teased and tortured. I judged him without even thinking about his situation. Later, finding out more details of his personal life, I felt sorry and guilty for feeling almost enjoyment for his forced suicide. Passing judgment on Motome without even knowing or trying to know what he went through shows the audience that, we as a people, it is in our nature to take the point of view of those who are telling the story. This also makes a statement on how the history we know might not be true. It could be biased by the people who wrote it. This is proved at the end where Counselor Saito rewrites the history and covers up the incidents that occurred within the Iyi house. Professor and Director Salvador Carrasco states that, ""Meta history is what we get. We were privy to what happened even though Saito fabricates the history at the end."" Knowing that, how can we judge or even believe the facts of history that we know now?The discipline of the followers of the Bushido code shows how sometimes, exceptions of the code should be made for the greater good. Take Motome for example: he was a respected samurai but had to resort to selling his pride as one to save his family. If the Iyi clan had the decency, the humanism to respect Motome's request or even ask him why, things might have been different. But because of their headstrong attitude and pride to follow the code, Motome and his family are inevitably doomed. Through their dogmatic attitude and self-righteousness, they lacked humanism. It is in our human nature to become greedy, pompous, and abusive when we have power. When the three retainers of the Iyi clan call in sick for having had their top buns cut off, it shows that when power is taken away, so is their self-righteousness and pride.Also, In the beginning of the film, a contrasted shogun armor is shown. It represented power and something bigger but towards the end, it represented something else. Seeing the corruption and abuse of power, the fabrication of history, I can't help but see a meaningless, empty shell of a tradition that used to mean so much more. Overall, the human condition is constantly being questioned throughout the film. With it's print-like composition and symmetrical settings clean shots and simplicity,, the solemnity and seriousness of the film is exemplified.","

Be ready to read subtitles at the speed of light and pay attention because if you don't you run the risk of missing out on a whole lot of plot and information. The film starts out slow, following a ronin and his family as they struggle through hard times that include unemployment, sickness, loss and a little bit of love and selflessness to even everything out. At times it can be a little confusing but if you pay attention to the characters you'll have no problem putting together all the pieces of the puzzle. The theme of this movie is relatable across every culture. You feel for the characters and the situation they are in and when you find out that the family has sold everything of value they own, even the blades of Motome's swords, your heart aches for them because you know it still isn't enough. And finally for a nice spin at the end, history is rewritten and it will leave you questioning everything you've been told. An all around amazing story that is definitely worth watching.","

"Harakiri","brhmabul316","4 January 2004","The movie Harakiri and the story Beyond the Pale of Vengeance both examine justice, revenge, hypocrisy, integrity and the samurai code in the Japanese, samurai culture. In the movie Harakiri, justice and revenge are parallel to each other. The main scene begins when Motome commits Seppuku in the house of Iyi in the way he is forced to and show complete disrespect to Motome then later to Hanshiro Tsugumo when they deliver Motome's body to him.  This enrages Hanshiro and sets out so that justice will be served to the people had played a role in this cruel act that clearly had crossed the line. Hanshiro goes out to seek revenge on the members responsible for treating Motome as they did.  Hanshiro finds the three men most responsible and cuts off each one of their top-knots instead of killing them which in the Japanese culture having your top-knot is worse then being killed because it is an act of such dishonor.  Honor is the most coveted above anything else to these members of the House of Iyi so Hanshiro's act was the most extreme act of revenge that he could have done.  Hanshiro clearly got his revenge but if he crossed the line of justice and went to far is clearly is an opinion of the reader but I believe Hanshiro's revenge was completely justifiable.The House of Iyi showed the only definite act of hypocrisy.  The House of Iyi is built upon honor and order and throughout the movie they were extremely two-faced when it came to honor.  The way they disrespected Motome showed absolutely no honor at all and was proof that their `honor code' was very superficial.  An argument could be made that Motome as a samurai showed a little hypocrisy when he sold his swords for money.  The movie states that a samurai's blade is his soul.  I believe that act was more of an act of integrity then of hypocrisy.  Even in Japanese culture you are a human being before a samurai and the responsibilities of being a human being are greater then those of the samurai.  Motome needed to take care of his wife and child.  He tried desperately to find a job of some sort but could not and had to sell his swords as a last resort to make some kind of money for his family.  The House of Iyi tried to show this as an act of a coward but really it was an act of integrity and a hero. The samurai code is a conflicting subject throughout the movie, Harakiri. Between Motome selling away his swords and Hanshiro avenging the death of Motome because of the disrespect and the lack of a honorable samurai code by the House of Iyi it shows the number one priority in the samurai code is honoring and protecting family.","

"Harakiri","nataliejulia02","11 February 2014","I had never seen a Japanese film before I saw Harakiri. For an introduction to Japanese cinema, I was greatly impressed by Kobayashi's accomplishment in making this complex film look effortlessly simple. At first, I thought that this film would be a typical period piece just set in Japan but that was an ignorant assumption that I made. The film follows the story of two ronins (samurai), Motome and Hanshiro, during the Tokugawa era. They each, at separate times, ask to commit harakiri (suicide) at the Iyi clan house with similar background stories. Half way through the film, the story comes around that these two ronins are related. The film's plot not only symbolizes the end of the samurai way of life, but also presents a greater meaning of humanism vs dogmatism and the corruptive nature of power. The film makes us, the audience, aware of our own humanistic, dogmatic and corrupt traits by following Hanshiro's explanation to who he is and who Motome was. Although at first, we see Motome come to the Iyi clan to commit harakiri, we also see that he does everything in his power to save his family and what his intentions were originally, making him the most honorable of samurai. The Iyi clan persecute him due to regime than considering the reasoning for his suicide. The clan represents the dogmatic samurai that think with their heads rather than their hearts. This shows the corruptive nature of power and stagnation. The film brings to attention our own ignorant assumptions that make us draw parallels between our moral code and that of the samurai code. Stylistically it is beautifully composed with balance and precision. The plot is perfectly complex yet easily understood, reflecting Japanese tradition, as not to obscure the meaning. Every scene has a deep significance and every element has a symbolic value that truly makes this film one of the best I have ever seen.","

To me, it made me feel like I was actually in the movie. I also liked how director Kabayashi used a tatami shot in some scenes. This film taught me a lot about Japanese history.

"Harakiri","tlsobukwe","20 January 2004","Harakiri is a film with strong denunciations of the hypocrisy of bushido (the code of the samurai).  Harakiri is a film about a family struggling to survive during a time following the battle of Sekigahara, which broke the power of the warlords.  Daimyoâ?Ts were reduced to mere vassals.  Laying strict rules and orders.  For victors the new order was peaceful and prosperous.  For the losers it was grim and hopeless.  After clans were destroyed thousands of retainers became ronin (masterless samurai). Such was the case for this family.  It all really unfolds after Motome; an unemployed samurai is forced to commit harakiri before a feudal lord. As it turned out, Motome did not even have real swords, having pawned his real ones to help provide for his family and only had bamboo replicas. Making the conclusion that he must be a con, the clan forced him to kill himself in the most painful and horrid manner with his short bamboo sword and was not beheaded until he had disemboweled his whole stomach. Hanshiro returns seemingly to perform the same suicide ritual.  In an effort to discourage him from this duty he was about to perform he is told the story of Motome. Hanshiro listens to this story with a straight face, because as it turns out, Hanshiroâ?Ts daughter Miho had been married to Motome.  Who is unable to provide for his family and find employment. The family struggles Miho and her son become extremely sick.  Fed up Motome leaves with what he believes to be a solution to his problems muttering something about borrowing money and leaves promising to return.  In a last furious display of power, Hanshiro battles against not only the countless samurai but also the hypocrisy of the bushido. Beyond the Pale of Vengeance is a gripping novel of a Buddhist monk who undertakes a seemingly impossible task of digging a 400-yard underground tunnel to fulfill his spiritual purpose to help those travelers he had previously harmed.  It shows how, in the process of conversion, he also transforms the lives of others.  It shows how no matter what a person has done, including murder and robbery, you can turn your life around and can then commit yourself to selfless service because it is your nature to do so as was demonstrated in this novel. Harakiri and Beyond the Pale of Vengeance are stories that portray great deeds done by great men.  Justice and revenge are examined in Harakiri in the plight of Motome and Hanshiro.  Motome had gone down to the House of Iyi to commit harakiri hoping instead that he would be offered a pittance and sent home in order to support his family.  Unfortunately such wasnâ?Tt the case and he was forced to commit suicide.  However, Hanshiro out of revenge went to avenge the death of his murdered son-in-law performing a courageous last stand. Beyond the Pale of Vengeance shows honor, integrity, justice, and revenge. Ryokai followed the bushido towards the end by regaining his honor and integrity by building the tunnel that would save thousands of lives, the lives he once took through a life of crime.  It also is a tale of revenge and justice because although he had recommitted his life to do the right thing his past came back to haunt him.  Jitsunosuke, the son of his slain master, Saburobei, had been looking for over ten years to avenge the death of his father that Ryokai had once killed. These two stories are great depictions of great samurai.  They both show justice, revenge, and integrity respectively but get there and show it in two different ways that show all these points perfectly.","

"Harakiri","Diazz1994","11 February 2014","Do not Hurry up to judgeAfter the civil wars in Japan a lot of samurais lost their jobs and became ronins. Some ronins travleled across Japan looking for jobs and others decided to commit harakiri (when a samurai kills himself with his own sword)Hanshiro, a ronin, comes to the Iyi house and asks to commit sepuku. The counselor tells him a story about a ronin Motome that lied that he wanted to commit sepuku. He was caught and forced not only to commit it, but to do it with his bamboo sword. Hanshiro listens to the story and insists that his intentions are true. The ceremony begins and Hanshiro tells the other side of Motome's story...The movie is incredible! It holds your attention from the beginning to the very end. I loved the way Masaki Kobayashi makes the viewers totally change their opinions about the characters throughout the movie. For example, at first I didn't sympathize Motome. I thought he was a liar, a quitter and he didn't deserve to be a samurai (and so did the Iyi house), but when Hanshiro tells Motome's story I felt the opposite. I thought what a brave man, how much he loved his family, he even sold his sword (which is extremely important for a samurai; ""a sword is a samurai's soul""; and it is very important detail that Hanshiro didn't even think about selling his sword and he really regrets that).I loved how Kobayashi shows Hanshiro's revenge not buy killing those three samurai's, but buy embarrassing them, buy cutting off their topknots (for a samurai loosing his topknot in a battle is worse than death).The two characters that are very important in the movie are the counselor and Hikokuro. Hikokuro is this true, dogmatic samurai that implicitly follows the rules of the Bushido code (which in the end is actually a book of lies). He is tough, strong and disciplined. A lot of viewers thought that he was sadistic, because of the harakiri scene, but I don't think so. He was a real samurai, that believed and followed every word in the Bushido code, and he considered people who disobeyed the code disgusting and weak. That's why he hated Motome and that's why he respected Hanshiro. Saito, the counselor, is another strong character in ""Harakiri"". He is the opposite of Hikokuro. He is a samurai, but first of all he is a humanist. He definitely understands what Hanshiro was saying, and I'm sure he felt sorry for him and his family, and I think he really regrets what they did to Motome, but at the same time he is a counselor. He is the head, the leader of the Iyi house, and if he brakes down, than the whole house will go down. That is why he ordered to kill Hanshiro, he needed to protect the honor of the Iyi house.It is very important to watch the harakiri scene (yes, girls, it's pretty graphic, but try to do it). I loved the way Kobayashi contrasts the reactions of Hikokuro, that is angry and doesn't feel any sympathy watching Motome suffer, he didn't even strike of his head, he was waiting for Motome to finish the harakiri cross; and the counselor, who is absolutely shocked and terrified, but doesn't say a word, because he can't, he has to prove that everyone will be treated like this ""you come to commit harakiri, we will make sure you do it"".My favourite scene is when the counselor makes up a story that will be the official record of what happened. Kobayashi really showed that this book, these ideal rules for samurai's are simply nothing, just a bunch of lies. It's all about appearance, and in fact it's all useless, it's just the illusion of perfection. It really made me question a lot about our lives and especially our history. How many ""official"" records like these do we have? And are the rules and appearances really worth it, or it's all just an illusion of perfection?","

It makes a statement that opens up the the possibility to question what is the truth and what is made to look like the truth. A true tale that dives into the minds of men and their actions that define history. Harakiri also shows the beliefs of the samurai and the double standards they put upon people and the true hypocrisy of those in power and how they are abel to alter and manipulate events to their own accord. It is also the journey of one man's attempts for revenge and to redeem the honor of his family and to bring the unjust treatment of his family into the light. It is a movie that leaves you with the feeling of bewlilderment and the felling to question and wonder what rally is the truth and what is the fiction that people want us to believe.","

"Harakiri","aha_vp","21 June 2004","""In times of peace, the honored warrior is no longer in demand."" The Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 was the last major war for the samurai. When Ieyasu Tokugawa brought peace to Japan (by conquering all his enemies), the role of the samurai changed forever. Thousands of samurai lost their jobs and were forced to make a living off of the battle field. Many chose honorable suicide over a meager existence. The samurai's sword thusly became a symbol of past greatness and no longer afforded him elite status. The relatively few samurai who remained employed supposedly lived by the samurai code, but without ever having seen war. This movie takes place in 1630 with impoverished war-veteran Hanshiro (Tatsuya Nakadai) paying a visit to a local estate, where he seems bent on committing harakiri...","

However, the way Hara-kiri was perform it lead to cruelty and brutal for me. Motome, Hanshiro and the rest of samurai that live in Iyi clan followed the Bushido code which was pure, unique because it was their religion and believes. Also for those who were decided in heart to committed Hara-kiri, they believe it was an honor to die this way. In other hand, I choose to talk about Motome because the scene where he committed Hara-kiri was the most that make me believe on what was happening and the reason why they were doing those kind of rituals. This scene was so pragmatic, it even make me feel the pain Motomo was going trough till the end of his death","

How in society some will have a dogmatic view on certain laws that leave no room for a humanistic approach. This movie has also shown me that maybe not everyone, history or in the present, is not who they seem. There were good samurai out there who really were respectful and honorable and ones who weren't. That there is no shame in putting your dignity on the line for the people you love and protect. It made me feel as though there is still hope for a conscious/humanistic way of doing things, and that maybe there is still a chance as a society to behave as such. As a bonus I really loved the samurai duals because there was something respectful and honorable about them. The movie itself was great none the less.","

"Harakiri","mrja127","11 February 2014","This movie is absolutely amazing. This film gives us insight to the Tokugawa Era of Japan in a very interesting way. Masaki Kobayashi tells an amazing tale of the plight between maintaining samurai ideals and humanistic ethics, we see this through the literal interpretation of the samurai code (the Bushido code) throughout the movie. What really stuck out to me was how hell bent Hikokuro was to make Motome commit seppuku without the grace period, no one cared to hear the back story to understand why Motome needed this period, and when Hanshiro was able to articulate the story to Saito (the counselor) although Saito seemed to be very impacted by the story, he had to uphold the ideals of the Bushido Code even if it meant the harsh self- mutilation of Motome with the bamboo swords.Not only was Hikokuro hell bent on making Motome commit seppuku, but he made sure Motome used the bamboo swords. Hikokuro fills in as Motome's second (to deliver the final blow) but when Motome does not do a ""good enough"" job Hikokuro refuses to deliver the final blow, so Motome must bite his tongue off to kill himself. This is in all ways the most dogmatic interpretation of the Bushido code because he wants everything to do be done the ""samurai way"" when in fact he does not.Hikokuro is a great example of a double standard in this movie, he forces Motome to commit seppuku with the bamboo swords, but when it comes to his topknot getting cut off he postpones his own seppuku because he does not want to die quite yet.Lastly we see the Bushido code upheld with such divinity towards the end. Hanshiro kills some of the people at the mansion because he is ordered to be killed and when it comes to writing the account of their deaths, Saito says to say that they died of sickness to not tarnish the Bushido code.Overall this movie was very well made and i really enjoyed watching it. This movie gives us two very different ideas of the character Motome (from scum to honorable) in the beginning and end, which i think is an example of Kobayashi's film genius.",NA
"Harakiri","prins_terry_john","11 February 2014","""Harakiri"" is a revolutionary Kobayashi masterpiece set in the early days of the Tokugawa Era, when Japan experienced a time of relative peace and Samurai and Ronin alike felt a new wave of challenges that start off the battlefield. The story follows a particular Ronin (or ""Unemployed Samurai""), named ""Motome"", as he requests to commit Harakiri or ""Seppuku"", a Japanese form ritual suicide, in the valorous House of Iyi. Kobayashi demonstrates his creative power and pure ingenuity in Harakiri as the story unfolds and he raises questions about honor, the Bushido code, the human condition, Samurai, the concept of power and how it affects those who wield it, and Japan's own identity as it emerges from the ever changing world of the post World War II period. Unlike other films about Japan's past and the Samurai in mainstream cinema, Harakiri questions the views of the Samurai and how they may have acted throughout history. For example, although ""The Last Samurai"" was well received in Japan, some viewers such as Tomomi Katsuta felt its honorable portrayal of the Samurai was incompatible with contemporary views, and that Japanese views of the Samurai are different, stating ""Our image of Samurai is that they were more corrupt."" For example, Samurai were permitted to kill common folk on site if they so much as gave them a dirty or disrespectful look. ""Harakiri"" does away with the fairy tale portrayals of Samurai that we often see, reflecting more of who they were and how power can corrupt all.""Harakiri"" will not disappoint, and I was pleasantly surprised with how it is capable of reaching all audiences, not just domestic ones. The fact that Kobayashi questions the human condition and how people of all origins sometimes handle power, honor, and cultural traditions, makes ""Harakiri"" and instant classic for anyone who watches it.",NA
"Harakiri","aurbz","11 February 2014","Harakiri is one of my favorite films since I have seen it. The directing has a very elegant feel and in some parts it feels as if you were actually there. This is one of those films that slowly and unexpectedly unfolds as you watch it. I found myself switching my feelings about certain characters as the movie went on. In the beginning, you are kind of forced to feel a certain way but gradually after that, you start to learn and understand what is actually happening. In each scene you learn something new and after each scene you just want to keep watching more and more. At the end of the film you can't help to think about the way some people live and the extreme moral codes they live by. Not only that but how some things are kept unsaid just to retain some type of order within that culture. Things like that happen all the time. People cover up the truth and flaws so that the code can remain the same and that others will still follow it. You can only imagine the amount of information that hasn't been passed on throughout the centuries due to that kind of reasoning. Overall, I loved this movie and it kept me on my toes throughout. After you think you start to know the story better, you are fed more and more information which keeps the film interesting from start to finish. Definitely a must see!",NA
"Harakiri","coster_james_michael","13 February 2014","Harakiri is an astounding achievement as its influence can be seen in countless replications of its signature plot structure. The characters are slow to develop as their intentions and encounters take place in what feels like real-time over the course of flashbacks. Once their intention is learned, the film erupts with a bloody moral battle over the blindness caused by dogmatism and the corruption of power. What is so unique to Kobayashi's masterpiece is his ability to paint the main conflicting characters with enough humanity wherein you are not able to identify ""the good guy"" until near the ending of the film. Both are viewed in a sympathetic light with their own reasons for their actions being displayed as just and reasonable. This film will make you completely reevaluate your conception of samurai films.",NA
"Harakiri","annemariesnow","12 February 2014","It is fascinating to watch the narrative unfold in this Japanese period drama set during a time of relative peace when Samurai were not actively employed as warriors and so many were disenfranchised ""ronin"" seeking to eke out a living and a meaningful existence.Beautifully shot in black and white and masterfully showing Japanese restraint in its pacing, the film examines the Samurai Bushido (honor) code. But, as a proud ronin named Hanshiro recounts (often through flashbacks) his moving personal story to the Samurai of the House of Iyi, the story unfolds in unexpected ways and we get an opportunity to stare into the souls of those proud Samurai. We also get the opportunity to asses where true honor lies. Is it honorable to adhere to the expected rules and rituals, or is it more honorable to reassess the rules as times of change and to let go of rigidity to show compassion to fellow humans in need?",NA
"Harakiri","baichunhou","12 February 2014","Rectitude, courage, benevolence, respect, honesty, honor, and loyalty are the seven virtues of Bushido, the spirit that Japanese people value the most. What the counselor of the clan, Saito, did at the end of the movie clearly violates the samurai code because he tells his people to lie about what really happens under the roof of Li Clan. I can't help relating Saito's action to today's Japan's. According to the news, the Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, just visited Yasukuni Shrine where 14 of these Japanese Class-A war criminals are paid respects as heroes. In fact, Japanese Government has never admitted that it invaded China and other Asian countries during World War II. Also the government denies the fact that Japanese soldiers committed massacre in Nanking where about 300,000 people were brutally killed. What is the most terrifying and hurting thing is that that period of history is completely altered in some textbooks in Japan saying that Japan was fighting back because other parts of Asia was invading Japan. Personally speaking, I admire the culture of Samurai. And I have always considered the spirit presented by those honorable warriors symbolizes Japan and Yamato people. At the same time, I also believe in humanity. I don't think that any human-made rules can surpass the deep kindness endowed in every individual's heart, which is completely beyond nationality as well as ethnicity. If I ever had a chance to talk to Saito in the movie, I would say: ""Please correct the wrongdoing by first acknowledging it.""",NA
"Harakiri","orazarnegar","12 February 2014","This movie elegantly portrays how history is written by the victors. Kobayashi's soul and personality shine through in his depiction of his experience in the war. Kobayashi flips our emotions so thoroughly and effortlessly throughout the film.He starts and ends the movie with the same scene of a coat of armor, but our emotions and feelings toward the coat of armor couldn't be any more opposite. The way we view the armor in the beginning of the movie as opposed to the end is a great reflection on how we feel about the entire Iyi clan and almost a backwards parallel to how we feel about Motome as the story progresses. At the beginning of the movie we see the armor and it seems to have a life of its own. It's incredibly imposing and you feel as if it is magical or almost godlike and you're just watch, waiting for it to come to life or to see that there's actually someone inside. Though the movie ends with the same exact shot, because of all you have learned about the Iyi can, their symbol seems as hollow as they do. The armor just feels empty, lifeless, and fake. You take the armor for what it really is, a covering or a cloak with nothing behind it. It's interesting how our emotions travel in the opposite direction with regards to Motome. Prior to receiving Hanshiro's story, the audience feels the same way towards Motome and draws the same conclusions about him that the Iyi clan does. However, as Hanshiro's story continues, we slowly realize Motome's motivations for going to the clan. He may have initially had ulterior motives but we end up deeming his actions as justified and the actions of the Iyi clan dogmatic, ruthless, and unnecessary. We stop agreeing with the Iyi clan when we realize that Motome was just trying to provide for his sick son and wife. When Hanshiro points out all the hypocrisy and faults the clan has, Saito looks affected, but ultimately doesn't apologize or change his actions. Kobayashi's pacifistic personality shines through when we see that Hanshiro only took the top knots and not the lives of the samurais that orchestrated his godson's death. While this movie has been taken as an offence to some, I believe that Kobayashi showed what a true samurai was in his characterization of Hanshiro. This film didn't highlight",NA

The movie is really a flashback, but shows the series of events that unfolded in a very linear fashion.

The acting was played out very well with intensity in every character, as if most of their expressions could explain everything that was going on.

"Harakiri","robkurz35","12 February 2014","If you're a fan of Japanese culture, and especially if you're into feudal Japanese samurai stuff, than Hara-kiri is a great film for you to watch. It's a Japanese made film from the 60's so don't expect a huge Hollywood type of movie, but even without all of the glamour, it's a very interesting movie filled with symbolism, eastern philosophy, dogma, and really makes you question culture in general and the codes we live by today.I felt like the way Kobayashi filmed the movie made it very suspenseful. At almost every moment it feels like there is some kind of tension going on, and that includes the dialogue which seemed to be most of the movie. Even with that in mind I feel the way it was filmed made every moment in the movie fun to watch. The actors where pretty good as well, especially the facial expressions in the close up shots and the real life sword fighting.A movie that I personally felt that had some similarities to Hara-kiri but in a more modern version was Rambo. Both Rambo and Hanshirō were soldiers who were dogmatic in their military ideology and fantastic soldiers. When they came back to society when they needed it most, they were treated like washed up dogs because society didn't need them anymore. Even though they were the ones whom the system created in the first place.",NA

The images of the suit resembled fierceness, pride, and much honor that could be traced back to its ancestors who wore it.Kobayashi revolved around honor in his film giving me the chance to also question it . Distinctivley showing Hanshiro a true samurai who truly lived by honor something the Lyi clan was clearly lacking . The final scene of the film was what greatly spoke to me in which Hanshiro destroyed the grand red armor . This to me was the symbol for honor itself specifically in the Iyi clan . As when the Red armor went down and broke so did honor itself . When counselor Saito covered up the devastation and dishonor that was made in the Iyi house.I felt the armor lost its meaning, its definition of honor it had been shamed. Honor is something one cannot see but something one believes in almost like religion.

"Harakiri","carrie-finklea","13 February 2014","Hara-Kiri Directed by Masaki Kobayashi A courageous story about an unemployed samurai fighting for the honor of his son-in-law, daughter and grandson. The way the story unfolds keeps the audience in a constant state of gripping suspense. The story is weaved together from present-time to flashbacks that slowly (making it all the more suspenseful) reveal the true reason as to why Hanshiro wants to commit Hara-Kiri before the Lyi Clan.In this film, I especially loved the cinematography. As the camera silently glides through the grounds of the Lyi Clan, I felt as though I was a samurai. From the stealth-like camera movement, to the very clean and groomed framing of the actors and the background, to the quiet moments spent waiting for the Hon. Elder to respond to Hanshiro's declaration that, ""he is free to choose a second"" I felt as though I was a member of the Lyi Clan waiting for Hon. Elder to make his decision.I think Kobayashi's story of the samurai culture is extremely relatable to many issues we find in today's society. I found many parallels between Kobayashi's depiction of the samurai culture and religious institutions. For my purposes here, I will use Catholicism as an example. However, Catholicism/Christianity is far from the only religion one could find parallels.In Hara-kiri, the rigid samurai culture adheres to a strict code - the boshido code. However, the way these codes are appropriated leads to abuse of power and corruption. Kobayashi relays this message by focusing on one needle in the haystack - our protagonist Hanshiro. Through his experience, we understand the consequences of these appropriations on a personal level. We see how the samurai culture was full of exclusivity and allowed for their own people to live in poverty and starve to death in exchange for the preservation of their codes. Motome, Hanshiro's son-in-law, was forced to perform Hara-Kiri using a bamboo sword. He pleaded for a few more days before he committed suicide, but they would not listen. The event becomes even more tragic as we discover that the sword was bamboo because he sold the original to save his ailing wife and child.So how does all of this relate to Catholicism? Similar to the samurai culture's strict principles and ideals, Catholicism has a dogmatic, literal and archaic view point on homosexuality and abortion. The Catholic religion bans gay marriage and refuses to acknowledge, support, or accept homosexual relationships within the church. Recently, NPR did a report about a man who applied for a job in a Catholic school. He met all of the credentials, and they were so pleased with his interview he was hired. However, when he filled out his paperwork, he revealed his husband as a significant other. He was quickly informed he no longer could be employed, because they did not condone gay marriage. And what was the position he applied for, you ask? He applied to be a cook! This story is littered with hypocrisy, judgment, exclusivity, and discrimination. In their determination to preserve these archaic beliefs, they have exemplified hate. Or the fact that Catholic gay couples are having to worship in a separate church. What the church fails to realize is that in order to preserve their doctrine's literal meaning, they are violating the core values that are the foundation of their religion.In the end of Hara-Kiri, Saito tells a member of the Lyi Clan the story of what will end up in their history books. He does not want his Clan shamed by the incidents that have just happened. Ultimately, despite honesty being the core value of the boshido code and samurai culture, Saito breaks it to preserve the reputation and power of the Lyi Clan.This is very similar to the current scandals we see today in the Catholic religion. A multitude of sexual molestation cases of young boys by their Catholic priests have occurred. What makes the incidents even worse is the churches knowledge of the scandal and its attempts to cover it up (transferring the priest, bribery,denial). And just like Saito, they too violate one of the core values of their institution - truth.I went to a museum exhibit in which there were letters encased in glass from young women writing to their local government and religious institutions. They were pleading for a way out. These women were trapped with an unwanted pregnancy and stranded without any options. I remember one woman's tearful letter as she begged for her governor to grant her permission to have an abortion. If her school found out she was pregnant, she would be kicked out of nursing school. She was the first in her family to go to school and her father would disown her if he found out.Again, another example of how religion has violated their ethical code in order to preserve the sanctity of their institution. Instead of helping these women and looking beyond the text, they left them stranded and forced them to follow through with their unfortunate predicament alone. This is exactly what happened to Motome when he went to the Lyi Clan to plead for money for his dying family.",NA
"Harakiri","addington_ronald_kel","13 February 2014","I cannot stress how perfect this film is. From the style, the deft direction, to the moral yet humanistic storyline, this is as perfect as a film can get. Harakiri, in one word, is a masterpiece of cinema.We are told a tale of set in post-Tokugawa Japan, where samurai are, for the most par, ronin (without a master), and who are struggling to find meaning and employment when their way of life is upended and their services are no longer needed. These are men who are facing a new world, and most importantly, trying to maintain their dignity in the face of such change. The story starts as the protagonist, Hanshiro, enters the Iyi house to request a place to commit seppuku – the traditional samurai suicide/self-sacrifice. He is greeted by Saito, the counselor, who wants to ensure that Hanshiro is fully aware of his choice and that he is committed to fulfilling his stated desire, as there have been a number of samurai without homes and employment who were simply looking for a hand-out or pity, and therefore, new lives within the Iyi house. After telling of a recent event involving Motome, we are set up for a revealing, unexpected and devastating middle and final act. Without revealing the remaining story, what I will focus on is how the beauty of this film is achieved through the simple yet engaging story. This is a film about samurai, but more so it is a film about how dogma and rigidity is destructive once people choose the status quo and institutional boundaries over humanity and compassion. We are asked to question when and why certain beliefs should give way to mercy, and how a lack of mercy turns such honorable views and institutions into harsh and hypocritical systems that lack understanding and self- reflection/introspection. Like all great films, the story goes beyond what is portrayed and is an indictment of human institutions and societal guidelines. You aren't left simply questioning the actions of the samurai, but rather questioning one's own morals and value systems.",NA
"Harakiri","Azra666","16 February 2014","The year is 1630. The Tokugawa are ruling and have brought with them a time of peace and tranquility. However,this new peaceful society came at the expense of the Samurai Class, the warrior sect in Japan. As it was a time of peace, violence and battles were hardly a matter of importance and this resulted in the unemployment of the Samurai Class. The Ronin were struggling to make end meet as their feudal lords either went broke or abandoned them.Hara Kiri directed by the great Masaki Kobayashi portrays the story of Ronin Hanshiro and his son-in-law Motome. Told in a complex chronological order, as the movie switches between narrators and flashbacks, the movie shines light on the set of codes that the samurai live by, the Bushido Codes. It forces the audience to take a side on the ethics, or lack thereof depending on your stand on the matter, of the Bushido Codes. Kobayashi did a brilliant job portraying the protagonist, Hanshiro as sensitive and well,a heartbroken samurai who decides to perform Seppuku (the act of a samurai stabbing himself with his own sword driving said sword across and upward his torso) in the yard of the Iyi Clan. As revolting as this may sound, dying in this manner was seen as honorable and a privilege. He utilized Hanshiro's emotional weakness and his warrior strength to question the ethics of the Bushido code in a elegant manner. Hanshiro's uses his anger as a carefully honed weapon to avenge his family and I didn't even see it coming. The plot was taut with suspense and curiosity until Kobayashi introduces Counselor Saito, the head of the Iyi Clan. Character development is evident in each and every character in the movie and contributes to the theme in the movie: the corruption of the authority. Power.Greed. The misinterpretation of honor. The misinterpretation of the Bushido Codes. The story of Motome and Hanshiro is told in a way that forces the audience to change their perspective. In a way, the audience, is also going through character development,as our opinions of the characters change drastically at various stages in the movie.What we may have assumed may tell more about us than the characters. That's what I loved most about the movie, how we are able to make judgments without a moment pause, how it may not even make sense or follow any logic, but we still make assumptions about someone and their life.This was a great samurai movie, not your usual martial arts extravaganza, though the Boss Fight at the end was glorious in its close-ups and dramatic performance. Honestly, it's quite hard to forget, as the characters leave a mark on you and the theme will leave you questioning history and what makes true honor.",NA

When I saw Hanshiro still had sword while Motome sold his sword for his family, I was very disappointed on the other hand I kind of understand what was going on. Hanshiro is a man who would have sold his sword for his grandson's life. I mean who wouldn't do that. But thinking of selling his sword just did not crossed his mind.

This cliché is growing so much that now the customs produced anonymously by people are facing humanity, just like the giant you created. Tatsuya's superb acting also adds to this. The movie reflects its period exactly, you feel like you are somewhere there. It reflects families and their customs very well. My advice to you is to be careful about Harakiri, because even saying you will do Harakiri is a crime. You will understand what I said last time when you watch the movie. Be sure to watch it, applause.",NA
"Harakiri","skpboy007","28 December 2002","Spoilers!! The main focus in Masaki Kobayashi's Hara Kiri is the honor and virtue that one man or one house holds.  The entire movie and story told by Hanshiro Tsugumo is about restoring honor that was lost when Motome Chijiiwa threatened Hara Kiri and was forced to hold true to his word.  Chijiiwa, as the viewer learns from Tsugumo's story, was poor and married to Tsugumo's wife.  They had a child, Kingo, who fell ill.  Chijiiwa was driven to sell his samurai blades in order to provide for his wife and child.  Once he was out of options, he traveled to the house of Iyi and threatened Hara Kiri with the hopes that they would give him money, food, or a job.  They lead Chijiiwa to believe that they would furnish him with a job, since Japan was at peace and he was out of work.  Instead, they forced him to commit Hara Kiri with his bamboo blades.  The samurai from the house of Iyi brought Chijiiwa's body back to Tsugumo and Miho, Chijiiwa's wife.  They insulted Chijiiwa and said that he was a coward and had no honor.  In actuality, the viewer knows this to be false.  Chijiiwa, at first, tried to run away from the ritual. Once he was cornered and forced, he pleaded for one day leave. He wanted this in order to tell Miho and Tsugumo.  He had promised them of his return that evening he left and had to hold true to his word.  He was not permitted leave and was forced to commit the ritual with bamboo blades and an unsympathetic second named Omodaka. Once Tsugumo finishes his story of the previous events leading to himself requesting Hara Kiri, the samurai from the house of Iyi fight Tsugumo and the outcome of the fight is a Pyrrhic victory for the house.  He killed and injured many samurai at the cost of his own life and revealing that the house of Iyi has no honor.  Further shunning the house, he announces that the reason the three best samurai are not present is that they are cowards. They have requested leave in order for their top knot to grow back. Tsugumo, facing all three, single handedly cut off and shamed Yazaki, Kawabe, and Omodaka.  Omodaka committed Hara Kiri the previous night but the other two had not.  Lord Benesuki ordered that they commit it immediately and ordered for every death to be accounted for as a death via illness. He did this, along with restoring the entire house that had been destroyed by Tsugumo, to cover up the fact that his house was inferior to the samurai from the former house of Geishu.  Also, it revealed the little virtue Lord Benesuki has.  He stooped so low as to cover up the entire string of events and act like they never happened.  Tsugumo successfully restored honor to Chijiiwa and the house of Geishu.  Although they samurai did not want to admit it openly, they all knew that the better warrior had been Tsugumo and Chijiiwa proved his honor by committing Hara Kiri in the most vulgar style, with bamboo blades.",NA
