"noralee","16 September 2005","I saw Harakiri (Seppuku) in a new 35 mm print at NYC's Film Forum. This is a brilliant use of a narrow period genre to explosively indict politics and culture. Writers Shinobu Hashimoto and Yasuhiko Takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by ""The Count of Monte Cristo,"" Ambrose Bierce and Howard Hawks' Westerns as much as by samurai literature and movies.The film begins deceptively as a story within a story, seemingly providing a traditional example of upholding samurai honor, such as in the conventional, oft-retold tale of ""The 47 Ronin."" The context is set at a time when the central government, the shogunate, is supplanting local clans and arbitrarily unemploying thousands of people, notably their samurai, forcing them into the mercenary mode of ronin at best and begging for food at worse. But the parallels to the 20th century are made repeatedly explicit as the samurai who comes to this clan seeking help is from Hiroshima.Very gradually we get further insight on the tale within a tale, as we see more flashbacks within flashbacks into what each character has been doing before these confrontations and we get uneasy inklings that the moral of the story may not be what it appears at first and the stakes get higher and higher with almost unbearable tension.It is almost halfway through the film until we see a female and we suddenly see an alternative model of masculinity, where a priority is put on family, support, education and creative productivity. In comparison to the macho opening relationships, with their emphasis on formal militaristic loyalty to a hierarchy, a loving husband and father is practically a metrosexual. Seeing the same stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds to his grandbaby puts the earlier, ritualized scenes in sharp relief, particularly the recurring image of the clan's armor which seems less and less imposing and is finally destroyed as an empty symbol.The psychological tension in the confrontations in the last third of the film is more excruciating than the actual violence. Even when we thought we already knew the outcome from the flashbacks, the layers of perception of relationships and personalities are agonizingly peeled away with each thrust of a sword to reveal the depths of the horrifying hypocrisy of the political and social structure. And those are just the overwhelming cultural resonances that a 21st century American can glean. Like ""Downfall (Der Untergang),"" it reveals the inhumane mentality that led to World War II.The repeating motif of long walks then confrontations down empty corridors emphasizes the stultifying bureaucratic maze that entraps the characters. The revenge motifs are accented by startlingly beautiful cinematography that recalls traditional Japanese art, including drops of blood like first snow flakes then a waterfall.The over all effect of this masterpiece is emotionally draining.","

"Galina_movie_fan","21 March 2007","I've said it once about another movie, incidentally by the other great Japanese director as well and I want to repeat my words in regard to ""Harakiri"": ""There are good, very good, and even great movies. But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own"". Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" aka ""Seppuku"" is one of them. The film of rare power and humanism, of highest artistic achievements, profoundly moving, tragic like the best Shakespeare's plays, universal and timeless even if it takes place in the faraway country of 1630, by the words of one of the reviewers ""Harakiri"" ""is to cinema as the Sistine Chapel is to painting. Unsurpassable!"" The film grabbed me from the very first shot, from its opening credits with their perfect harmony of kanji (I believe it is a correct word to describe the writings) characters, with the unusual disturbing score and with the dark beauty of the images. And then the story begins that centers on Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai), one of hundreds or maybe even thousands unemployed lord less samurais, ronin, that in the blessed times of peace had not many choices to adjust to new life and often preferred to commit a ritual suicide, hara-kiri or seppuku on the property of the wealthy estate owners. According to Bushido, the way of the samurai, ""One who is a samurai must before all things keep constantly in mind, by day and by night . . . the fact that he has to die. That is his chief business."" At the same time, samurai and anti-samurai film, ""Harakiri"" offers the masterfully screened scenes of sword-fights, not plentiful but exquisitely choreographed, perfectly paced and unbearably intense but the film is much more than that. It is also a gripping court drama where the truth is unfolded in the flashbacks. The viewers are allowed to look closer at the noble Samurai code of behavior and to reflect on how its abuse impacts the fate of an individual and the society in general. Compelling, poetic, and tragic, the movie has one of the most pessimistic endings ever that makes you wonder how the history is made, how the historical events are interpreted and who decides what would be written in the chronicles and important documents and what would be left out.A Masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made, ""Harakiri"" deserves all its praise. It is not in my nature to force my opinion on anyone but if you call yourself a movie buff or a movie lover, you MUST see this film.","

"Sleepin_Dragon","28 December 2022","The story of a Samurai, who requests to commit harakiri.I have read many of the reviews with a great deal of respect, many have such an understanding of the culture, and a very deep understanding of the content of the film, for my ignorance I come here as a novice, with no understanding, so from my viewpoint, I'm watching a film I've been told I'd love. I've seen one samurai film prior to this.First off, I had to check it was actually made in 1962, it felt way more advanced than that, the concepts and production.I thoroughly engaged with it, the story was fascinating, and where I expected it to tell a general story, the focus was pretty much on one single character, Hanshiro Tsugumo.Some of the pacing me be hard for some, the long drawn out scenes, I find very purposeful. The music is engaging, the acting terrific.I wasn't surprised to learn that the swords and multitude of blades used in this movie were real, and that I think is one of the film's most successfully aspects, its authentic, a story presented in a very real fashion.It's a powerful story, 9/10.","

"frankde-jong","12 June 2020","The generation that came after the renown Japanese directors Kurosawa, Ozu and Mizoguchi is generally regarded as less talented. The main representatives of this generation are Kaneto Shindo, Kon Ichikawa en Masaki Kobayshi. Personally I would like to make an exception for Masaki Kobayashi, who is in my opinion the equal of Kurosawa, Ozu and Muzoguchi.Kobayashi is best known in the West for his ghost stories ""Kwaidan"" (1964). The rest of his repertoire, among which the samurai movie ""Harakiri"" (1962), is not to be sneezed at either.A samurai movie is usually seen as a sort of Western of the East. Main ingredients of the Western genre are action and the battle beween the law (good) and the villains (bad).In ""Harakiri"" (which literal translation is: hara = belly , kiri = cutting) in stead of the law there is the samurai code of honor (Bushido in Japanese). But this code of honor is not the good element of the film. Rather it is revealed as a force of ruthlessness and hypocrisy. In the film the Bushido is represented by the Li clan.In ""Harakiri"" there is also little action. Only towards the end there is something that can be seen as a ""shoot out"". But in this shoot out the evil is not overcome, but only revealed as shallow (the idol of the Li clan is shown to be an empty armor).Translated in Western movie genres ""Harakiri"" is therefore no Western. Maybe it can be categorised as a Court room drama. The heart of the film consists of main character Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) telling his sad story. This story is in essence a requisitor against the Bushido. The performance of Nakadai as a broken Tsugumo is brilliant. His requisitor is not only aimed at the Li clan, but also against his own past. Once Tsugumo also was a samurai.Kobayashi was a convinced humanist all his life. Apart from ""Harakiri"" he also made the 9,5 hours epos ""The human condition"" (1959-1961). This epos is situated in World War II. For Kobayashi kamikaze was just another form of Harakiri and thus just another utterance of the old Bushido.","

"OttoVonB","7 October 2005","Having seen this film the mind becomes clouded with the innumerable things to say about it. Only praise comes to mind. Kobayashi has crafted The great samurai film for the rebel generation and he mixes a deftly handled criticism of authoritarian hypocrisy with a very touching piece of human drama.The plot is deceptively simple: an old samurai (touchingly portrayed by Tatsuya Nakadai of ""Ran"", ""Kagemusha"" and ""Sword of Doom"") arrives at a clan castle to commit seppuku in their yard, and then tells his tale, seemingly trying to gain time at first. What seems to be the rambling of an old man soon turns out to be a grieving account of how this man (and, more significantly, his loved ones) was wronged by the clan. Then comes the violent revenge (this is where you think ""Wild Bunch with katanas"", though they do up the ante toward the end with guns...).Kobayashi's direction is masterful, keeping an unbearable suspense during the mostly talky film, handling the touching scenes with care and maturity and giving us a sweeping fight to top all that. The 133 minutes running time never feels half that long! At the heart of it all though, is Nakadai, who, despite an excellent CV, delivers his greatest performance ever. His Tsugumo evokes a wounded panther, grieving an grieving until it gives in to fury. Nakadai's performance alone marks the film as essential viewing.If you're open to samurai flicks, this will rank among the finest films you've ever seen.","

"futures-1","17 July 2005","""Harakiri"" (""Seppuku"") (Japanese, 1962): It is the 17th century. A young Samurai warrior arrives at a mansion, asking to perform his ritual death there. In a series of flashbacks, we learn who he is, why he came, and what has occurred since. Although quietly told by another ex-warrior (about whom we also learn more), this is an interesting story that builds in complexity and tension. Debates about rituals and appearances may at first seem to hold more significance in old Japan than in the contemporary United States, but it is not difficult to translate and implement such thoughts. Love, honor, duty, family, children, saving ""face"", determination, desperationthey all exist in OUR everyday lives. Dramatically photographed in beautiful black & white, given a strong Japanese score, and paced so that even the mildly patient will be glad they saw it, ""Harakiri"" is epically huge, and a must-see for story & film lovers.","

"Duree","8 November 2001","This film is the purest distillation of the spirit of Greek tragedy ever put on celluloid.  Yes, this is a review of Seppuku, a Japanese film released in 1962.  Perhaps it took a non-Westerner, free of all of the cultural baggage and ridiculous associations, to see straight into the heart of the tragic mode and make it palpable and alive in the twentieth century.  That is not all: the black and white cinematography is both formally assured and often outrageously daring; the soundtrack is one of the finest efforts of the greatest Japanese composer of the 20th century (or any century for that matter); the acting is demonically inspired; and the narrative is relentlessly gripping and involving.  The film illuminates the relationship between the individual and society and between society and history.  It is a tender meditation on familial love and the ties of friendship that transcend even death.  This film will cut open your bowels, pull your soul out, and force you to stare it in the face.  There may be other films that attain similar heights, but I cannot imagine any film, ever, being more perfect. Forget Citizen Kane, Seven Samurai, the Godfather, etc. etc. all of those commodified canonical works that everybody raves about because everybody else is raving about them.  Don't get me wrong, they're fine--but this stuff is 200 proof.  See it today.  Buy it yesterday.","

"lstrawser","13 April 2006","Harakiri is an excellent human drama set in feudal Japan that involves a ronin presenting himself to a powerful clan and asking to commit harikiri. However, through a series of flashbacks we see that this ronin is motivated by more than the idea of dying honorably. The events that follow are a critique of the feudal system and a celebration of dying for one's beliefs.Every frame in Harikiri is wonderfully composed and a treat to view. The cinematography is crisp, the sets wonderful and the actors are spectacular. Much can be said about this film's technical merits as well as its social implications. I found out about this film through my love of Akira Kurosawa's samurai dramas (who else...) and I must say that it is very different from Kurosawa-sans work although it draws inevitable comparisons. Due to its themes, Harikiri is more of an anti samurai film. Generally Kurosawa's work seems to glorify the honor of the samurai and celebrate them as Japanese heroes by showing them gloriously in battle. Kurosawa is the Japanese John Ford, taking an icon from his culture and celebrating it. Harikiri exposes the virtues that Kurosawa portrays as being ""a facade"" to directly quote the film.I say this so as not to mislead any potential viewers, I do not know enough about Japanese history to judge what the samurai really stood for and really I am not concerned with the idea. This is the only Kobyashi film I have seen and it has been brought to my attention that many of his films deal with similar themes. All in all I think that Harikiri is a wonderful film that offers a new take on feudal Japan.","

"jonsefcik","17 February 2019","Seven Samurai is pretty great, but I think Harakiri is even better. This tale of a ronin seeking revenge and exposing the flawed samurai code is so close to perfection. The story is engrossing and despite the slow pacing it's never boring. What the production lacks in scale it makes up for with emotional intensity. The sparse, ominous score is perfect for this film. The direction and cinematography are masterful and the camera's slow pans and zooms really butter my croissant. The editing is great and purposeful too. There's not a single weak performance but Tatsuya Nakadai in the leading role steals the show.My only complaints are with some of the pacing and fight choreography. There's a standoff scene in the middle that could have been cut (since it felt like a cheap way to build tension and it wouldn't make sense for them to continue waiting afterward) and the long flashback could have also been trimmed. The film is 2 hours 13 minutes but I think exactly 2 hours would have been perfect. From a fight choreography standpoint the one-on-one fight scenes were well done but climax was shaky. There were many interesting ideas and moments in there, but also several points where I was like ""okay, how did they not strike him there?""Harakiri is an outstanding film that deserves more attention. If you haven't seen this film check it out. The Criterion restoration is absolutely beautiful. I intentionally kept this review vague since it's best to go into it knowing as little as possible. With a few thousand more ratings, this film would be pretty high up on the IMDb Top 250, and I'd be delighted to see it there.","

"claudio_carvalho","3 February 2012","In 1630, after a long period of peace in Japan after the end of the clans, thousand of samurais do not have masters and are living in absolute poverty. The ronin Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) and former samurai of Lord of Geishu arrives at the house of Lord Lyi requesting a spot to commit hara-kiri (an honorable form of suicide through self-inflicted disembowelment followed by decapitation under the samurai code).Tsugumo is received by Umenosuke Kawabe (Yoshirô Aoki), who tells the story of the young samurai Motome Chijiiwa (Akira Ishihama) that arrived at the house also asking for a place to commit hara-kiri but expecting to receive coins instead. The warrior Hikokuro Omodaka (Tetsurô Tanba) convinces the clan to force Chijiiwa to really commit suicide using his bamboo blade as an example to other samurais that would appear using the same pretext to receive coins from the master.Tsugumo discloses that the lad Chijiiwa was his son-in-law that was forced to the situation expecting to raise some money to treat his sick wife and baby son. Further, Tsugumo had arrives in the house expecting to die not committing suicide, but revenging Chijiiwa, his daughter and his grandson.""Harakiri"" is a heartbreaking and tragic story of poverty and revenge in a period when Japan was ruled by the Tokugawa clan and thousand of samurais lost their work with the fall of the clans. This film is a little masterpiece based on the wealthy history and culture of Japan and the screenplay uses flashbacks and gives an explanation of this period of story for those that do not have a minimum knowledge of the history of Japan. The Internet is a useful tool to understand the big picture of this historical moment.The acting is top-notch and the cinematography in black and white is magnificent. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): Not Available","

"tintin-23","9 September 2006","It would seem impossible that any ""samurai"" movie could surpass Kurosawa's ""Ran,"" ""Kagemusha,"" or even ""Rashomon"" in visual impact, masterful storytelling, and moral imperative. However, there is such a film, and it is ""Seppuku"" (""Harakiri""), produced in 1962, arguably the best samurai movie ever made.""Harakiri"" (1962), as it is known in the West, was directed by one of the post-WWII great filmmakers of Japan, Masaki Kobayashi. This film, considered by many as his masterpiece, won him the International Jury Prize at Cannes in 1965. Unfortunately, Kabayashi is not as well known outside Japan as some other giants of the Japanese cinema. He was very much affected by the war, and his films, contrary to most Japanese filmmakers of the post-war eras, are very political in nature. Kobayashi's films explore the dark side of the Japanese culture, with its wars, corruption, and hypocrisy, and their consequences. His film, ""The Thick-Walled Room"" (1953), won him the 1956 Peace Culture Prize. His nine-hour trilogy, ""The Human Condition"" (1959/61), won the International Jury Prize at Cannes 1963, which actually launched his public recognition, presents a scathing critique of the horrors of WWII, experienced first-hand while on the Manchurian front, and later on the Ryukyu Islands. While serving, as a statement of dissent against war, he refused any promotion and remained a private until he was taken prisoner by the U.S. He spent one year in a prison camp before returning to the business of film making, in 1946, until 1952 as an assistant director under Keisuke Kinishita.In Japan, Seppuku is the formal term for ritual suicide by disembowelment. Harakiri, as it is known in the West, is the common term, which literally means ""stomach cutting."" It was an integral part of bushido, the code of conduct of the samurai warrior class. Seppuku was ordered by a superior as punishment to redeem some offence, or chosen over a dishonorable death at the hands of an enemy. In both cases, it demonstrated the honor, courage, loyalty, and high moral character of the individual. Except when performed on a battlefield, it was a very formal ceremony, requiring certain etiquette, witnesses and considerable preparation.Harakiri is a particularly painful and rather messy way of ending one's days. In this ritual, the ""performer"" opens his abdomen, starting from left to right and then finishing from top toward bottom. But there is so need to be left for hours contemplating one's entrails. Another swordsman acting as a ""second,"" called kaishakunin, is standing by to decapitate the departing at a pre-arranged moment in the ceremony. Lord Ieyasu Tokugawa, who founded Japan's last great shogunate dynasty in 1603, ordered the practice of harakiri to be discontinued by both secondary and primary retainers. Later on, in 1663, a stronger edict from Lord Nobutsuna Matsudaira of Izu, put an end to the practice altogether. By that time, the ritual had become an idle formalism, and the ""performer"" was decapitated at the instant he took his sword out of the scabbard, thus avoiding a painful death. In some instances, the sword was replaced by a fan.Hanshiro Tsugomo (Tatsuya Nakadai) comes to the castle of the Iyi Clan to seek revenge for the humiliation and cruel death of his son-in-law, Anjiwa Motome (Akira Ishihama). Kobayashi is a superb storyteller, and in a slow and deliberate rhythm, he develops his story, which could have been taken from the pages of the Iliad or of the Mahabharata. The tension grows, as the Clan members slowly realize that they are in turn being humiliated by this stranger who truly believe in the samurai code of honor: he must be terminated to prevent him to broadcast his truth.The final duel with the master swordsmen of the Clan, Hikukuro Omodaka, on the Plains of Gojin-in, is like a meditation, a ballet of death. The film ends in a spectacular combat, and the coup de grace to Hanshiro Tsugomo's seppuku is fittingly not applied by a gallant swordsman, but a cowardly platoon of muskets. Even to the end, the samurai honor code has been violated by the Clan.As Toshiro Mifune has long been associated with the success of Kurosawa's films, so are Kogayashi's films enhanced by the brilliant interpretation of Tatsuya Nakadai (also staring in the leading roles in Kurosawa's ""Kagemusha"",and ""Ran""). This outstanding actor contributed further to the success of this director's films, ""Kwaidan"" and the ""Samurai Rebellion."" The screenplay by Shinobu Hashimoto is based on a novel by Yasuhiko Takiguchi The cinematography, by Yoshio Miyajima, in black and white, is gorgeous. Many on the shots are ""haiku-like"" in the imagery. The musical score, written for an ensemble of ancient instruments and percussion by the renowned classical composer Toru Takemitsu, is used sparingly throughout the film, reinforcing the dramatic moments.Masaki Kobayashi's film is an indictment of the hypocrisy of the establishment, any establishment, would it be in feudal 17th Century Japan or in any other time. Dogma, on which the establishment's authority rests, is evil. The established, codified order, with all its smoke and mirrors, must be preserved at all costs, and nothing must be allowed to come in its way. It is the duty of each member of any government, organization, church, or brotherhood not to spare any effort and to go to any length to protect the appearances and status quo, to achieve this essential goal of survival. The end justifies the means, and no lie or deceit can be eliminated if this survival is at stake.Although taking place almost five centuries ago during the Tokugawa Shogunate, this film is also a strong denunciation of the entrenched cultural legacy of coercive rituals, blind obedience, and chauvinism that resulted in the tragedy of the Pacific War.The outstanding screenplay, the superb acting, the cinematography and editing makes ""Harakiri"" the best samurai film ever.","

"gubami","28 October 2004","When I first saw this movie, I did not know much about it. I saw it for a class so I was given a little background of the time period. In fact I was pretty much just told this: This movie takes place during the time where many Samurai were left ronins, or masterless. These samurai were unable to find work and thereby were left in poverty. Eventually many would go up to clans and ask to commit seppuku.It was dishonorable to refuse such a ""noble"" request, but most clans did not want samurai to kill themselves on their property so they would just pay the samurai to go elsewhere.So I watched the movie and well... I loved it. During the class discussion the next day I found most people hated the movie. Not because it was a bad movie, but because of how it made people feel about themselves. And that's exactly why this movie is genius. If you're interested in watching this movie, do not read the summary in detail - reading the summary in detail will deprive you of what one of the key things that made the movie great IMO.","

"tedg","4 February 2015","This has to be the best movie I have seen in a while. Good luck to me that I would like to pass on to you.We have two warring narrators. The first begins the film as an entry in his journal as local governor of a wealthy country estate. The film is closed with him finishing his entry, some days later. This official narrative deviates from what we see at the end.His story: one, then a second unattached ronin appeal to commit suicide in their courtyard. The first of these it is plain is just looking to be paid to leave, but our narrator is very strict about cleaving to that ronin's story. If he says he wants to kill himself, well then he must. This poor man had sold his sword and was now carrying bamboo, and it is this that he was forced to use. The resulting death is disturbing.So midway in the film, we have a samurai who has suffered because he was forced to live his story, forced by the narrator-governor who we later watch not live the story he has created and instead change it to suit.Now along comes an older samurai with the same request. He is dealt with in the same manner, but insists on telling a story to the assembled household before killing himself. He tells an amazing story: a fall from grace of his master, the dissolution of the household, poverty. His frail daughter and her son lay dying without a few coins for a doctor. The man's son is his daughter's husband, and it is he that came and was forced to die. The wife and son do as well, shortly after. Details of that death were told by the governor to the elder samurai earlier, though known because of the mocking way the body was returned.Until now, we have a classic case of warring narrative. We have the captive audience assembled. One storyteller is an official, so much so that he controls the official version of the film's story. The other has power in his gritty, true story. That story, incidentally is very close to what I consider noir: a random innocent fellow is cast in circumstances that seem full of circumstance and accident. The events of his life are played out not as they would in real life but as they would in a fictional life in a story told by others.Truth versus power in a struggle for the story of the film, essentially a struggle for the allegiance of the outer audience: us.The two beings as they face off are perfect in small mannerisms belying tension.Then slowly, the governor's world explodes as we learn new bits of the elder ronin's story of recent events. Many die.We (the audience) and control of all the cinematic effects was won by the ronin. Our governor is seen at the end writing the official account to be seen by his master that for his safety eradicates all story on both sides. The main actor, the winner, features in some of Kurosawa's best work as well.","

This samurai classic capers abroad its tale unlike anything else in cinematic existence, bleeding its reveals through evoking flashbacks, heated, verbal narratives, and hairsplitting symbolic portraits.I didn't expect Harakiri to be such a bold stance on the hypocritical flaws hidden among the ancient Japanese warrior traditions. It's beyond praiseworthy. Additionally, the closing battle's deviant, ingeniously choreographed ramification will have you and any other witness unreservedly floored. (Verdict: A)","

It is really a tremendous example of outstanding film making! The cinematography is absolutely exceptional! However it is the haunting plot of a samurai explaining the meaningless and worthless flawed belief of the samurai spirit which grips the viewer.Tatsuya Nakadais mighty performance in Harakiri further proves for me, that he is without a doubt one of best actors in the history of film. This man takes on his roles with such prowess that it is easy for the viewer to forget that you have seen him play a different role in another movie.By the way - The Criterion 2 disk DVD version is mint!

"gavin6942","7 January 2015","An elder ronin samurai (Tatsuya Nakadai) arrives at a feudal lord's home and requests an honorable place to commit suicide. But when the ronin inquires about a younger samurai (Akira Ishihama) who arrived before him things take an unexpected turn.For many, samurai films may be closer associated with Kurosawa... but this one, possibly the best ever made, comes from Masaki Kobayashi. How does Kobayashi not have the same level of international fame as Kurosawa? Interestingly, Hanshirō is able to fight off a great many retainers with a sword, yet is helpless against three guns; this is a foreshadow of the Meiji Restoration, wherein sword-bearing samurai were defeated by the ""new"" Japanese military. Indeed, the whole notion of ""honor"" and all that comes with it is radically changed once the battles become uneven.","

"FRANK13","12 May 1999","I have seen this movie numerous times (at least 10, probably many more), and enjoy it each time.  The first couple of times I saw it was right after it came out.  It did not have sub-titles, and as my Japanese is not very good, I made some assumptions about the characters, relationships, the plot,etc. When I saw it with sub-titles, I was surprised at how few incorrect assumptions I had made.  That I made so few errors is no credit to me, but rather to how well the plot, character development, character relationships, and the overall movie were done.The movie is not limited to feudal Japan, for it transcends this era.  It has lessons, for those who look for this in art.  For instance, just one example occurs to me now:  It underscores the need for a person to stand on principle, and to maintain their honor, ethics, and dignity, even when those who are the political leaders have long since lost theirs.  However for purely entertainment value, the realism, suspense, art, and action could not be better. Words fail to express how this film captivates and entertains. Few films can equal this one.  It is a ""must see.""","

Everything is this movie is exceptional: the cinematography is top notch, the acting is very good, the direction is almost perfect.Tragedy, revenge, ethics, political contents...this movie has all of these elements wrapped in an exceptional 16th century samurai environment.The only defects I could see in this movie is that someone may feel it is slightly slow (as actually there are very few action scenes...this is not a ""chambara"" movie!) and the fact that it is not dubbed (at least in the Italian edition)...so you lose some of the details while reading the subtitles....that is, unless you understand Japanese.If you like black & white Japanese movies this is definitely a must see. GREAT.","

"auberus","19 May 2008","Masaki Kobayashi studied art and philosophy before starting as assistant director at Shochiku studio. His oeuvre is guided by the need to understand the human condition. In the 1962 Hara-kiri aka Seppuku, we can clearly see the philosophic influence in this story about confrontation between Human condition and Rigid Code of a feudal society. The result of this confrontation is a multi layered masterpiece in which the clarity of the script, the perfection of the interpretation, and a very well balanced ""mise en scène"" make for a powerful film based on transgression: a genre transgression, a code transgression and an image transgression. Most of Shambaras take place during the Edo Period but rather late in that period (just before the Meiji Era) as most filmmakers try to romanticize and glamorize the period which marks the end of the Samurai thus playing the nostalgia card. Here Masaki Kobayashi transgressed the genre and decided to film a story taking place in 1630, 17th century Japan during the Edo period. At that time Japan was ruled by a Shogunate (Ieyasu Tokugawa). The Tokugawa Shoguns established Peace and continued to rule Japan for a remarkable 250 years. But such a long period of Peace had a price and Ieyasu Tokugawa brought the whole country under tight control. He cleverly redistributed the land among the more loyal vassals, breaking up warrior clans thus throwing thousands of samurai into poverty. In the film an elder ronin, Hanshiro Tsugumo, the hypnotic Tatsuya Nakadai (Goyokin) seeks admittance to the house of a feudal lord to commit the act of Seppuku as he can no longer stand his Life of Dishonor and Poverty. There, the administrator tells him about the fate of a young Samurai who committed the same suicidal ritual few times ago. But there is much more to this story and soon we understand that all protagonists are related one way or another. As the film progresses we witness a confrontation between two conceptions. One is based on a Human code; the other is based on a rigid traditional one. Masaki Kobayashi uses both symbols and raw images to show this confrontation. The film starts with the Display of a Samurai shining battle armor representing the feudal system. The armor is empty of anything human and strongly symbolized the feudal system. Can a code make sense if it is followed without acknowledging the Human condition? This is in essence the question raised by ""Hara-kiri"". We see this armor soiled and dragged but at the end of the film the armor remains intact as if nothing had ever happened, as if changes in an given Society take some times to occur. Indeed social Progress has always been slow leaving Men and Women struggling with their condition. The suicidal ritual, Hara-kiri reinforced the sense of cruelty. Raw images of Ronin opening their stomach with a sword were a transgression at that time (1962), still is today. In the film the ritual is portrayed in a non glamorized way and very realistically. It also symbolizes even for the Japanese audience the lack of sense in the act of Seppuku. In fact Hanshiro Tsugumo is the only one giving meaning to this act by motivating it with mixed feelings of Love, Revenge and Sorrow, in short with humanity. With the film Hara-kiri, Masaki Kobayashi signed one of the greatest philosophical films. The script by Shinobu Hashimoto is a good example on how to make a story clear but more importantly sufficient enough for anybody to understand the drama, in one word universal. Also writer of Jôi-uchi: Hairyô tsuma shimatsu aka Samurai Rebellion (1967), Dai-bosatsu tôge (1966) aka Sword of Doom or ""Hitokiri"" aka Tenchu (1969), Shinobu Hashimoto is among the greatest writers of the 7th Art. I can not recommend Seppuku enough, every single frame, acting, piece of music is irreproachable. The story is profoundly Humanist, timeless and universal. I suggest we all confront the codes of our respective societies in order to find out if they still make sense or if they are leading us towards a terrible social Hara-kiri","

"classicsoncall","4 March 2018","Unlike all the Kurosawa films I've seen, this one has a principal protagonist that announces his intention early in the story and then takes the viewer on a stunning journey of revenge that's entirely unexpected. Director Masaki Kobayashi prepares the viewer with a preliminary accounting of the fate of thousands of unemployed Samurai as a result of the 17th Century dissolution of the Japanese Shogunate. Masterless Samurai, or ronin, appear at the doorstep of a feudal lord requesting a place in which to perform ritual suicide, but for the dishonorable, this effort is merely a ploy to accept some small token of monetary value before moving on. ""Harakiri"" tells the story of two such ronin, and until we learn the true relationship of both men to each other, the viewer is at a loss to understand the real motivation of Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai). With frequent forays into the past utilizing a series of flashbacks, Tsugumo relates the story of his son-in-law, helpless in the face of his wife's deteriorating physical condition and unable to seek medical attention for their sick baby due to lack of resources. What I found quite clever about the story was the absence of the three men Tsugumo called for to be his seconds for the purpose of hara-kiri. One realizes that it can't be simple coincidence that none of these men are available, as the story swerves to a desperate climax that pits Tsugumo against the entire House of Iyi. What would have been a tremendous let down in the story is avoided when Tsugumo follows through on his original mission, unable to physically overpower all the retainers employed by the clan's Master. So many films have the story's hero defeat an overwhelming number of rival opponents that it reduces the credibility factor to zero. At the point Tsugumo knows he can no longer pursue a fight strategy, he takes his life in the ritual manner. For followers of Japanese cinema, this film is a must see, with it's emphasis on honor, loyalty and embracing the truth of one's convictions. Tsugumo's unselfish final act unmasks the hypocrisy of the feudal lord's position, and mocks the cowardice of it's counselor Saito (Rentarô Mikuni). An appropriate amount of swordplay attends the story without becoming excessive, allowing for the more subtle aspects of Tsugumo's strategy to take over the narrative, which it does in compelling fashion.","

"WaveTossed","28 June 2005","A classic, surviving the test of time -- made in 1962 about 17th century people. Here in 2005, we still watch and discuss the film and the issues that it raises. Tsugumo Hanshiro, a middle-aged ronin formerly serving a clan abolished by the Shogunate, appears at the Ii clan gate. He wishes to commit seppuku rather than live on in poverty. In his inner headquarters, Saito Kageyu, the chief retainer, bemoans the fact that hordes of starving ronin have been making similar requests at clan gates; most have wanted handouts rather than to actually commit seppuku. Kageyu suspects the same of Hanshiro. Kageyu attempts to discourage Hanshiro. He tells a tale of another ronin from the same abolished clan, Chijiiwa Motome. Motome had appeared a few months earlier, with a request, but had carried bamboo sword blades  the clan members had been enraged. As an example to other scrounging ronin, particularly those without real blades, the clan decided to force Motome to commit seppuku with his own bamboo wakizashi. Hanshiro tells his own life story. The film shows us some historical background. Thousands of ex-retainers had been thrown out of their positions, made into ronin, by the Shogunate's abolishing of clans. In the rigid class system (samurai, farmers, artisans, merchants), these displaced ex-retainers had no place at all, being forced into marginal subsistence. Most trades (because they required long periods of apprenticeship) were out for most ronin. Many ronin became outlaws or obtained bodyguard positions for gangsters. If law-abiding, they were able to teach in schools for commoner children. Or become piecework artisans; they could contract with wholesalers (who also lent money) to make fans, umbrellas, insect cages, ink brushes, and the like. Even as most ronin had to fend for themselves in this netherworld, they still were to carry the two swords of their original rank, and to uphold their obligations. Hanshiro and his daughter Miho make umbrellas and fans to sell to wholesalers for a pittance; Hanshiro is in debt to one of the wholesalers. Motome teaches commoner children and receives a minimal wage for his work. Miho and Motome marry and have a son. All goes well until sickness strikes. Miho contracts consumption and the child contracts a fever. Neither Hanshiro nor Motome can afford a doctor. Motome attempts to get a laborer job (which pays more than teaching does) and runs straight into job discrimination: ""no starving ronin need apply."" Motome sells his sword blades at a pawnshop, obtaining bamboo blades to wear inside his sword fittings, not an uncommon practice; some ronin (and some low-ranked clan samurai) desperately needed money. And yet, the sword was considered to be ""the soul of the bushi."" A bushi who sold his blades had to appear to wear the badge of his rank. The bamboo blades were available, thus no one would know of the despicable act of having sold his ""soul"" for money.But Motome has not received enough; he still cannot afford a doctor. So Motome decides on something more desperate: to appear at a clan gate, with his hidden bamboo blades, in order to request seppuku -- with the actual intention of receiving a handout to get a doctor for his wife and child. The Ii clan officials have decided differently. The scene where Motome must commit seppuku with his bamboo wakizashi is one of the most harrowing scenes ever filmed. Motome is utterly humiliated, surrounded by the Ii clan retainers, with Onodaka Hikokuro, his assigned second preaching on how the sword is the soul of the samurai, the bamboo sword is what is appropriate for Motome, and so forth. While Motome painfully carries forth. Hikokuro refuses Motome's request to cut off his head and end the ritual's mockery, so Motome ends it himself, biting off his tongue. Hanshiro has realized -- too late -- that he had never dared to even consider selling his own sword blades to help out the family. The scene when he is confronted with Motome's body and the truth of what has happened is truly gut-wrenching, as Hanshiro weeps and slams down his ""useless tokens"" that he had clung to. Hanshiro reveals his own secret  he has used his ""useless tokens"" to avenge Motome's death. He has tracked down the three Ii retainers who were most responsible for Motome's death. The final duel between Hanshiro and Onodaka Hikokuro is absolutely stunning. Instead of taking the lives of these three, Hanshiro has taken their topknots. And while Kageyu has preached to Hanshiro about samurai honor, these three swordsmen have hidden themselves away, claiming sickness to cover up their own shame, while their topknots grow back. Kageyu cannot deal with Hanshiro's revelations. He commands his men to slaughter Hanshiro. Hanshiro fights back gamely, taking four of the Ii clan retainers and wounding several more. In a symbolic scene, he tears down the ancestral armor of the Ii clan. Some Ii clansmen use their rifles against Hanshiro, but Hanshiro sticks his own sword into his belly, committing seppuku as he has pledged to do. In the end, Kageyu fashions a cover-up of the entire event; mysterious plagues have hit the Ii clan and a number of their retainers, including Onodaka, have died of ""illness"" rather than by the blade of an impoverished hungry ronin. This film raises many issues. It is Kobayashi's impassioned protest against rigidly militaristic societies that uphold hypocritical codes of ""bushido"" while disdaining what that term really means. The film is also like a Greek tragedy, with a character (Tsugumo Hanshiro) possessing the tragic flaw of his own pride -- which in the end, he must pay for with his life. Which he does in a heroic way. This film doesn't just recount the oppression of poor people. It shows the strength that these poor people have, the choices that they make as individuals, refusing to just bow down and be mere victims of their society.","

"42ndStreetMemories","12 November 2009","I have seen 6,035 motion pictures in my life. I have seen many of these more than once. I am not boasting. Nor am I proud that not only have I spent so many years of my life in front of a flickering screen but that I actually know the number of films that I have seen.With that said, ""Seppuku"" (""Hara-kiri"") makes that whole trip worth while. For every hundred pieces of celluloid tripe you can be fortunate to find a diamond in the rough and for me that was my first experience with this Kobayashi masterpiece. Pure enjoyment, pure excitement.The film is brilliantly constructed and multi-layered in such a way that the film defies genre classification. To call it a ""samurai film"" is akin to categorizing ""Psycho"" as a murder mystery. ""Seppuku"" could easily slide into the mystery, suspense, drama, or western genres and feel right at home. Perhaps an eastern film noir, if you will.Kobayashi's telling of the tale incorporates elements of despair, tradition, fortitude, revenge but mostly love, pride and honor in a grand visual style.The story's setting, direction and Tatsuya Nakadai's strong performance invite the inevitable comparison to Kurosawa and his favorite samurai Toshiro Mifune. All are of such high merit that I would propose ignoring the temptation to compare and appreciate the genius involved in ""Seppuku"".For those who have not seen ""Seppuku"" of course I strongly recommend that you do so but I also suggest that you avoid reading any synopsis and take delight in watching the tale unfold.10/10 (and not too many of the 6,035 are 10's)","

"lee_eisenberg","30 September 2022","One of the major players in Japanese cinema in the post-war era was Masaki Kobayashi. I should admit that ""Seppuku"" (""Harakiri"" in English) is the first of his movies that I've seen. Basically, it's an indictment of feudal hypocrisy, and also a warning about over-idealizing history. Rather than simply a samurai movie, this is an anti-samurai movie. The protagonist is a ronin (a samurai without a leader) in a peacetime era in Japan's history. Coming to an estate, he hopes to take his own life, but this is merely the jumping-off point for a long, complex story.In addition to the acting and directing, the viewer should pay attention to the sets. They're arranged so as to establish a mood. The Criterion DVD includes interviews with the director, screenwriter and star, all of whom talk about the challenges of making the movie. Kobayashi had anti-authoritarian tendencies, and these come out in the movie, with its challenge to militarism and entrenched power. Basically, to dislike this movie is to have no humanity.All in all, it's no surprise that ""Harakiri"" often turns up on the lists of the greatest movies of all time. If you consider yourself a film buff, then you owe it to yourself to see this movie.","

"cwkenreich","9 June 2021","Harakiri is an outsatanding and underrated Japanese masterpiece. It seems to be heavily overshadowed by so-called magnum opuses like seven samurai. However, this samurai film was truly incredible in almost every way. The visuals and the themes complimented each other perfectly. It really shed light on the samurai experience like no film before and subverts expectations with regards to numerous samurai cliches.The recurring mood of this movie is deceitful. Nothing should be interpreted at face value. Our protagonist Tsugumo enters seemingly disturbing the peace at the honorable House of Iyi. He even wears a dark outfit, deceiving one into thinking that he is evil in nature. One would expect that Tsugumo would promptly carry out his ""wish"" of dying honorably. Given that we know nothing about him and that the camera often keeps physical distance from him, he initially does not evoke pity. However he repeatedly prolongs the ritual, much to the annoyance of Sennukko. And Tsugumo finally tells his grand tale which subverts all of our expectations. It's revealed that he is the victim of corrupt government policies initiated by indifferent upper-class elites. He is really out to vent his grievances in front members of the elite.But the film doesn't stop there. Part of its magic was just truly how unpredictable it was. Not only was Tsugumo lying in his intentions, he revealed that three of his proposed ""seconds"" to his harakiri were not sick at all, but could not face the humiliation of losing their buns. The final lines in the film in which sennukko orders the events of the film to be whitewashed to preserve the House's dignity, accentuates the theme of subversion. This is supported when the camera cuts at some of the most climactic moments. While not my original observation, I'd like to echo other reviews in acknowledging how in every death or samurai battle, we never actually see anyone die, or have their hair cut off. It's as if the audience is denied the convenience of being eyewitnesses and instead must accept Sennukko's words with submission.I've read how this film, while taking place in the 17th century, has striking parallels to Japanese institutions during WWII, however I admit to being no aficionado on Japanese history.This was my interpretation of the film. Samurais are often depicted as saviors and honorable warriors (ahem all of kurosawa's films), but this interpretation of them has to be the most pitiful and revealing.In terms of entertainment value, this film was easily 10/10. We grow intrigued as our bereaved protagonist asks to commit ritual suicide after facing poverty. We then have to witness the cringy demise of one previous man named Chijiwa. As we are awaiting Tsugumo to succumb to the same fate, he creates tension by interrupting the procedure with his own anecdotes, where we learn an emotional backstory surrounding the loss of his job and ALL of his immediate family. As if this weren't intriguing enough, the suspense is cranked up when Tsugumo reveals how he retrieved the hair buns and preaches about the evil workings of the ruling class. The ending is a well earned and a well executed climax of realistic and authentic fight choreography for the time the film was made.Again, I don't know how historically accurate this film was and I'm certain many inevitably dismissed it as political propaganda, but the execution of this movie from a filmmaking standard was near meticulous in my opinion.Best Samurai film and probably the best foreign film I've ever seen! 10/10.","

Here you... have a clean three dimensional view of the scene both as a figure of speech but also visually the film is 3D. Can't remember one of the recent productions that have a camera that could compare to this one. No CGI and still gives a strong feeling of space and of the restrains of that given space.

"briancham1994","4 July 2021","This film ranks as a masterpiece among samurai films for its humanistic critique of the rigid, hierarchical bushido code of conduct. The samurai who espouse this code are depicted as either malicious or enslaved by its snare - reduced to begging or arbitrarily enforcing it as a tool of humiliation. The story unfolds in a gradual way, revealing how all the characters have interacted in the past, bringing a lot of context to the situation in the courtyard. This is all punctuated with skillful cinematography of claustrophobic architecture, heartfelt acting and desperate swordfights.","

"paolaxsanchez13","17 June 2014","This film is narrated by more than on e person. However the main character, Hanshiro, gets to tell his full story of how and why he got there to the Iyi Clan. There is suspicion from the beginning when he is asked if he really ants to perform harakiri or if he simply wants money or a job. The counselor asks him this and Hanshiro replies the same answer that his son in law, Motome, did when he came in search for an open hand. Through Hanshiro's story telling, we are able to see the true meaning for why he is there; revenge for his lost family. Althpugh his intention is not on killing them, he simply wants them to acknowledge the unethical way they went about with Motome. In the beginning of them movie, the Iyi Clan armor is depicted as honorable, brave and even a little frightening however after the plot uncovers how the samurai retainers acted, the armor becomes an insignificant and worthless statue.","

And for a film about a ritual suicide, I've not been so excited and burst out in laughter in a long time as I did with this one. But I'm not going to say more, because the less you know seeing this film, the better - even the current plot summary on the films page gives away too much, and I'm just happy I didn't read it as I started watching this film. All I can say is that with the fame Kurosawa and Mifune have with their samurai film, I just hope that Masaki Kobayashi and Tatsuya Nakadai will be more known to the world as time goes by, they belong up there with the masters.Currently at the 33th spot on the top 250 list when I'm writing this text, I can only see it go higher with time when more people discover this gem of a film.","

Arriving in a white case with the title in small font, I put it on the end of a shelf before leaving,where it remained lost for years! Rearranging things during Lockdown, I was surprised to discover that this film had been facing me the whole time.View on the film:Bringing the sword down on this adaptation of Yasuhiko Takiguchi's novel by titling Hanshiro Tsugumo ""The ronin from Hiroshima"", the screenplay by Shinobu Hashimoto brings the defiance against authority in post-WWII Japan to the early beginnings, of what would become a consolidation of power, leading to the 250 year Tokugawa reign.Seating Hanshiro face to face with Saito in the house of Li Clan palace, the poetic dialogue Hashimoto balances the blade with the refine allegorical brutal, feudal authority of the Li Clan being used to rip the other clans and samurai's of the land apart, leading to Hashimoto striking back,and exposing the fragility from shattering their orders.Bringing Hanshiro into the palace pledging to commit harakiri, Hashimoto skilfully blades the allegorical with a absolutely thrilling samurai tale, drawing Hanshiro's compassion for his family with a fierce, passionate fire to fight and save the individualism of his family, up against the authoritative band of Li Clan.Saying later in a interview with Joan Mellen in 1972 that ""In any era, I am critical of authoritarian power."" directing auteur Masaki Kobayashi reunites with cinematographer Yoshio Miyajima, and stylishly displays his rebellion against authoritarian rule with the empty suit of armor hanging above the Li Clan palace like a gargoyle, which Kobayashi brings crashing down to earth via Hanshiro throwing the façade of power from the armor,right back at Li Clan.Cutting Toru Takemitsu's score to sparse inserts, Kobayashi displays a expertise in the use of silence, filling the Li Clan palace with Hanshiro's anguished words, being only interrupted by the lone sound of wooden panels being stepped on as guards rush to Saito's side.Igniting a lit fuse atmosphere which ends in a thrilling final fight, (where real swords were used!) that breaks the walls of the Li Clan palace, Kobayashi begins to shake the foundation with long static camera shots a few feet from the floor listening to Hanshiro, that Kobayashi starkly cracks with tightened close-ups on Hanshiro's agonised face,and refined zoom-ins on the terror sinking into Saito's face.Reuniting with Kobayashi,Tatsuya Nakadai gives a incredibly raw performance as Hanshiro, thanks to the love and warmth Hanshiro gives to his family, being contrasted by Nakadai with a simmering rage to fight for freedom freed from harakiri","

"claszdsburrogato","2 December 2023","Harakiri is the highest-rated film on Letterboxd, but does it deserve such praise? In my opinion, it is a masterpiece. One of the best films in history. Harakiri explores a fascinating narrative. The character development throughout the plot, told in a non-linear way, flows in a phenomenal way. We are introduced to a cizudo character, who seems to have no emotions and someone who has been through a lot of things. Then, during a flashback, we watch the story of a young man who seems innocent and lost in life. It's a cruel film, which doesn't succeed in shocking you visually if necessary for the narrative. It's incredible to follow the protagonist's story and see him go through different moments in his life. Happiness, despair and revenge. Harakiri is a masterpiece of cinema.","

"planktonrules","15 October 2006","This film was very well-made and the story is excellent. The story begins with a man asking his local warlord permission to commit ritual suicide. His reason is that the country has been at peace so long that ronin (out of work and master-less Samurai) have no income and nothing to do. So, instead of the indignity of just wasting away, a vicious and painful suicide is apparently the best option! Instead of instantly granting this request, the Counselor tells the suicidal ronin about a similar request that occurred recently and how the ronin who killed himself probably only asked for permission to die as a ruse to get money from the warlord! In other words, this other man had hoped that his request would NOT be granted and he would instead been given a small income. But, not wanting to see the Bushido code perverted, the warlord demanded that this man commit ritual suicide--even though the sword the ronin had was made of bamboo and doing the painful ritual was super-painful and difficult with such a sword.This story was pretty interesting but how it related to this second ronin is what makes this story so interesting. Plus, I loved how the story ended.Overall, I think this is a bit of an ""anti-Samurai"" film, as it talked how adherence to the rules of Bushido actually could be very cruel and violate the spirit of the feudal system. The inherent cruelty and desire to only worry about appearances instead of right and wrong make this an excellent and intriguing movie. Good stuff.","

Masaki Kobayashi does an extraordinary job of incorporating western elements along with typical Japanese humor and vengeance, to deliver one of the key Jidai-Geki films in the history of Japanese cinema. The central idea of the film is to expose the audience to the egotistical, dishonorable side of the samurai, and does so by following Hanshiro (the protagonist) as he calls out the Iyi Clan for disobeying the Bushido Code. Samurai's live off honor, but in a world full of war and violence, this film proves that all morals and honor can be lost, and reveals the sick ways that people go about getting a form of entertainment.","

"jgbgraham","4 November 2023","This is one of the best movies you will ever watch. Hara-Kiri pierces the ethereal soul like a blade cuts across stomach flesh. A spectacular tragic mystery builds up with tremendous pace to the point you feel this nearly 2hr20min is just 90 minutes of pure, unfiltered samurai intrigue. This film is one of the few I would personally break the scale for and give an 11/10. Beyond perfection. Pretty much to the point of transcending our reality as it has long since transcended the film medium to become the Ronin gospel. The lead actor gives a haunting performance that has lingered in my mind for awhile and is the main reason I am writing this review. It simply must be seen by anybody who likes good movies... that's everyone last I checked.","

"Koundinya","23 June 2012","While Japanese movies are synonymous to Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune, this movie has neither of them. It's an unprecedented movie that leaves you brood over the plight of the once-great-warriors of the medieval Japan. The movie is aided by brilliant handling of the camera and loud yet powerful background music. The duel between Tsugumo and Omodaka set in the backdrop of plains with bushes ruffling against the gale was the most impressive scenes in the movie.Samurais, warriors known for their fighting skills and adept wielders of sword, are unemployed and are forced to live in penury after their clans make truce. They even struggle to get a job with workers demanding samurais not be employed. They resort to threatening other clans by saying they'd perform ancient religious practice of Hara-kiri, which is to disembowel oneself, if they are not awarded with a bounty.One such samurai Tsugumo offers his life to the Lyi clan. He's enlightened with the story of a man who gave exactly the same details as Tsugumo. They narrate the story of a certain Motome, who was so poverty-stricken that he had a bamboo instead of a blade and performs the practice in the most atrocious fashion. Motome's sacrifice served as an example to all those samurais who seek fortune in the name of intimidation to end one's life. Tsugumo confesses he was willing to perform hara-kiri whole-heartedly bu wishes his head be slashed by a great warrior of the clan. The warrior is ill and Tsugumo suggests two more names and all the three men have taken ill. The head of the clan senses Tsugumo's plot to procrastinate. Tsugumo wishes to narrate his story before it's time to enter the other world.He concedes that he and Motome were acquainted. Motome was his son-in-law, who taught in the neighborhood to earn a living. Stricken by poverty and an ailing wife and neonate son in the house, he fails to find a job and even sells his priced sword to earn a little money. He then heads to the Lyi clan to implore for the money but he's forced into performing Hara-kiri. Without medication and care, Tsugumo's daughter and grandson pass on. Tsugumo enlightens the men of the clan what actually happened to the men who responsible for his son-in-law's death in a way. An exasperated head orders Tsugumo be severed by the swords and pierced by spears. Tsugumo resists for a while, takes the life of 4 and lacerates 8 others before he dies.The head of the clan orders the 3 absentees be killed by skilled men and cover up all the killings in the name of illness thereby receiving appreciation from the administration.A 10/10 movie.","

"john_billings19","4 January 2004","Seppuku opens up with a shot of the samurai battle armor. Simply a shell with nothing in it at the time. Seppuku reveals the hypocrisy and emptiness in the samurai code and that things are not always as they seem. It challenges traditional belief of honor and what is to be done and simply not to be done. Through the movie the director leads us into belief that Motome is a bad samurai. He is masterless and furthermore unable to provide for his family. It opens up with his preformed seppuku in which everything goes wrong for Motome, we see his as a horrible honor less samurai. Motome comes to the house obviously to beg for food or money. We see that his swords, the soul of the samuari, were sold for bamboo ones. Than he begs for leave seemingly to run away to not have to perform the seppuku. However, things are not as they seem. Hanshiro shows up to the house of the same group. Than, he tells the story as it actually was. Motome was actually trying to provide for his family. He sold his swords for food and comfort for his dieing wife. Then comes to the house to beg for money only so he can afford a doctor for his dying infant son as well. When Motome begs for leave before his seppuku he actually needs time to go back to his family to tell them that he was unsuccessful in getting money and they would have to find other means. What is more just or had more honor, following the samurai code, or trying to save the lives of your dying family members. The writer answers that later in the movie. Hanshiro defeats every samurai that brought his son in law back to him dead by cutting off their top knots. If the house had the honor that they said they did than these three samurai would commit seppuku. None of the samurai do. They fake an illness so their topknot can grow back. The author shows that the samurai honor is really just a front, it is just an image, like the old samurai battle armor. The code represents who they want to be, but the honor is not there. Seppuku is a great story about hypocrisy and fake honor of the samurai code.","

"lasttimeisaw","16 October 2020","""Most actions are confined in the palace's courtyard and other indoor spaces, HARAKIRI flags up Kobayashi's optimal stagecraft, the geometrical blocking of actors, the wide-screen spatial compositions, stationary but never feel constricted; when the actor moves, like in the final one-against-many mêlée, everything is crystallized to a T, the minutely calibrated choreography, the lethal slash and damage caused by the swordplay, and Nakadai's total abandon into a bleeding beast and desperate iconoclast. In a sense, the set piece is even more extraordinary than Kurosawa's best offers in YOJIMNO and SEVEN SAMURAI, because Hanshiro is outnumbered, doomed, a forlorn hope who fights until his last breath, a hero whose valor and integrity will not be extolled but buried, but when the dust settles, we actually feel triumphant for him, what a glorious death!""","

"Suomi_perkele","8 October 2006","Seppuku or harakiri is a samurai ritual where an elderly samurai cuts his belly open with a small sword and makes a cross in his flesh. After cutting other samurai cuts his head of to end the pain. And like this a samurai will die honorably.Seppuku tells a story of one elderly samurai named Hanshiro Tsugumo who has lots of things to tell before his harakiri. He tells a story about his beautiful daughter and her life. You can tell that the other samurais aren't actually very pleased with his story telling because the man just doesn't know when to stop. When Hanshiro finally finishes his stories there won't be his harakiri. No, then a great battle will begin. The influence of Seppuku in modern cinema is obvious. The final battle sequence is lot like in Kill Bill vol.1. And that's not the only thing that is similar to some movies of this date.Tatsuya Nakadai does great job in Hanshiro's role and the rest of the cast aren't bad either. Visual aspects of Seppuku are beautiful and the movie itself is very tough provoking. Well it's hard for me to put all into words because of the language barrier but I'll just say this: Seppuku is amazingly deep and beautiful movie which criticizes the mindless samurai ritual they call harakiri. I'm sorry I can't say much - after all I am young and Finish so English doesn't come so naturally for me. But It's easy for me to say - go and watch Seppuku, it's truly a great movie.Now it's time for me to watch other movies of Masaki Kobayashi.","

"filipemanuelneto","22 May 2023","In addition to having a very strong film industry, Japan is a country with a very rich past that we in the West tend to devalue. A somewhat ethnocentric attitude, more typical of small minds. For a long time, the Japanese were a people divided by several feudal princes who fought among themselves, disputing power and regional influence. It was in this context, moreover, that the first contact between the Japanese and the Portuguese took place, the first Westerners to disembark, demonstrably (Marco Polo speaks of the Japanese, but he probably never went there), on the islands of Japan, where they took the first firearm, the Christian faith and a strong cultural influence: even today, in the Japanese language, there are hundreds of words directly imported from Portuguese.The film that brought me here tells us about one of the most fascinating traditional figures of Japan: the samurai, a warrior similar, in essence, to the European knight. They were educated people who were willing to live off the war, as paid mercenaries. In a land where each feudal lord wages war for himself, with his own troops and against his neighbors, it was not difficult to live off war. It would be difficult to live in peace! The samurai had a code of conduct, the Bushido, which dictated rules according to which they guided their lives, seeking to live and die with honor. Honor was more important than life and therefore, in certain situations, it was expected that the samurai knew how to die and was willing to do so, even if by his own hands, in a suicide ritual.The film begins when a samurai, left unemployed by a long peace, turns to an old man and asks to be allowed to die. In response, he hears a story that occurred some time before, and in which a samurai in the same situation made an identical request in the expectation of receiving money, and ended up having to commit suicide, and with a wooden weapon. The film then reveals an important fact: this first samurai is the father-in-law of the man who killed himself, and who wanted money to feed his sick wife and son. And in fact that warrior is not there in order to simply die, but in order to avenge the son-in-law wronged by human hypocrisy.The film is quite dense, and the fact that it is so different from Western cinema and, even more so, in black and white, can quite scare the current public. However, it is worth resisting this impulse to reject it and giving the film a chance. It's very well done, it has a pretty good story, which is nothing behind big Hollywood hits. The script takes advantage of the situation to expose the brutality of the rigor imposed on the samurai by means of a moral code so absurdly demanding that it ended up being inhumane. Contrary to what happens in some films, even western ones, this film does a good historical contextualization of the story it tells us, not being too difficult to understand what is at stake. I'm not the best person to talk about the director or the actors, I don't know them, but I can say that we have the participation of Tatsuya Nakadai, Yoshiro Aoki and Akira Ishihama. On a technical level, I think it's impossible to avoid noticing the quality of the sets and filming locations, as well as the sharpness and quality of the cinematography.","

"eddie_baggins","26 October 2020","Firmly entrenched in movie bible IMDB's Top 250 Films of All-Time list, Masaki Kobayashi's anti-samurai film remains to this day a stunningly crafted achievement that subverts its genre's expectations to give us a samurai film that favors talking and mystery over sword play and sensationalising.Set in the 17th century where newfound peace in the Japanese landscape has forced many samurai warriors that were previously hired for their bloodthirsty skill-sets to be forced out of work and large portions of them seeking to perform a ritual suicide known as seppuku, Harakiri (named for its referencing of this suicidal act) introduces us to a samurai clan working in the house of Lord Lyi as the clan plays host to a humiliating act of the seppuku of a young warrior that eventually leads to the arrival of the mysterious Hanshiro Tsugumo who too seeks to perform his last act in the house.Played out at a quiet but steady pace, Yoshio Miyajima steady camera work capturing every moment and Tôru Takemitsu's unnerving and perfectly suited score working alongside it, Harakiri is one of the era's most proficiently constructed affairs that may at times seem as though its headed for predictable outcomes only to change course unexpectedly throughout as its heartbreaking and confronting narrative takes place around Tatsuya Nakadai's tortured and determined Hanshiro.Working as both an unflinching examination of the samurai code and also as an exploration of post Japanese sentiment in the aftermath of their countries moving forward in the wake of World War 2 and their acceptance of long-forged laws, regulations and traditions, Harakiri evolves from its seemingly simplistic set-up to become an allergy and nuanced deep-dive into the countries history while at all times remaining a haunting character examination.Steering well clear of the over acting and hastily put together aspects that haunted many other similar productions and products of this era in general, Kobayashi's guiding hand help craft Harakiri into an ageless and captivating piece of movie-making, with the underrated Nakadai delivering one of Japanese cinema's great leading turns and the collective supporting cast all bringing their characters to life with carefully considered and well attuned performances.Unafraid to explore its dark themes and moments (a drawn out and horrifying suicide at the hand of a bamboo sword is still hard to sit through in today's more tolerant environment), Harakiri is deserving of its lauded reputation, even if many other higher profile ""samurai"" themed films outshine it in the general public spectrum.Final Say -A film best watched with as little knowledge as possible leading into it, Harakiri is a powerful and confronting piece of Japanese cinema that has remained relevant and required viewing these many years on since its release.4 1/2 bamboo knives out of 5","

"fpyqvcc","9 April 2022","Note: Everything I say in this review is simply my opinion and I do not state it as an objective factHara-Kiri is my personal favorite movie that I've ever seen. The only reason I don't give it a solid 10/10 is because I believe a movie can always be at least somewhat better, even if it's only the smallest detail that is changed. But anyway, I love this movie so much and here's what I love about it:First off I love Cinematography/Direction in this movie. There are so many incredible shots that just add so much to the movie. There's the close up, odd angle shots in the scene where Motome commits harakiri, the shots showing Hanshiro unfazed by the clan around him, the shots where the background is just nothingness, directing the audiences eyes to the important foreground with shots such as the ones of the clans armor, Motome's dead body lying in front of Hanshiro and Miho, and Hanshiro stabbing himself, dying honorably after getting what he wants. And there's the wide angle action shots where action and movement are all over the frame. The direction truly brings the script to life.And Secondly, I love the writing of this movie. I find it to make this story be such a mysterious, emotional, and intriguing story. The main character,Hanshiro, I think is extremely well written, how there are two parallel stories of his going on, the story he's telling, showing the tragedy he went through, showing how he went from a fun happy man to being an emotionless expressionless man with only one goal in mind, while the other story is what he goes through in present time, showing him go from an emotionless man to slowly revealing his vengeful yet understandable motive to the clan. And all of this wouldn't have been as good as it was if Tatsuya Nakadai wasn't able to play this character so well. I also love the dialogue in this movie, it doesn't seem like the script was written by a robot. The back and forth between Hanshiro and Saito is like an action scene with words.I also love the poeticness of the movie. I loved the armor, that at first has no seen meaning, there's nothing we know about it, but later we see that it's the corrupt heart of the clan, that Hanshiro, getting to the heart of the clan while breaking down the walls and then ending up on his hands and knees still pursuing the armor, and then getting to it and throwing it on the ground, getting what he wants, to make a fool of and to spit in the face of this evil clan, and the he kills himself, dying honorably, showing us what an honorable death looks like, what an honorable harakiri looks like, not a huge event meant to abuse someone for the sake of ""honor"" but a death accompanied with the success of a plan with a noble cause. And then the clan tries to hide how he's ruined them, getting rid of the blood stained cloths and propping up their clans armor again, with an ending that looks pretty much the same as the beginning, but this time we understand the meaning behind what we see. But it's still an ambiguous ending, did Hanshiro really win? I view it as yes and I think that the ending is meant to show that while they can physically clean their mansion, we have now seen the stain of what they have done which is ultimately what Hanshiro wanted, to expose the corruption of those who caused the death of everyone that mattered to himAnd then just some other smaller things I love in this movie are the score, which can be exciting, shocking, ambiguous, or saddening, but no matter what, it always adds to the scene. I also love the action, I've already said I think the direction adds a lot the action scenes, but I also just think that the action itself is so well choreographed and actually realistic.Verdict: Hara-Kiri is an amazing written and directed movie, that is poetic, exciting, emotional, and intriguing, In my opinion, It is an absolute masterpiece.","

"bkrauser-81-311064","27 March 2016","American ethos has always had a soft-spot for the conscientious objector. We're a nation of fervent individualists and everything from the writings of Mark Twain to the film 12 Angry Men (1957) codifies that idea. The power of an individual against a torrent of common corruption and blind group-think is almost fetishized, especially in contemporary society. The Japanese, generally speaking, don't have such a provocative streak of individualism embedded in their culture. So it's interesting that one of the most eloquent and austerely beautiful films on the subject should come from the land of the rising sun. Harakiri is a repudiation of the collective values of Japan that, on its best days unites a population in tragedy and at its worst marches a people towards war.Hanshiro Tsugumo (Nakadai) is an aging and embittered samurai whose feudal lord has died in battle along with most of his men. In order to reclaim his honor, according to the bushido code, Tsugumo must disembowel himself in a ritual suicide known as seppuku. To do this he arrives at the feet of Saito Kageyu (Mikuni) and asks members of the Iyi daimyo to help him do the ceremony correctly. Kageyu is hesitant as only a few days ago a similar request was made by another ronin who had no intention of committing seppuku but was looking to extort the clan for money. After Kageyu retells the man's tale, which culminates in the ronin dying by the blade of a bamboo sword, Tsugumo insists his intentions are to die with honor. Yet as the pavilion where the deed is to be done is setup, questions remain. What is Tsugumo's connection to the earlier ronin? Why did he pick the courtyard of the Iyi clan out of all others? Finally does he really intent to reclaim his honor, or is there something else going on?Told in a dizzying array of flashbacks and flash-forwards, Harakiri is not a leisurely movie to watch while folding laundry. It demands the attention of the viewer and weaves a complex tale of Hanshiro Tsugumo's home life after the fall of his clan. He's stricken with the most dire poverty, contemplating his daughter's (Iwashita) sale as a concubine and working menial jobs just to get by. His daughter, son-in-law Motome (Ishihama) and infant grandson Kingo are his only solace from a life of dishonor. Their fates become intimately intertwined with Tsugumo and the Iyi clan in unexpected ways and paying close attention to the plot pays off stunningly in the end.In his own quiet and ultimately unsettling way director Masaki Kobayashi strips away the nobility and romanticism commonly associated with feudal Japan. While doing so he implicates the modern audience (at the time the Japanese public circa 1962) in tolerating authoritarianism under the guise of honor. Harakiri recalls and parallels the days of Japanese imperialism and uses a single individual as a means to take apart the misplaced hubris of anyone still beholden to the old guard. Kobayashi himself was drafted in the army during WWII but repeatedly refused promotion beyond that of a private; his own way of fighting corruption, hypocrisy and evil.The film comes to a conclusion so damning and memorable that I dare not ruin the satisfaction of watching it for the first time. Harakiri is an absolute treasure featuring a star turn by Nakadai who first made an indelible mark on Japanese screens in Kobayashi's The Human Condition Trilogy (1959-1961). Here, while playing a character much older than himself, he still has a certain inner- turmoil that channels James Dean with a strong baritone. Finally there's Kobayashi's masterful direction which watches pensively and almost perversely as the jigsaw pieces fall in place.","

"PimpinAinttEasy","6 February 2016","Dear Masaki Kobayashi, I am not a big fan of Japanese cinema or the Samurai genre. I have watched a few Kurosawas and Ozus and that's it. But things might change with Hara-Kiri which must be one of the greatest revenge films of all time.Your film was was riveting. Objectively speaking, this is one of the best films I've watched in my life. But then I'm a really subjective movie watcher.I really enjoyed the quite beginning. With people walking whisperingly across corridors. I also enjoyed the formal, hierarchical and ritualistic nature of the interactions between various characters and the storytelling. There is something very precise about the way each shot is framed - the men sitting in straight lines ready to attack, the way various objects are placed and also the interiors of the house of Iyi.The first Hara-Kiri scene of Motome Chijiiwa was cruel and sickening. The film is a suspenseful revenge thriller with lots of drama and social commentary.I'm sure the final sword fight scene inspired the one in Old Boy. And this film must have in someway inspired The Hateful Eight - men taking each other on in a really closed space, narrating stories etc.I wasn't that impressed by Tatsuya Nakadai. His beard seemed a bit artificial. I was also a bit bored in the middle when Tsugumo narrates the story of his daughter and her child.But these are minor charges.Best Regards, Pimpin.(9/10)","

"Cosmoeticadotcom","7 June 2012","The film that Harakiri shares the most cinematic DNA with is Kurosawa's The Bad Sleep Well. In a sense, that film is the modern retelling of this film, wherein a vengeance seeking hero plots to destroy his tormentors, only to have him end up dying, as well as having the real truth expunged. But, along with that film, Harakiri never errs by making its politics lead its art around. From the almost exact repetitions of the early actions of Chijiwa and Tsugumo in the Iyi house, to the repetition of the samurai armor to start and end the film, there is no doubt that politics is merely a weapon in the artistic arsenal; it is not its raison d'etre. But, the film also shares much artistry and narrative technique in common with Kurosawa's more placid Ikiru, which also has a large portion of its ending consist of characters relating flashbacks of what happened to the film's lead character. That this dialogue intensity occurs in a samurai film is unusual, but only at first blush, since Harakiri is, in reality, as much of a samurai film as Stanley Kubrick's Paths Of Glory can be called a 'war' film. And, like films like The Wild Bunch and Once Upoin A Time In The West, Harakiri ends with a symbolic foreshadow of the future of the nation it's set in. It is no happenstance that the rogue ronin Tsugumo is not felled by another's sword, but only by guns, for that was the way the Tokugawa Shogunate, the ultimate bad guy in this film, was to fall almost 240 years later.The Human Condition ultimately missed out on greatness because of its length and overarching ambition, which sometimes obfuscated points that should have rung clarion. Harakiri does not suffer that ill. It is a deft lightning strike at its target, and as such delivers a killer blow. It also shows that Japan's filmic legacy, in the 20th Century, was more than its Big Three directors, Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, and Kenji Mizoguchi. Masaki Kobayashi seems to be every bit their equal, and, along with Kon Ichikawa, Hiroshi Teshigahara, Shohei Imammura, Nagisa Oshima, and Mikio Naruse, the middle part of the last century seems to have been, for Japanese film, one of the most Golden of Golden Ages any country has experienced in any art form. Bravo!","

"sharky_55","29 March 2016","The first shot of Harakiri is an imposing suit of samurai armour, seated on a bench amongst cinematic coils of smoke in the air. I say seating, because despite its hollowness, it's posture is imposingly life-like, almost as if at the call of war it would come to life and march off to battle. This must be how the Ii clan see this glorious suit of armour; even in peacetime it is more than just a tool for means of driving back enemies, but a symbol for honour, strength, loyalty and absolute morality. Of course as they prosper, the peacetime has released many ronin, now master-less and without a trade or living, into the wild wandering. This is really a film for a repeat watch. On first impression, Motome's pleas seem a little self-fulfilling, because why would a samurai committed to seppuku want a two day respite if they have renounced everything and are ready to die? His actual act of seppuku too, is extremely hard to watch - Kobayashi doesn't need to show actually graphic penetration because Ishihama's agony is so anguishing to witness. And yet, there is a hint of comeuppance, because it seems phony that a samurai would carry around a fake, bamboo version of his livelihood. On a second watch, these scenes are filled with such a tragic desperation once we know the back-story. The blunt, ironic cruelty of the bamboo strikes becomes heartbreaking because he has already sold his real blades for his family - what is a samurai without his blade? We know without a doubt he would return in two days this time. Doubly so, Hanshiro weeps because he has kept his own blade, foolishly holding onto a past relic much like the witnesses around him do so. Kobayashi has maintained such a steady, tense rhythm throughout the two hours and 13 minutes. Not once is there a line of misplaced dialogue, or a glance that was not filled with the appropriate amount of venom. We see one 'extortion' attempt, and then another from Hanshiro, so of course we await some sort of twist or connection. There is no sense of contrivance when he delays the act, no sense of artificial direction behind these characters. Tatsuya Nakadai is effortless. He has the knack for transforming so seamlessly into his character and becoming every ounce of them - here it is in his blank, almost traumatised expression as he narrates; it could not be more immediately obvious that this is a man who has lost everything. And then there is the little remaining spark underneath that drives this tale of revenge (his cackles as he bemusedly wonders on the fate of three men he has already taken care of), although it seems more vital to expose the Ii clan for the facade that they uphold. The framing device of the narration of the guest book is what seals it. It simultaneously empowers and suppresses the events of the film; even as we witness the despair of Saito, having his pretense so viciously and comprehensively demolished, he quickly rewrites the history books because he has that power (there's a cruel irony to the way he orders the forced seppuku of the three disgraced warriors - the noble ritual being marred). That stirring, dramatic duel in the windswept plains, gone. That desperate, climatic battle, where we might conventionally expect a one-man massacre and a little poetic justice, gone. And even as he attempts to go out on his own terms, Hanshiro is shot by a modernised death-dealer. It recalls Kurosawa's Yojimbo, in which it was actually Nakadai who wielded the gun and brought forth the end of the age of samurai. But here, it becomes a more potent, universally symbolic end. This cruel world does not bend to sentiment. Appearances must be upheld, even sometimes in the face of moral transgression. Hanshiro smashes the suit of armour, but it is gleaming and whole again soon. But it is of course a hollow ideal. All the honour in the world could not materialise a decent man to fill its shoes.","

"francescopiogrimaldi","17 May 2022","Hara-kiri is a story that seems to start having already finished, with a Ronin who chooses to die.And it is in that moment, when you realize the protagonist's concrete desire to pass away, that you wonder how such a story can go on, when in fact a surrender appears at the gates of the Iyi family.And it is in that moment that the direction of Kobayashi, with its wonderful and tragic aesthetics, together with the script by Hashimoto, decides to tell you the story of that story that you had seen up to that moment.Step by step you understand, through an alternation of delicate and studied narrative lines, able to load every single shot with drama and to denounce that Japanese system of the 17th century that still persists to this day.That social paradox, made up of abuses of power and arrogance by the 'Lords', which takes away dignity from humble people, the same ones who will then be condemned to judgment and labels. Tarnish the memory of a person considered 'nobody' by others, when he/she, on the other hand, was loved and loved by the people who surrounded him/her.Hara-kiri is not just a film about Samurai, it is a film that tells about everyday life and how this is then inexorably declined for a system that works badly, that makes you remain alone, that kills even before a Katana with bamboo blade pierces you, with prying eyes and humiliation from those who believe themselves superior to such an extent that they can teach an exemplary lesson.Thanks Kobayashi, you are the origin of the films I loved. Your cinematographic and at times theatrical direction is shocking, capable of making me fall in love with cinema again with a single zoom or with a single connection of gaze.","

"net_orders","16 July 2016","Viewed on DVD. Restoration = ten (10) stars. This is a melodramatic tale set in Japan's early 1600's. It was a time of major societal disruption when unemployed samurai (known as ""ronin"") became a major problem with the ""peaceful"" unification of Japan under one emperor. Ronin lacked few (if any) skills transferable to civilian life. Their rigid adherence to the ""samurai code of honor"" did not help matters. They become dependent on handouts (sometimes coerced and gained by trickery). The director spins a story to illustrate how a military honor code ingrained over hundreds of years can rapidly become dysfunctional and of little practical use when the zeitgeist changes. The point being that outside of military life and its sponsors, the samurai code is really a ""facade."" Direction is seamless and creative: most of the film uses a single set, but the viewer scarcely notices this and is rarely bored (the movie, however, is a bit too long). Acting by Tatsuya Nakadai is a wonder to behold, and arguably the best brought to the ""classical"" Japanese cinema. The score is stark (mostly consisting of what sounds like a single got-tan), but effective. Cinematography (black and white, wide screen) is excellent with scene lighting adding much to driving the film's theme home to the viewer. Set decoration is appropriately sparse with many interiors either shot on location or carefully recreated in a studio setting. Subtitles leave a lot to be desired. They are usually too long with the title writer taking great liberties when translating line readings. Once again Criterion restoration engineers seem to take delight in harassing the viewer when s/he tries to turn on/off subtitles (you never know what to expect until restarting the film).

"grantss","26 May 2019","A samurai, Hanshiro Tsugumo, arrives at the house of the Iyi Clan with an unusual request. Due to his circumstances, he wishes to commit harakiri, ritual suicide, in the courtyard of the house. Turns out this is not such an unusual request: the clan has had such requests before, though the requestor's intentions weren't always honourable. The Clan elder tells Tsugumo the story of the last samurai who made the request and how that ended. Will he still go through with it?Not your average samurai drama. Slow-burning, plot-filled and relatively light on action, this movie will come as a bit of a surprise to most. This doesn't make it less interesting though. In fact, it makes it better.Instead of a basic plot that's just an excuse for heap of well-choreographed action scenes, the plot here is great, and quite poignant. The action is held back until the end, heightening the anticipation. The action scenes themselves are quite realistic - none of the ridiculous Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon stuff - and have a plausible outcome.On the negative side, the slow-burn does get drawn out a touch too long. In addition, in the end there's no clear message - the conclusion is a bit flat.Overall, a great movie.","

"VikingBurialService","7 February 2022","To me, this is the greatest slow-build of suspense in any movie ever. It's like watching an Alfred Hitchcock movie, but it's a samurai period piece. It breaks the expectations of its genre by focusing more on dialogue than sword fighting. In a lot of ways, it feels like watching a horror movie.Story/Plot/Pacing: Basically, a masterless samurai shows up at a daimyo in Edo asking to commit Hara-Kiri in their courtyard. Right off the bat the music and the story clue you in that there's more history and motivations at play, and throughout the movie the tension between the samurai and the other members of the daimyo builds. The only slow-ish part is in the middle, when he's telling his family's story. It drags on a little, but I can excuse it as slowly building anticipation for what's going to happen, especially on the second viewing.Visuals/Cinematography: The set/costume design is great, but what really stands out is the camera work. Almost all the shots are stable, and the camera almost never moved. In the select few moments it does, it only helps build the tension.Characters: Good. Not 'outstanding' but good. I think the main character is the best - he plays a grieving/maddened father/grandfather well, and the way his voice switches volume/power keeps me on edge. The other actors did a fine job. No standouts, but nothing that dragged me out of the moment.Dialogue: Can't speak perfectly to this, since it's subtitled. There's plenty of exposition, but that's more common in Japanese films I think, and it seems to work here.Theme/Tone: Obviously honor, and the contradiction between doing what is morally honorable versus doing what is honorable based on written/societal codes. Very critical of authority.Score: The score isn't memorable (and I can't find it anywhere) but it fits perfectly with the movie. Basically it's traditional Japanese instruments that play sharply/suddenly whenever there's tension. It's used sparingly, and contrasts well with the long moments of silence or dialogue.","

"gbill-74877","30 November 2016","What is more dishonorable, out of work Samurai (Ronin) asking a clan to commit hara-kiri in their courtyard out of a desire to gain employment, with no intention of committing the act, or those in houses being cruel to them? When the country dishonors its Samurai, and they are driven to acts of desperation, leading to cruelty and further dishonor, the country spirals, and this movie set in 17th century seems to reflect decline in then present day (1962) Japan.The movie is quite beautiful visually, with traditional Japanese architecture and at one point a swaying bamboo forest framed beautifully by director Masaki Kobayashi. The story is taut and works on many levels, first and foremost as a vengeance with honor tale, which might remind you of an American Western, including a couple of epic battle scenes. It also has the individual man, disillusioned and saying that the Samurai code he lives by is a façade, and yet acting honorably, against a multitude misled by corrupt leaders. It's one against many in a battle that is timeless and certainly relevant today, and whose results are sadly akin to the entropy of the universe. ""Who can know the depths of another man's heart?"" the Samurai asks, signaling a need for empathy. Indeed.","

"apollo5861","7 January 2003","Little did I know that when my teacher said that this movie would be one of the best, if not the best, movies I have ever seen, that he would be telling the truth. I thought the movie was great. I thought `Hara-kiri' was very well written and well developed. I originally thought I was in for another Asian samurai movie filled with sword swinging, kung fu action, but it was so much more than that. It was a movie that shined a light on Japanese traditions and the hypocrisy of those in authoritative places. I really enjoyed the movie. It was one of those movies that if you fell to sleep on it or weren't paying attention you couldn't just fall back in line and think you could still follow the story. There was so much going on that you just wanted to give it all your attention. I enjoyed it because even though it `Die Hard' action packed, it still captured you. To one who knows that `hara-kiri' refers to suicide, you would probably assume that the movie would be grim and coarse. However, it was absolutely the opposite. It was a movie that really helped me to appreciate the strong and noble traditions of ancient Japan.","

"jose-cruz53","29 January 2013","This is a very powerful film, one that I will never forget indeed. Made by one of Japan's finest directors, Harakiri is a near-masterpiece of film. It has a few flaws in my mind, such as a rather poor/unrealistic characterization and stiff acting, that somewhat reduces the overall quality of this work of art. Still, despite those problems, the overall experience remained very powerful and memorable. Indeed, this is one of those movies that I will never forget.One thing that I love about Japanese movies is the fact that they are slow paced and allow the film to really breathe though. Unlike Hollywood movies, which tend to be too fast paced and therefore do not allow the viewer to fully immerse himself into the film.","

"kareem-1","7 August 2006","Now while I've seen way more than my share of great Japanese samurai flicks, this is the only one I've seen so far that delves head-long into the Japanese culture of ""perfection"", honor, code and family. As the main character tells his story you feel more for his pain than nearly Kurosawa movie. For years, I thought Akira Kurosawa was the end all for truly great cinema, but after seeing Kobayashi's opus in Seppuku, it is obvious that 1960's Japanese Cinema had two masters.Seppuku is certainly one of those flicks that makes you say ""Oh SH*T"" halfway through. A deep and enriching story that just keeps getting better as more of the movie is revealed to you. While it doesn't reveal itself to you in a normal unraveling, but rather with a wonderfully told and filmed flashback (while admiringly very long and drawn out - even characters in the film call it so).Everything from the beautiful camera work to the acting delivery is absolutely superb. The close-ups within the flick actually deliver a wealth of information about the scenes that spoken words could only touch on. Truly a masterpiece and worth the wait from Netflix.","

"sandnair87","18 January 2016","Samurai films, like westerns, need not be familiar genre stories. They can expand to contain stories of ethical challenges and human tragedy. 'Harakiri', a shining example of the kind, is about one samurai who takes his time to create an unanswerable dilemma for the elder of a powerful clan. By playing strictly within the rules of Bushido Code which governs the conduct of all samurai, he lures the powerful leader into a situation where sheer naked logic leaves him humiliated before his retainers.The story is set in a time when feudal Japan is at peace, and starving out-of-work samurai beg to perform ritual suicide or 'hara-kiri' at the mansions of powerful clans - a request they hope will lead to a charitable pittance or a menial job. One such lone ronin arrives at the temple of Lord Iyi and asks to use the courtyard to perform honorable ritual self-disembowelment, hara-kiri or seppuku. That seems like the beginning and the end of this movie, all in one: a checkmate. But director Masaki Kobayashi instead constructs a masterful chess game, filled with many carefully constructed moves, each arranged to fit in a particular place - it's glorious to behold!Thus, it would be foolish to give away too much. But the ronin Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) has chosen this particular temple for a very grievous personal reason. His hara-kiri is postponed when, kneeling on the white-sheeted death platform, he requests one after another, three separate house retainers serve as seconds to cut off his head. All three so indisposed as to be unable to attend, the ronin then begs a moment of time to tell his story. Like a brilliant player, he leaves out crucial details until the most opportune moments.The movie openly depicts vanity and corruption among the samurai class, showing that the Lord is more concerned with his reputation than with actual samurai honor. The film has a steady, hypnotic momentum; Kobayashi, wrings as much drama out of facial twitches as he does out of sword fights which are all elegantly composed and photographed to reflect the values it contains. He's helped immensely by Nakadai's molten central performance and the spare, disquieting music. Using superb architectural compositions, Mr. Kobayashi achieves a sort of visual mesmerization that is suitable to the curious nightmare mood.In the end, ""Harakiri"" goes well beyond the usual genre trappings to beautifully underline its recurring theme - that fanatic adherence to codes of honor, by granting them a value greater than life itself, sets up a situation where humanitarian values are forbidden.","

"pere-25366","10 April 2019","Though the act of Seppuku, or ""Harakari"", was abolished in 1868, it was for a long time the true test of a samurai's honor and nobility. In Seppuku (1962), the ritual shows us humanity in its most raw and vulnerable form; perhaps, it is just before death when one's truest colors shine through. The film is a masterclass in portraying the human condition while showcasing some of the best cinematography and direction I've ever seen in a film. Literally every frame (with its perfect lighting, blocking and composition) is like a painting come to life, just perfect. Masaki Kobayashi paces this film perfectly and keeps you engrossed with one of the most beautiful and incisive pieces of human drama I've ever seen. Once the film receives about 1,000 or so more ratings on IMDb, you'll see this gem shoot up to the top 50 easily. It's truly one of the most beautifully crafted films ever made; What a masterpiece...","

An honorable end to this fate under the samurai code is ritual suicide, or hara-kiri (self-inflicted gutting). An older warrior, Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) seeks admission to the home of a feudal lord to commit the act. There, he learns of the fate of his son-in-law, a young samurai who sought work at home, but was savagely forced to commit traditional hara-kiri in a painful way with a blind bamboo blade. In flashbacks, the samurai tells the tragic story of his son-in-law and how he was forced to sell his royal sword to support his sick wife and son.

In terms of editing, the flashbacks fit in perfectly with none of the fade-outs of Hollywood at its schmaltziest. The acting is absolutely wonderful. No histrionics here. But the music is phenomenal! It uses Japanese instruments (with percussion) and is minimal but essential. The duel scene on the plain has to be seen to be believed.

Although set during the twilight of the samurai era, Harakiri has  a story which can shake the norms of any modern culture anywhere in the world.  The secure but lonely life of an old warrior and his daughter are like a house built on sand and when the wind of change blows there is a stench from the  injustice and apathy from other samurai who stilll sleep in the illusion of their usefulness.   And no, this film is not about revenge, swords and just killing, in fact the action is so concentrated and sudden it's role is to  jar the audience out of the spell the director and actors and actresses cast and screams ""this is it, it's the end, it's real, and you'll remember every second forever'.","

"Sergeant_Tibbs","22 September 2014","I usually don't like samurai movies. Even Kurosawa doesn't do it for me. I just can't sink into their ways of life and the world of 17th century Japan. However, Masaki Kobayashi's Harakiri totally subverts and questions everything they stand for in a compelling way. It's a study of the human condition in samurai form, naturally from the director of the epic saga The Human Condition, of which I need to finish after being impressed by the first part. It's a dissection of the metaphysical ideas of honour that bind the traditions of these men. While they try to commit to formalities, in the face of conflict they find it impossible. The story unravels like a psychological thriller although it's largely formed of flashbacks and talking but the connections that are drawn and the way the film blossoms to its explosive final 15 minutes is extraordinary. A suicide narrative like this is difficult, what are the stakes and what are the motives? Harakiri keeps you guessing, thanks to the incredible performances and when you feel like you've got it figured out, the whole picture changes. With its stark widescreen cinematography and disconcerting score, its technical aspects bolster the experience. It's a film that works on all levels, Harakiri is certainly the best Japanese film I've seen so far.9/10","

"kaaffilm","27 March 2023","""Harakiri"" (1962), directed by Masaki Kobayashi, is a powerful and gripping tale that explores themes of honor, duty, and the corrupting nature of power. Set in the 17th century, the film tells the story of a ronin, or masterless samurai, who arrives at the estate of a powerful lord seeking to perform harakiri, a ritual suicide, as a means of protesting the lord's oppressive regime.From the opening scene, ""Harakiri"" is an intense and emotionally charged film that masterfully weaves together the past and present to tell a poignant story about the struggles of marginalized people in feudal Japan. Kobayashi's direction is impeccable, drawing out strong performances from the entire cast and bringing to life the complex characterizations of the film's protagonists and antagonists.One of the film's greatest strengths is its ability to challenge traditional notions of samurai honor and morality, presenting a starkly realistic portrayal of the brutal realities of life in feudal Japan. The film's themes of social injustice and political corruption remain relevant today, making ""Harakiri"" a timeless masterpiece that continues to resonate with audiences around the world.Overall, ""Harakiri"" is a deeply moving and thought-provoking film that showcases Kobayashi's masterful storytelling and brings to life a fascinating and complex period in Japanese history. It is a must-see for fans of Japanese cinema, and for anyone interested in exploring the depths of human nature and the power of redemption.","

He comes to the home of a feudal clan to ask permission to commit seppuku within the courtyard.

All he has is a blade made of bamboo. It's a brutal painful event. Nevertheless, Hanshiro insists on continuing with his seppuku and then he reveals that he did indeed know Motome.The first recollection is actually quite compelling. It catches my attention culminating in one of the most memorable horrific scenes. The rest of the movie can't really compare. It's another series of recollections and it's not as compelling.

"SaidNDone","20 September 2020","The first thought I had after finishing Harakiri was that I had just watched a Greek tragedy. Every aesthetic element of Harakiri from the empty scenery to the haunting soundtrack is stripped bare, sharpening the viewer's focus onto the human elements in Tsugumo's description of how his family was led to its fate by the hypocrisy of the Shogunate's hierarchy.The brilliance of the movie isn't in its relatively simplistic plot, but rather in the way it makes use of Tsugumo's framed story to detail the impact social codes have on those left behind by society's unfeeling march forward.As Tsugumo tells his story to an increasingly hostile audience, each scene serves to add further evidence to his point - which is the inherent cruelty in applying an unfeeling Samurai ""honor"" code to a messy reality. This goes on until the final act, in which he brilliantly exposes the tie between honor and the Samurai's most sacred symbols as a facade.In the final act, Tsugumo breaks the Imagawa Clan's self-righteous view of themselves with two actions. The first occurs in the final moments of his frame story, where he inverts the traditional relationship between a Samurai's sword and honor - turning Chijiwa's Bamboo sword, which was previously a symbol of dishonor into a symbol of familial loyalty/love. The second occurs after the Imagawa Clan rejects Tsugumo's message - as their leaders are shown to be dishonorable according to their own honor code and the clan's ancestral armor is desecrated during the final fight, which culminates in the Clan resorting to the use of firearms (over their sacred swords) to take down Tsugumo.But as mentioned earlier, society grinds on, and the now disgraced clan cover up both Tsugumo's tragedy and their own dishonor with the stroke of a pen. The question is - will the Clan heed Tsugumo's advice when the wheels of history inevitably turn them to Ronin?","

"dr_foreman","22 January 2008","While some so-called classics leave me cold, ""Harakiri"" (as it's known in the USA) really fires my imagination. This is a rare movie - the kind that I just can't stop recommending to people.Much of the film's appeal is based on surprising narrative twists, so I'm reluctant to delve too deeply into the plot here. But the basic setup is as follows - Japan has entered a time of peace, and consequently many samurai are unemployed and suffering in extreme poverty. Some samurai develop a ploy of threatening to commit suicide, but only so they can get sympathetic handouts of food and money from rich families. The film explores what happens when that ploy backfires in a very serious way.Director Masaki Kobayashi paces the film very slowly - by comparison, many Kurosawa and even Ozu films are breezy, and of course contemporary American films move approximately 800x faster. However, I am never really bored while watching ""Harakiri""; the film slowly builds toward a (very rewarding) climax, while filling in the characters' compelling backstories. In short, this movie requires - but pays back - patience. Stick with it, and you'll be rewarded with interesting revelations and even some exciting (and surprisingly violent) fight scenes.Due to its unusual blend of action, emotion and social commentary, ""Harakiri"" has shot right up my list of favorite films. I'm tempted to describe it as a Tarantino-style film, only with more of a conscience and a sophisticated worldview. But I suppose that any such comparisons between ""Harakiri"" and American movies must be broad and a little crude. Kobayashi's film stands on its own, of course, and is well worth seeking out for any cinema fan.","

Probably almost half of the movie is flashbacks or a story in a story, but when it's pulled off, it's just the most intriguing thing to watch. It's easy to jump to conclusions in this movie, but it's like your whole impression of a character changes every 20 minutes. It's unimaginable as to how much controversy this film caused in Japan, especially coming from a Japanese filmmaker, but it really makes you think about the samurai culture and their position in society. It's truly one of the greatest examples of exploring humanism there is. Every character, even the protagonist, have their flaws that probably cost them a lot, but you're not left not understanding any character. You really can see the story from everyone's very different perspectives. It explores ideas that society never really stops to think about, like when is compassion more important than pride, or how literally should you really take things, and when do you really start abusing power. It doesn't force a message or moral on its audience, but just makes you stop to think about them, and show you what can happen when you take one side of it. You can watch this movie looking for every detailed meaning in it, or just watch it because it's a guy with nothing to lose and a lot of skills, going out for justice. Either way it's great and really a true example of what Japanese culture has brought to filmmaking.","

"svikasha","24 June 2017","The concept of ritual suicide in the form of Harakiri, otherwise known as Seppuku, has captivated western imaginations for centuries. Indeed, the very notion of suicide, for religious or social reasons is viewed with a feeling of disdain within the western mindset. However, ritual suicide held an important ceremonial role for members of the Samurai class in ancient Japan. Viewed as an important component of the Samurai's Bushido warrior code, Harakiri was often used as a punishment but was often done voluntarily as well. It was a matter of honor and upheld the tradition of the warrior code. Harakiri forces the audience to confront the brutality of such a tradition and questions the morality of it. During the film, the main character questions both Bushido and the authenticity of the warrior code. He asserts that Bushido is a mere facade rather than a symbol of discipline. Whether or not these assertions are true, is a question that Harakiri leaves for the audience to decide.During the Edo period of the Tokugawa shogunate in Japan, it was common for master less samurai who were known as Ronin to request to commit harakiri in the palace of feudal lords.In this tradition, a man who goes by the name of Tsugumo Hanshirō requests to commit suicide at a powerful feudal lord's courtyard. Masaki Kobayashi directed this film to start out slow with the old man Hanshirō narrating a story. The story is about how the powerful clan at the courtyard was responsible for the death of Hanshirō's entire family. The old man confronts the powerful feudal clan in such a calm and authoritative manner that the audience is left at the edge of their seats. Hanshirō's daughter was married to a poor Samurai that was so destitute that he had to sell his blade to care for his family. He has a young baby who unfortunately gets sick and becomes desperately in need of medicine. When Hanshirō's son in law came to the Li clan seeking alms for medicine, they chose to punish him for disgracefully giving up his Samurai sword by forcing him to disembowel himself in the Seppuku fashion using the only sword he had left: a dull bamboo katana. After covering the dramatic backstory, the movie masterfully builds up to the final conclusion where Hanshirō uses every last ounce of his Samurai abilities to fight his way into the feudal lord's compound to desecrate his hall. The sheer force of will and determination displayed by Hanshirō's character on-screen is a testament to the acting abilities of Tatsuya Nakadai.Despite being shot in black and white, the film is aesthetically appealing as it depicts idyllic Japanese villages and sword fights in Samurai graveyards. At the climax of the film, the greatest line of the film is spoken. Before the culminating final sword battle, the main character proudly proclaims, ""Motome had indeed gone mad. But I say good for him! I praise him for it. He may have been a samurai, but he was a man of flesh and blood. He could not live on air alone. When he has reached the point of no return, even a man as strong as Motome will go mad trying to protect his family, and I would praise him for it. They'll call him the bamboo ronin. Not only samurai, but townspeople, too, will scoff at his wavering. But let them laugh all they want. Who can fathom the depths of another man's heart?"".","

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","3 July 2020","Essentially a condemning statement on the falsity of the samurai's supposed 'code of honour' and the concept of an 'honourable' death, this slow-burning drama sees a man recount his life as he prepares to take it in a ritualistic 'harakiri' ceremony. The tragedy of 'Harakiri (1962)' is profound and, as it moves from one phase to the next, it manages to emotionally affect in some surprising ways. It's a really layered piece, one with a multitude of intertwining themes and hard-won messages. The few sequences of violence it has are suitably brutal and exciting. They're grounded yet stylish, visceral yet thrilling, devastating yet inevitable. Arguably, the movie's most effective moment is an early example of its eponymous act, as a young man is forced to commit 'seppuku' in an incredibly cruel way. This scene is really difficult to sit through, to be honest, and it becomes even worse when the narrative revisits the reasoning behind its circumstances. The film is slow paced but it isn't boring. It's an interesting, entertaining but heavy affair. 7/10","

"bobcatlew","12 June 2000","""Another one? Is there no end?""So the clan elder of the House of Iyi greets the news that Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) is at his gate with an odd request.  Hanshiro, an old, impoverished, unemployed samurai, seeks use of their mansion to perform harakiri, ceremonial suicide that involves self-disembowlment and is an honorable death for a samurai living in disgrace.But in a time of peace, Japan abounds with ex-warriors who threaten to perform this rite only to extort money from weak-willed clans.  In light of such dishonorable conduct, the House of Iyi has adopted stern measures: Any samurai who threatens to perform this rite at their gate will be forced to do so.  Thus a younger ex-warrior, Motome Chigiiwa, met his fate.  Coming with the same request, this unfortunate youth was forced to carry out the rite with a bamboo sword -- ""an unsightly affair.""  The clan elder would warn the older Hanshiro away with the story of Motome's death, but the old warrior is resolved to die.Things, however, are not what they seem.  Hanshiro seems to have more on his mind than suicide.  And, as he relates his own lifestory to the warriors of Iyi clan, not only are their stern measures called into question, but also the very honor of which they are so proud.Seppuku is an awesome story of revenge told with devastating effect.  By the time you know what the story is really about, you yourself have cast judgement on the characters.  Then things turn on you, and nothing appears as it did before.  In this film a tragic story, great sword duels, haunting atmospheric music, and an exciting final battle combine to form what I think is an overlooked masterpiece.  Director Masaki Kobayashi does to the samurai genre what Sam Pekinpah will later do to the western in The Wild Bunch:  He takes the samurai code and turns it upon its head.  This film is great, and worth every repeated watching.","

"KaceyLeggio","18 June 2014","While ""Harakiri"" was not my first experience with Japanese history, culture or cinema, it was still an impacting and enlightening film. While ruthless in nature, ""Harakiri"" does a wonderful job in conveying the history of ancient Japan, samurais and the Bushido code. While some people's knowledge of samurais only extend as far as the Disney film, ""Mulan"", ""Harakiri"" sheds a great deal of light on the underlying meaning behind the truth, strength and honor of the code. With a protagonist that is both relentless and appealing, ""Harakiri"" delivers special performances all over the board. While it moves a bit slow, there is an undeniable enchantment about this film. The story, while heart-wrenching, is so well done that you come out of it rooting for more. It makes you question history and the way it's perceived, just as I'm sure Mr. Kobayashi intended. With engaging choreography and near-perfect consume and set design, ""Harakiri"" brings you to a place and time that you otherwise may not have known existed. Kobayashi does a wonderful job at conveying the internal struggle between all characters, men whom have an obligation to their families, and those who have one to their code. This film challenges all the elements of revenge, redefinition and ritual. A job very well done.","

"PAL","15 January 1999","This Academy Award winner stands out for the relentless pace that proceeds without a wasted second. A simple tale told by a kneeling man climbs step-by-step from a mystery to an historical metaphor for political lying and cover-ups, with every step along the way a chance for astonishing photography and heart-racing action. I've seen this film a dozen times, in theatres and on television, and every time I am nearly exhausted by the relentless tension and drama -- even while knowing every scene. The photography is unsurpassed for composition and lighting, the direction is flawless. One of the greatest pictures, but hard to find in a theatre or video.

"Ricc0","3 November 2016","Tsugumo Hanshiro, a Samurai with no lord (ronin), goes to the estate of Li clan to commit Harakiri (Japanese ritual suicide), yet a senior counselor there tells him a story about the fate of a younger ronin that came to the clan holding the same request. The story that was intended to scare away Hanshiro only carried him to tell a story of his own and so he did in the oddest fashion. And through flashbacks we learn it and the more we know the more we understand.. the more we feel.. the more we think.Harakiri (1962), that its events are set out between 1619 and 1630 of the Edo period, is a perfect study of the human mind, heart, and soul. It is also a study of the human relations and that of the society and individual..Through its characters and their contradicting personalities you will learn a lot.. Sincerity and hypocrisy, faith and appearances, love and hate, caring and indifference, courage and fear... The social structure: flaws and corruptness.. The society's symbols and traditions: their depth and when they are only a cover. And then there is history: how it happens and then how it is written. This is all one thing about Harakiri and the other aspects that make a film are just as perfect.. the cinematography, soundtrack, acting.. every single aspect.. and the duels we see reminded me of the duels in ""The good, the bad, and the ugly', only that here it's with swords.Truly the film is a masterpiece.. a journey that you should undergo.","

"TheUnholyPeanut","31 March 2023","Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" is a seminal masterpiece of Japanese cinema, a film that examines the complex relationship between honor, tradition, and power in feudal Japan. Released in 1962, the film remains a timeless and thought-provoking exploration of the human condition.At its core, ""Harakiri"" is a film about the futility of the cycle violence and the destructive power of revenge. The film's protagonist, Hanshiro Tsugumo, arrives at the doorstep of a powerful samurai clan, seeking permission to commit ritual suicide (harakiri) on their grounds. But as he tells the story of a former samurai who was forced to commit suicide under similar circumstances, it becomes clear that his request is more than just a simple act of honor, and this unravels into a heartbreaking, tragic tale.The film's exploration of the samurai code and the role of honor in Japanese society is both complex and nuanced. Through its portrayal of the rituals and customs surrounding harakiri, ""Harakiri"" examines the ways in which tradition can be used to justify violence and oppression.The script and dialogue of ""Harakiri"" are sharp and incisive, with each word carefully chosen to convey the complex emotions and motivations of the characters. The film's characters are richly drawn and fully realized, with each one possessing their own distinct personality and backstory. It is a character study of a man's raging, internal conflict, not an action-packed samurai flick like you might expect, but it is just as thrilling and even more provocative.The cinematography and directing of ""Harakiri"" are nothing short of masterful. The film's use of wide shots and close-ups is particularly effective in conveying the emotional and psychological states of the characters. The contrast between the opulent surroundings of the samurai clan and the desolate, poverty-stricken world outside serves as a powerful metaphor for the social and economic divides of feudal Japan.The acting in ""Harakiri"" is uniformly excellent, with each actor delivering a nuanced and powerful performance. Tatsuya Nakadai, in particular, delivers a standout performance as the film's protagonist, Hanshiro Tsugumo, bringing depth and complexity to a character struggling with the weight of tradition and the desire for revenge, which is a complex and tragic conflict. The rest of the cast also gives excellent performances as well, bringing depth to the characters and script. I particularly enjoyed Tetsuo Tamba's performance as well.The film is incredibly deep, it's themes provocative and powerful. For one, ""Harakiri"" can be seen as a critique of feudalism and the ways in which the ruling class uses tradition to justify their power and privilege. The contrast between the beautiful architecture of the Samurai Clan to the squalor and sheer misery of the peasants highlights this in Feudal Japan. Kobayashi also uses Feudal Japan to critique Post-WW2 Japan in a variety of ways, including how tradition can be used for violence and hatred, something incredibly relevant at this time. We see Tsugumo challenge tradition and the status quo in many ways throughout the film, which culminates in a bloody finale.Ultimately, ""Harakiri"" is a powerful and thought-provoking cinematic experience, a film that challenges the viewer to question their own beliefs about honor, tradition, and power. Its exploration of the samurai code and the rituals surrounding harakiri is both complex and nuanced, and its characters are richly drawn and fully realized. Masaki Kobayashi's masterful direction, combined with outstanding performances from the film's cast, make ""Harakiri"" a timeless masterpiece of Japanese cinema.","

"jamesrupert2014","24 September 2016","Harakiri tells the story of vengeance with a minimum of action (but a surprising amount of blood for a early '60s film). The flashback based story is well told, Tatsuya Nakadai is excellent as the down-and-out samurai slowly unravelling his tale, and the black and white film is beautiful to watch, especially the last showdown. The Samurai film genre lends itself to comparison to the American ""western"" and, with its emphasis on the plight of the destitute ronin, Harakiri could be likened to the early revisionist oaters. Highly recommended, especially before or after a viewing of one of the Japanese versions of ""47 Ronin"" (personally, I like the lengthy, understated 1941 version).","

There is no point writing anything about the plot, actually two reviews (including IMDb's one) I read afterward reveal too much of it. I think the director would like to create a progressive change to the viewer's attitude concerning ""honor"" and ""moral"". Being Black&White and almost theatrical, it leads you to think rather than watch enchanted by the picture. It is not really a samurai action film, neither a film like ""Hero"" or ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (both of which I liked so much, for different reasons), although some scenes have common elements. I know not everybody will like it, it is a bit slow and also cruel but it has a point for both. The picture was a little blur at times, but I don't know if it was the film's or the cinema's fault. Anyway, it's a 42-year-old film, so that's better than we can expect!During the intermission,I was wondering which century I live in, so much was I incorporated in the atmosphere! PS. Do Japanese people really talk with their mouth almost closed?","

The movie is pretty boring in the beginning, but it soon evolves into a masterpiece, but it isn`t as good as ""The 7 Samurai"". ""Harakiri"" is a way for a Samurai to commit suicide in an honorable way, so it isn`t difficult to understand that the movie will be about Japanese warriors killing themselves with their sword. It is a movie that captures the atmosphere of Japan in the 1700`s and the sword-fights are magnificent.  Remember that this movie is from 1962, so don`t expect the fight-scenes to be as flashy as in ""The Matrix"". ""Harakiri"" is definetely worth seeing. 9/10","

"bladefd","10 January 2024","Harakiri (1962) is a Japanese film that takes place in 1630, and it is a story of the Samurai code of honor and family. Harakiri (also called seppuku) is the ritualistic suicide once employed by Samurai warriors to die while keeping their honor intact. A Samurai, Hanshiro Tsugumo, travels to the House of a rival clan Iyi, asking for a place to commit seppuku. Clans would permit such requests because it was an honorable final act for a Samurai to save his honor in their house. At that time, Samurai often arrived under a false pretense of committing seppuku but leaving with gold. The clan believes Tsugumo arrived under such false pretense. The story unravels from that point into a flashback of another Samurai, Motome Chijiiwa, who had arrived under such false pretense. I can't say anything more about the relationship between Tsugumo and Chijiiwa without spoiling the story.The filming style is interesting. It is depicted using dialogue and several flashbacks as it draws out the plot. The first hour is slow-paced, but the story picks up pace thereafter. It is ultimately a pushback on the Samurai code and the hypocrisy behind it.Would I recommend this? Yes, I believe it was very well done. The directing often reminded me of Akira Kurosawa's works. I would think the director of this film was inspired by Kurosawa. However, it's probably not for everyone because of the pacing, style, and lack of much action (until the last half hour). Not everyone likes subtitles either.","

"thespeos","29 May 2021","I'm sure there's some rationale as to the great reviews, but I do not share them.I don't have a lot of patience for most samurai film as they tend to:1) Take forever to develop, and ""develop"" is a questionable state
2) The cultural and era often make no sense (in contemporary American terms)
3) They take the traditions and bushido code far too seriously
4) They're absurdly brutish masculine, almost like animalsThis film takes a different approach in that 90% of the film is story-telling, and the sword play is almost ancillary. It's a nice change, but ultimately boring.STORY: If you've watched Japanese (samurai) film then the story is old. It's as simple as vengeance sought for some injustice, which isn't a bad thing. But after awhile, this becomes boring, if not useless. There is ZERO CHARACTER development here, which seems inconsistent with the (seeming) intent of the director. But I felt almost nothing for the characters, or their travail.ACTING: Again, as to Japanese samurai film, it's fine. But there's NO acting that stands up, let alone out. Just dull, flat, mechanical. Aside from the perfunctory grunting, the dialogue is predictable.TEMPO: Very, very, very slow. Not atypical for the sub-genre, but brutally slow.CINEMATOGRAPHY: The scenery is lack-luster, but at least tidy. Props are OK, but sparse. Sound is OK, but nothing interesting.DIRECTING: This same director churns this stuff out on script and cue. For the sub-genre fine, but doubt there's much transferable skill to other film genre.Overall, a slow-moving, run-of-the-mill samurai film. Dull. Pointless.","

"lastliberal-853-253708","29 November 2011","I think it was in Zorro, the Gay Blade, that George Hamilton said, ""The Lord must love the poor because he made so many of them."" In this outstanding film, it is the struggles of the poor that are the prime focus, and the way in which they continue to maintain their honor and pride as they are forced to take menial tasks or watch their loved ones die due to lack of money.It is also timely as the poor we are talking about were the former Samurai who were forced into poverty as their jobs were eliminated by the Shogunate.These newly poor then, as now, are demonized as unworthy, ignoring the fact that it was society that made them poor, and society that made them unable to retain other work except for the most menial tasks. They were often reduced to begging, and that is how the story opens.The story is not what is seems at first as we soon find there is much more than we first imagined.Make no mistake, it includes some great action that one expects to see in a Samurai film, but that is not as important as Shinobu Hashimoto's dialog. It was captivating.The film is an indictment of the class system and it's so-called ""honor."" It also shows the mentality that lead to World War II. It is a film that will captivate you and anger you.The acting is superb, the score amazingly good, and the black and white cinematography first rate.Tatsuya Nakadai (Ran, Yojimbo) was outstanding in the lead role, and Masaki Kobayashi's direction ranks him among the best in Japan.","

"anirguha-60-851453","26 March 2022","Harakiri. By Kobayasahi is undoubtedly one of the best movies on Samurai genre The way it deviates from the other movies is that instead of showing the valour and values of a Samurai warrior it shows the futility of this valour and code of conduct and emptiness of its values. Although this is a period movie from 1630, the universality of the theme can never be missed. This questions the present days' idea of honour that is expected from the soldiers and civilians alike and unfaltering loyalty towards the codes of conduct that bind them together. This movie challenges this very idea.The cinematography, set design, actings, musical scores are excellent. But these aspects do not make this movie special.

"rauldiul","22 December 2012","This is a genuine, unique and sincere samurai film. The flawless direction Kobayashi presents to us depletes all criticisms. The prudent pace the story moves in is in itself the depiction of the samurai society: the extreme respect, the omnipresent rituals of courtesy, the will to listen to your foes, the patience.The key in the greatness of this film -my favourite samurai film, personally- lies in the meticulous (negative reviewers would have to say here: ""painstaking"") representation of the relationships between these people who live for and by an immutable code of honor,and how the story ends up telling us that, in the end -for better or for worse- man is above any social principle or code. Hanshiro Tsumogo (the main character) is, after all, only demanding an apology for the way the young Motome Chijiiwa was treated, but we see how arrogance stands in the way of the samurai code, and he's left empty-handed.On the other side of the coin, Motome Chijiiwa's act of love for his wife and son, which involves his total humiliation, again defies the samurai code.""After all, this thing we call samurai honor is ultimately nothing but a facade."" says Hanshiro Tsugumo after recounting his story. Not facade in the sense of fictitious, but in the sense of superficial.

To deter him, a senior counselor tells him the story about a young ronin who is looking for a way to commit seppuku, but set of circumstances has made his death a slow, painful and humiliating. Despite this warning a poor ronin insists that he has never heard that story and says that he has no intention of leaving their palace alive. After a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, the ronin is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. Coincidentally, he has chose three samurai who have participated in the ritual of the unfortunate young ronin from the counselor's story. However, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness. The ronin has laughed ironically and started his shocking confession...This is a very dramatic and tragic story with a very strong final climax. That ritualistic form of suicide is further reinforce the impression of a dark atmosphere. The main villain is a certain kind of a corrupt lord. A desperate and poor hero slowly serves his revenge, with the intent to humiliate and embarrass his opponents. An ancient tradition, political conflicts and shattered pride follow his painful confession. Mr. Kobayashi has enriched a tense situation with a vivid and sad retrospectives. The final battle is truly magnificent, even an occasional shred of theatricality has its role. Characterization is pretty good. Tatsuya Nakadai (Tsugumo Hanshirō) has offered an excellent performance as a desperate and poor, but focused and brave ronin.The brutality and an attack in the agony give us an entirely new expression of the ancient samurai world.","

It forces introspection and doesn't punish you for it, rather you have to come to terms with the fact that you condemned a man with out knowing his story. At least that was how it occurred in my case. Although slow at first, this film picks up momentum and easily enthralls the viewer with a magnificent showcase of storytelling.

One of these penniless ronin samurai asks for assistance at a samurai house that remains rich in the martial tradition.In this tale, the plot lead me towards one conclusion, before gradually but steadily send me in the other direction. This masterful misdirection only makes the film's violent and vengeful conclusion all the more spectacular. I will never again view samurai honor culture in the same light.","

"Greenstar99","25 November 2014","First of all let me tell u guys what exactly is Harakiri.It is also known as Seppuku in Japan.Harakiri is a form of Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment.It is reserved only for samurai.I saw this movie few days back and i must say am surprised how well this movie is made,everything is just perfect from story to acting.This story shows the ugly truth of life.It shows sometimes man can go and do anything for the sake of the family and sometimes the family is the only thing he got and once lost the will to live also gets away. It shows whatever the traditions are good or bad but family is the most important thing in life.It shows some traditions managed by bad leaders can come to very bad endings.I would recommend this movie for everyone and am sure u will like this classic samurai flick.","

"ragingbull_2005","10 May 2020","Technically brilliant, narrative wise unpredictable, superbly acted, Harakiri (Japanese) is rightly considered as one of the best films of all time, across all languages.The setup is so tantalizing. A samurai turns up at a grand lord's home, searching for a place to commit suicide. The counselor at the grand lord's place tells him of another samurai who had come a month back with the same request and that sets the ball rolling.If this movie were in Technicolor and I were to not tell you the year in which it was released, it would be difficult for general audience to guess the year/decade of its release as there is not much, if anything, that seems dated.The one drawback for me was one of the sword fighting scenes that lacks the intensity of modern action sequences. However, it more than makes up for it by the time it ends.Very highly recommended. You would be enthralled by its direction and it's narrative trajectory. Truly one of the greatest of all time","

"downder55","27 April 2023","So close to perfection? Nothing is perfect, but if this Japanese film isn't close enough then nothing is. Harakiri is thematically brilliant, exuding tremendous emotion that leaves one staggered come end credits. I would love to say why, but it would only ruin the experience. Kobayashi had guts to deliver the sociopolitical stalemates he made within this film and I have deep respect for him having done it. Of course there is more to this film besides its commentary. Its shots and cinematography are gorgeous in every sense of the way and the acting is superb. Most importantly it's narration and story is seamless while its climactic rise is one of the best I've experienced from any film. I don't just hand out perfect ratings, but a masterpiece such as this film deserves it.","

"diego1235467","7 June 2011","This is a fantastic film that questions what honor truly means, and what it meant for the Samurai. It presents us with a rich and thrilling story that has us glued to our seats as we follow different Samurai through an unwinding mystery surrounding the death of a young Ronin.The film gives us a glimpse into the less than ideal lives of the Samurai, and shows us the truly human issues that they had to deal with, like family and loss, instead of simply showing battle scenes. The film is about the priorities that a man has to set for himself, and the conflicting values between the Bushido code, and the family life of a samurai.Through it's form of story structure, the film also teaches us to never judge a book by its cover, by changing who we perceived to be the protagonist originally. This structure, on top of the heavy issues that the film deals with, makes it an truly unforgettable journey.","

"djtaylor114","7 June 2011","Masaki Kobayashi's Hara-Kiri is a great example of an all-around, expertly-crafted film. What is surprising is that this film is not as well-known as some of the other Japanese films from the golden age of Japanese cinema. Without a doubt, this film should stand high with the rest of them. The film seems to begin with a standard samurai story, but it soon branches off into a much more intricate and intriguing story dealing with love, suicide, dishonor, and revenge. One of the things that strikes me as particularly impressive about this film is the cinematography, which definitely seems ahead of its time. There is a lot of focus on the moving camera, and some of the shots flow so smoothly and capture the action in such artistically-stimulating ways that at times it is hard to believe this film was created in 1962. Some particularly modern shots are the ones during the opening credits where the camera dollies ever-so-slightly down tight hallways. The opening and closing to the film are of the same shot of samurai armor against a black background, and there is something artistically brilliant about this; beginning and ending a movie with the same shot seems to perfectly wrap things up and give a transcendental meaning to the content of the film contained between the two identical shots. In addition to the staging of the camera, the high-contrast blacks and whites make every shot in the film beautiful to look at.The story in Hara-Kiri is very emotional and can resonate even with modern-day Westerners that have little to no understanding of Samurai culture. One of the main themes, which revolves around the timelessness and importance of love and family, particularly had an effect on me, and drew me into the emotions of Hanshiro, the protagonist of the story. Overall, Hara-Kiri is a film that everyone should see. It is because of films like this that I have such an interest in filmmaking; there is no end to the inspiration that can come from such films that touch on the deepest questions of life and reach down into our innermost primal emotions.","

The film is based on Masaki Kobayashi's 1962 classic, ""Harakiri."" and does it up in 3D (I don't know why the 3D). The 17th century drama unfolds through a series of flashbacks as two samurais express a desire to commit hara-kiri, a ritual suicide.","

"Jhenchree","2 June 2011","""Harakiri"", made by Masaki Kobayashi in 1962, is a tale of a former samurai, or ronin named Hanshiro's struggle to make sense of his son-in-laws unnecessary death, get revenge, all while essentially exploiting the corruption within the daimyo Iyi's manor. Kobayashi appeal to the audience is to reveal some truth behind and otherwise glorified samurai lifestyle. He tries to show the although a samurai's word is his bond and they follow a certain code, when that code or bond is broken for your own benefit, things typically collapse. This transforms to an system with a strict code governing its members, but is especially prevalent in the Japanese culture. Set during the Tokugawa Era, Kobayashi wants people to recognize that human life if much more important than any ""Bushido Code"" for samurais. Cinematographically, Kobayashi utilizes many black-and-whites, in a harsh landscape almost stylized like a painting. Emotionally, I really felt for Motome, Hanshiro, and his daughter and their struggle just to get by. Motome's fatal attempt to join the Iyi daimyo and his body's return to Hanshiro's are heart-wrenching moments that seem impossible to believe are actually carried out.","

"Airyoni33","6 June 2011","Hello there, Yoni again. So my second film for review is from Hara-kiri. A1962 film, directed by Masaki Kobayashi. This film begins a bit slowly and has those moments throughout the film and started off with a lot of dialog. This plays off the idea of having morals and honor. Some of the film it was a bit rough for me to identify certain parts of what was going on and the whole concept during the film but this is what I came up with.From what I took from it was Hanshiro Tsugumo enters the house of lords of another character named Kageyu Saito. Tsugumo wanted to commit in a form of Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment (Hara-kiri). This act was only reserved for samurais only. While getting ready for his suicide, Hanshiro goes over his time with Saito and the retainers. Hanshiros lord's house was thought out to be a threat and surrounded by toppled by forces. One of Hanshiro's friends committed the same ritual (Hara-kiri) which caused Hansiro to watch after his son. Towards the end of the film Hanshiro tracks down three of the retainers of the lord's house and blames them for the deaths of his family. But, instead of killing the retainers in a battle he disgraces them by cutting off the topknots of their heads which is far worst then death.At the end of the film, Hanshiro is attacked by all of the retainers and must fight all of them. More retainers arrive after Hanshiro fights all the retainers. This is when Hanshiro decides his time is over and commits hara-kiri to die as a samurai with honor.In this film you could really feel the power of how much honor meant to these samurai's. It was all they cared about and nothing else mattered. These films shows the ""new"" turning point in the 17th century between samurai's that fought with swords and the new military that began to use guns. This film represents retaining a person's honor after disgrace","

"grendel-37","10 January 2005","Just saw this film thanks in part to comments left on this site, avoiding the spoilers of course. Just wanted to give my take on the film, and some of the reviews on the film.First if you haven't seen the film, simply put it's not just worth seeing, it's worth buying. It is a well performed, brilliantly photographed, hauntingly scored, and masterfully directed film.That said it's often spoken of in the same breath as SWORD OF DOOM, and that is highly misleading. If you go in expecting the visceral, brilliantly choreographed sword fights and unrelenting action of that film, you will not find it here.This is very much a drama, a morality tale of a time and a place; an exploration and an indictment of a way of life, and as such it has very few equals. The movie does lag, it is in many ways a monologue, one man talking more to himself than anyone else, of the ending of his life.But an enthralling story, captivating visuals, and above all else, one of the most intriguing and effective soundscapes since the great Dimitri Tiomkin's work on 1950s DOA, keeps this static film... moving and engrossing.Mentioning DOA, leads me to the bashing Hollywood takes regularly here from ""critics"" such as Landor28. Critics who in their rush to praise films, do it by backhanding other films. I'm not a critic, I'm just a reviewer. Critic implies you have some from the mountaintop perspective that gives you the right to criticize. Unless you've made movies, superior to what you're reviewing, you don't get to criticize. Review yes, criticize... no.Has Hollywood made bad films? Yes Hollywood makes its share of bad films, so does Japan, so does India, so does Hong Kong, so does every other country that makes movies. However Hollywood makes the most films, the most visible films, and the largest films, so it is an easy lump-sum target as opposed to taking each film on its own merits. Hollywood in fact is judged harsher by these critics, held to a higher standard than films from elsewhere in the world.I am no defender of Hollywood, as I don't work there, and not fortunate to know anyone who does, but I am a film fan, and a fan of the truth, and to praise films by Kurosawa and Kobayashi and to denigrate the films of Hollywood is to make a mistake these directors did not. These men, like all postwar filmmakers, were inspired by the films of Hollywood, particularly present in the work of all these directors is the large and brilliant work of John Ford.Kurosawa would be the first to state this. Fords widescreen westerns are at the heart of the cinematic recreation of the Samurai. The samurai world as envisioned by Kurosawa as much about history as it is the heroic imagery of the western. They are Stagecoach and Searchers transplanted to the east.A simplification to be sure, but not much of one. Postwar cinema in Japan and throughout the world copied from the states, and that's a good thing. And has started a trend that continues to this day of films successful in one country being copied in another. And we are the better for this two way copying. That's what film is people, copying.Copying a headline, or a book, or a play, or another film, copying a moment and making it your own. That's what all art is, looking at something, copying something, a sunset, a tree, a woman, a birds cry, and adding your own... bleeding to it. That's all life is, being influenced by something people have bled on, and if we are great men, leaving our own blood on it... to influence others.Only those with no art in their souls, don't see this. Only the very young, or the very stupid. Landor28 accuses Scorscese of stealing from Seppuku, an inane comment to make.How many shots in Seppuku but reecho earlier brilliant compositions of Stroheim. But I don't hear you calling Kobayashi a thief. And rightly so, no one owns a shot. Cinema, and images belongs to the story that can tell it. And if that image or look, can service well a thousand films, than it should be used a thousand times. What is film noir, but the same type of look, and camera angles used repeatedly. But used from the directors own viewpoint, it becomes the director's tale. So the comment of theft shows someone ignorant of the fact that there is nothing new under the sun, there are just 7 stories and 5 angles; and all cinema since.... but each person retelling this story through the lens of their own joy or pain.And if they are honest, the story each time... is worth hearing.Give these directors, whether they work in India, or New Zealand or Kenya or Hollywood their due. Shymalan is a great director, Weir is a great director, Fincher is a great director, Carl Frankin is a great director, Lee is a great director, Zimmerman is a great director, Gibson (for Braveheart not Passion), Ron Howard is a great director, Edward Zwick is a great Director (his resume since 89 reads like a bloody history lesson of great films.) and they all work in Hollywood, and their work inspires all kinds of foreign flicks you do rave about.Get off of Hollywood's back, it's always popular to hate the top dog, but it's also sometimes unwarranted.SEPPUKU is a great film, by a master director. ***1/2 out of ****. If you like it also check out these films: GLORY (1989 Ed Zwick), COURAGE UNDER FIRE, A HERO NEVER DIES, KING OF NEW YORK, LE SAMOURAI, SWORD OF DOOM, BACKDRAFT, Excalibur, TUAREG, MENACE II SOCIETY.They are all films about, to one degree or another, displaced honor and cannibal societies.","

"igotasecret","6 June 2011","Now I may be biased about this movie over others due to the fact that I love watching Japanese cinema, but Harakiri was a well crafted and brilliantly well thought out movie made by Masaki Kobayashi. All the actors and actresses acted well on their individual roles. I enjoyed watching and learning the ways of the Samurai Culture. The Samurai Culture was all about obedience, honor and respect. However, one may question whether or not these samurai codes were too strict during these times. The way the film demonstrates Hara-Kiri in a well mannered and carefully crafted method in which does not disturb the viewers to the point where they would call it sickening or disturbing. I could it simply call it a beautiful, yet deadly ritual to acknowledge. The story, itself, is also very well made. There have been quite a few Japanese movies that have tried to implement a story in their rather interesting (quirky) plots, but fail to capitalize by making the film much more confusing. Most Japanese films these days also try to make their movies more vague and make their audience question the characters actions and story plot lines. However, this movie is straight forward and to the point. I really like this film and the way it was constructed. It gave me more insight of the life of the samurai. Even though it doesn't come close to my favorites Japanese movies such as Departures, Battle Royale, Spirited Away or Confessions, it does the subject of Harakiri justice where it fully explains the way of the samurai code well.","

Before watching it I had never watched a single Japanese samurai movie or anything related to it and I really enjoyed Hara-Kiri and how the Japanese culture was captured. Never would I think that a movie this slow would keep me alert and make me want to continue watching, it was almost what I believed made the movie so special, it's different from anything I have ever experienced. Fighting movies and movies about war in general are usually so brutal and extreme but this story takes its time, no rush and it makes it even more powerful!","

"twoteatoroomtwotwo","7 June 2011","Beautify crafted movie. I really enjoyed the visual side of ""Hara-kiri."" I appreciate simple and well balanced cinematography. This movie was another good example that simple composition and slow movement of the camera can have bigger impact than ""nowadays"" extremely busy, and showy cinematography. I like the fact that the film is black and white (1962). A strong contrast, really dark blacks and really bright whites, makes it visually really strong... which I think emphasizes the story, where we have this ""right and wrong"" (""black and white"") samurai honor code. I think that this movie is very universal in a sense of introduced cultural aspects and asked questions, which can be seen more general. What is more important: the life of their own families or following the rules to save their honor? Finally, what is the greater disgrace to the samurai, ""bend the neck"" and humiliate the time of the request, to commit suicide with hunger, or to lose hair-tip of samurai. The answer to these questions, in a context of the Japanese tradition, can not be easily answered... but I think we can ask ourself how strong are we impacted by cultural or social rules... and going further to realize that part of those who should protect the values and follow the rules, are the one who break them. There is one scene in the move I could not watch, hara-kiri with bamboo sword. It was really realistically shot- long take with a close-up. Even it was back and white and the blood did not look ""real"", I was really disturbed, but In the same time I think this scene was necessary to emphasize brutality and nonsense of hara-kiri. After watching final scene in this movie I have no doubt that Quentin Tarrantino, before he shoot ""Kill Bill"", has watched big masters of Japaniese cinema...","

"Maxence_G","31 July 2020","This movie came has an enormous surprise to me, while I anticipated an action-packed chanbara film, its plot is a tragedy, and his thematics are extremely relevant.In Seppuku, the authoritarian government takes the form of the feudal system. Kobayashi was certainly one of the most engaged directors on this topic.His genius is to transpose modern japan in the chanbara style using poetry and well-tough metaphors as well as an extremely engaging a universal narrative. Each character is motivation/emotion/aspiration can be defined by a simple glance at the characters' eyes, at a certain point, I noticed that the subtitles weren't necessary (and I don't speak a word of Japanese). This demonstrates how powerful the directing and the acting of the cast, and especially Tatsuya Nakadai are in this movie. I'm not even talking about the role that lighting an color grading had in this movie because they merit their own analysis!Sincerely, while this movie is indeed not the most action-packed jidaigeki film out there. It is without any doubt gonna be one of the most persistent in memories.","

"paulbegg-10281","2 December 2023","With a career spanning over 70 years, Tatsuya Nakadai starred in many great movies (out of the estimated 100 or so), however Hara-Kiri remains the pinnacle of his achievements; to which even he himself acknowledges, as perhaps his most important work. Yes, there are fantastic movies and then there's great movies.This is the only movie I have given a 10 rating, quite simply because it is pure excellence in which every scene is captivating and multi-layered in its emotional depth. Set in the 1600's in feudal Japan, it is a story of happiness turned desperation, leading ultimately to the cataclysmic act of ultimate revenge.The beauty of Hara-Kiri is how the story is told, as if you the viewer, are a witness to the unfortunate events presented. It is simple yet brilliant with an immaculate execution (pardon the pun) by Masaki Kobayashi, and it's not just a timeless classic, it's probably the greatest timeless classic... ever.","

"kurosawakira","15 January 2013","My favourite Kobayashi, and among my favourite Japanese films of all time, ""Harakiri"" (known in Japan as ""Seppuku""; the former is a spoken term, the latter a written one for the same thing, the former likely adopted in the West on the basis of some general awareness of the word) is a masterly exploration of space, symmetry, honour, disloyalty, tradition, modernity and truth.This film has one of the most amazing opening sequences ever. It goes beyond the best of Greenaway or Tarkovsky in how the camera moves and reveals a space, and I'd like to know whether Zhang Yimou considers this an influence on the similarly masterly ""Raise the Red Lantern"" (Da hong deng long gao gao gua, 1991). Especially the framing in the exterior shots is just as beautifully conveyed. Anyway, back to the sequence – there we are introduced to the idea of the ""house"": not only in the sense of ""assembly"" but also as a building. The main visual motif of the film (the courtyard scenes are another) is very theatrically revealed in shadow and light, and even before the narrative begins (we enter a book read to us, which again, appropriately, is not the whole truth).I am so in love with how the film looks and how the camera moves. Symmetries open, are revealed, tighten. There are amazingly patient tracking shots, especially in the interiors, where the camera sometimes barely moves at all.The performances are just as amazing as the rest of the craft. In fact, this film brings together two absolute icons. For me, Tatsuya Nakadai is the quintessential Japanese actor, even greater than Mifune. His presence is overwhelming, just as his humanity. His eyes speak more than a thousand words in mere glances. Rentarô Mikuni is another, and his work in Ichikawa's ""The Burmese Harp"" (Biruma no tategoto, 1956) and in Imamura's films (most notably in ""The Profound Desires of the Gods"" [1968] and ""Vengeance is Mine"" [1979]) adds tremendously to my viewing experience. There are two very good Blu-ray editions available for this, released by the Criterion Collection (Region A) and the Masters of Cinema series (Region B). The Criterion appears to be cropped on the sides to a surprisingly noticeable degree, however.","

By the time I finished watching this film I was stunned by how good it actually was and had me thinking that I shouldn't judge a book by it's cover. Although it's good the film does gets boring, mainly in the beginning then it has a roller-coaster of emotions, then the final showdown just leaves you stunned. The film itself is a masterpiece in Japanese cinema as this is the film that put Japan on the cinema map and laid the foundation for many other masterpieces from Japan. I would recommend this film to viewers who like samurai type films.","

"jay4stein79-1","1 April 2006","Kobayashi is one of the unsung heroes of Japanese cinema. Ozu and Kurosawa get all the ink, and they do so undeservedly to my mind. Kobayashi, Shinoda, and Mizoguchi do get respect, but their skill and artistry should elevate them above Kurosawa if not Ozu as well. Harakiri is, probably, my favorite samurai film, which, I think, derives from its willingness to talk and explore the concept of the samurai and the code of honor by which they abide. Harakiri seems, to me, to work on a number of levels, while most of Kurosawa's films operate on the most basic one. Rashomon digs deeper, but the rest seem content to exist as fun little action movies with great vistas. Harakiri is different. The setting also helps. The compound in which the action takes place is one of the most amazing sets I've encountered in any film. It seems magical to me, and the cinematography of the interiors is astounding. Like most people, I'm usually more struck by gorgeous photography of open land; interiors are harder to film in interesting ways. Harakiri manages to make the inside of the compound spare and, occasionally, unreal. It's magnificent. Overall, I think this film is immensely enjoyable and will appeal to anyone with an appreciation of Japanese cinema--especially those that would typically avoid a samurai movie.","

"anastasiiapodrez","16 June 2014","This is a very ambiguous movie. One commits seppuku whether his lord asks him to or he commits it because of the loss of faith. This story is about a ronin, basically an unemployed samurai. The protagonist in ""Harakiri"", Hanshiro, portrayed by Tatsuya Makadai, is the only one in the whole movie who actually follows the samurai code, and at the end he is killed by it. Violence takes place in the film as well, so make sure you are mentally prepared to watch people disemboweling themselves with bamboo swords. I enjoyed the emotional cut of the movie and instant shots which really reflect characters' despair and happy flashbacks from their past. Interesting choices were made by the director, Masaki Kobayashi, who has always been interested in the anti-establishment of the world, samurai culture in particular. Everything becomes really tragic when Hanshiro's friend performs seppuku, or when his daughter and grandson die Meanwhile, Hanshiro blindly follows the samurai's code and falls into dogmatism. He assumes seppuku is something true and follows the rules no matter what. Some scenes may seem funny for a contemporary viewer; Kobayashi was trying to add a little humor. Tragedy, politics, drama, and comedy The film has it all. I would recommend watching this film to those who are stricken by Japanese samurai movies.","

"Junglist-london","10 June 2014","""Harakiri"" or ""Sepukku"" is great piece of Japanese art, movie itself has amazing work of cinematographer, you have no doubt that each shot was taken in the right spot. Angles and scenes are just perfect. Of course fight scenes are not as much brutal as we would see in Kill- Bill or other movies where people use swords, but the fact that in this movie they used real swords its frightening.The main point of the main character to come and cut his belly is not just because of situation of his life but also to give honor for those who passed away before and also to point out the problem of dogmatic point of view of high ranked people which actually pointing some interesting thoughts about life in Japan at period of time when movie was made.If amazing cinematography and issues that viable today are not enough to make you watch this movie than just watch it to know what is it ""To be Ronin"" or who are samurais and what was the time of samurais when Japan was extremely distant. I'm not saying that this movie tell the truth about Japan before 1615 but at least it give you a very interesting option of how it could be.Might warn you that movie is pretty long and mostly based on dialogs and flash-backs so if you want sword massacre then watch Kill Bill.","

If the relationship between Bushido itself is set aside, Dazhe reflected in this film is also thought-provoking. Regardless of the political domination and administrative significance, some of the so-called ""morality"" used to restrain people may be manifestations of a contradictory complex . While asking others to obey this way, when ""moral"" conflicts with real life and human nature, can you know how to choose? May not be immersive and never reach a conclusion.","

"Hitchcoc","13 February 2024","A stumbling block for a Westerner is that we are dealing with the Japanese world of the 1600's where Samurai were once the enforcers but were then no longer needed and cast aside. They became beggars and men without hope. There was no work for them. Some then turned to a the realities of the Samurai code. This was Harakiri, which is the ritual disemboweling of the self with a sword in front of a group of clan members. Making things more complicated is that some of those leaders stepped in and provided charity for these men, leading to a wave of them seeking money. But in this one, a young man whose real story we don't know till the end, presents himself for self execution and then wants to go away for a while. He is kept there and eventually, using a bamboo sword, takes his life. But the big story is a man, connected to this young man, who also presents himself, and he tells a tale that is so sad. This is where conventions trump the sad realities of the people. Duty is seen ahead of compassion. Also, there is definitely politics and self interest at work. While this take a great deal of commitment to watch, don't miss it. Outstanding.","

"jia_kehan","18 June 2014","What can be defined a good movie? The movie Harakiri can be the great example. This is a movie with a serious theme means through this old, black and white movie, people can get to know the Japanese samurai history in the specific time period(1619-1630). This movie also can be considered as a historic documentary.According to the plot, it was pretty simple— a déclassé samurai whose daughter and grandchild were sick, the son in law had to go to Kageyu Saito's house to beg for some money by choosing harakiri in front of Saito's house. But Saito did not want to know the reason that forced son in law seppuku by using a bamboo katana. Then the samurai fought back, criticized ruthless rulers and exposed their hypocrisy. As a result, the authorities got angry, and the samurai was too weak to fought the group of the authority's followers, and end up with tragic death. In the end, the matter was covered up by the authority, and no one knows. In Masaki Kobayashi's movie ""Harakiri"", it contained two strictly parallel corresponding stories. From the structure, these two stories were divided into serval parts, and were orderly placed into the plot according to the rhythm and the progress of the story in order to create a rigorous form so that the movie would have a significant theatrical feature.For people, it is natural to love, to be loved, and to survive. There would no reason for people to questioning their love for their family, and sometimes, people would do anything to protect their family just like what Chijima Motome did, and it is hard for someone to despicable or judge him. Also, the true warrior is even though there is hopeless situation can still remain calm, and stick to their principles and dignity.","

"sun_fengya","17 June 2014","This is a very serious film! Harakiri can be a history of documentary , because it reflects the samurai decline; it also can combine with the background and reality in Japan in 1962, think of it is a criticism and political film, also can look it in a moral view, concluded that despicability is the passport for the despicable. But I think the film just want to express---to live, to love. The most important thing to do is to live, can you despicable Chijiwa Motome? He just wants to get money to save his wife and son, Harakiri is the worst way to get money, but he still to do that. People have no reason to love and to life, it is necessary to love and to be loved, do not need any reason. I f you love someone, you still to find the reason you love him or her, your love is already crumbling, do you like this ramshackle life? So I really respect Chijiwa and Tsugumo, they love their family with no reason. The film is very political and depressive, their love is the only warming and touching point.","

"iwalksmall","18 June 2014","Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" or ""Seppuku"" is filled with drama and suspense. Kobayashi decided to tell the story in a non-linear style with plenty of flashbacks. This allowed the viewer to remain on edge, filled with skepticism and anticipation throughout the film. This director has no limits. I don't think I have ever had such a reaction to blood and gore in a film as I did in Harakiri. It got me to my feet. I completely respect his decision to show those elements, as they were completely necessary. This choice commanded that the viewer recognize from the very beginning that this was not just a story of life and death but a tale with deeper meaning. Isolationism was the overall theme of this movie, and Kobayashi does a spectacular job of sticking to this. Whenever we see Hanshiro telling his story from the courtyard we are overwhelmed with this sense of isolation, an every man for himself type of feeling.Cinematically speaking, the choices made in this arena felt ironically inviting and apprehensive simultaneously. Kobayashi makes the choice to shoot the majority of the film at kneeling height or eye level, because that is where the majority of people remained throughout the entire film. It is really one of those films that leaves you questioning, which makes sense as the director was prominently known for questioning all things Japanese.","

"jmholt1984","15 June 2014","""Harakiri"" is a film that was needed to be made by bringing a likely tale of the historic era in the Edo period. The stunning and crisp black and white cinema from the director Masaki Kobayashi showcases the theme of the film and of the samurai with the discipline and orderliness displayed throughout the film. However, there is much more behind the curtain of the so-called samurai. Tsugumo Hanshirō, the hero, or maybe even consider an anti-hero, has a mission to commit harakiri because he has become a shogun and would like an honorable death. The mission at hand isn't really the one the audience or Iyi Clan thought it to be. With a brilliant story and a wonderful battle of Hanshiro and the clan at the end, this movie brings thought provoking elements and a surprising plot twist that will give any more than they expected.","

"Mnemosyne15","17 March 2020","There is a law in human society. No matter what, if it exists for a long time, it will slowly deteriorate, decay, and rigid. As soon as the heyday of the Taiping arrived, there was no need to fight anymore, and Bushido gradually became empty furnishings and forms. Young warriors have hardly ever seen war, and warriors have only become a symbol of identity and status. Like the armor of the ancestor worshipped on the altar, it will not be used for a long time, and it has lost its original meaning and has become a meaningless worship. Bushido, like feudal autocracy, is rigid, degenerate, and decaying. The big name is to maintain the dignity of Bushido, in fact, to maintain the identity and pomp of his nobility.
The film illustrates the decline and deterioration of this Bushido from three different directions.
To the beggar, he was a young warrior, and he also lacked a deep understanding of these tedious warrior temperaments and spirits. However, he is also a simple man, a law-abiding person. However, in the face of the burden of the family, he had to let go of this spiritual pursuit, facing the cruel reality, and sold his sabre with pain. A man who has abandoned all dignity for his wife and children is miserable and bears humiliation. For him, Bushido is just a spiritual obsession, a distant cold spiritual pursuit. He couldn't reach it, so, like a deadly law, he was finally abandoned in the presence of a warm and tangible family. However, the most tragic thing is that this man who was deprived of his dignity and spirit was ultimately killed in his injustice.","

"alexxavier913","16 June 2014","I really enjoyed this Film. You definitely need to know the historical background of Ancient Japan to understand the film. It takes place in a time where thousand of Samurai where out of work and thrown into poverty. It was very interesting to see another cultures perspective on honor and loyalty. I felt bad for the ronins that where poor and had no way to survive. Harakiri is a ritualistic suicide for Samurai in Ancient Japan. This is an honorable ritual. The film tends to jumps around in different points of view throughout the storyline, so make sure you pay attention. What I took away from this movie is that sometimes the traditional ways of respecting authority must be questioned, especially when it comes down to what you believe to be right or wrong.","

"bnl1195","18 June 2014","Mizoguchi does an excellent job at creating a strong willed character that will stop at nothing to expose dogmatic followings of the Bushido code as unnecessary and unethical. I admire Mizoguchi for going against his cultures beliefs in order to showcase his own for others. So often we are quieted by what our religion, parents, culture, etc. expect of us; we are never able to claim our own identity and beliefs in fear of rejection. Hanshiro, who is against the dogmatic version of the Bushido code, is ironically the one samurai who embodies the noble side of it above anyone else. I feel here Mizoguchi was trying to deliver the message that following your own beliefs and ""orders"" is far more valuable than following others orders. Anyone can be a dogmatic follower only a few can think freely and passionately enough to be a counterforce to wrong acts that are seen as societal norms. You can definitely feel that Mizoguchi was influenced by the French New way in terms of how he decides to tell the story—it's not particularly in chronological order. Instead it is a story that is told through a past story (Motome's experience). By telling both of these stories you can further understand what fueled Hanshiro to be the admirable rebel that he is.","

"ortiz-xiomara","18 June 2014","Soldier Masaki Kobayashi directed the Jedi-geki piece ""Harakiri"", which is about a man who is on the quest of committing sepuku (suicide), a respectable death in an honorable place for respectable Samurais. The movie starts out slow with the dialog, because the pace of the scenes and the actors are soothing on a monotone level (I understand that with the Samurais in a sacred place, that is part of their mannerism and culture). However, the more you watch the film, the pace starts to pick up as you listen to the story play on by (there are a series of flashbacks implemented into the scene). As you progress into the film, it turns out that the Samurai is looking for an honorable death, but he is also there to mock the code of the Bushido, and the unbalance that exists within the system that cost him his son in law's life in a horrid way, who he cared for as a son.Kobayashi takes us on a journey about how man, in a corrupted system, tends to either dehumanize us into walking robots, or giving us a choice to find balance in society. I though this was brilliant of him to put this film together, especially since he was a soldier himself, and got persecuted for similar parallel circumstances (not the suicide, but the system of ""doing your job"" in a military stance). Tatsuya Nakadai (who played Samurai Hanshiro Tsugumo) did a brilliant job and stole the show. There is a spiritual element in the film, but I suggest to watch the film and pay attention to the dialog, because this film will really make you think about our current society today.","

"DunuNieminen","16 January 2022","A veteran samurai arrives at a feudal lord's home to commit an honorable suicide ritual. Things take an unexpected turn when he starts telling his reasons to commit this act. I know the director Masaki Kobayashi from his The Human Condition trilogy, which is in my opinion the greatest movie trilogy of all time, with parts 1 and 3 being one of the greatest movies of all time. So naturally, I was really excited to see Harakiri, the movie many people call his magnum opus, and I can say now that is definitely for a very good reason. This movie was absolutely outstanding. First of all, I really loved the pacing of the story, and how it revealed information in a very suspenseful way, that created this amazing buildup towards the end of the movie. On a personal level, this story is very harrowing. There are many scenes in this movie that I would consider to be some of the most heartbreaking and painful scenes I've ever seen. These moments are highlighted with fantastic acting, especially by Tatsuya Nakadai, whose performance in The Human Condition is one of my all-time favorites, and his performance in this movie is also definitely up there. The movie also deals with themes like honor, especially in the historical context of the Japanese samurai code, and criticizes this authoritarian culture within the samurai clans, in a very thought-provoking and interesting way. I really liked the use of music in this movie, which is very minimalistic. The black and white cinematography was outstanding. Especially framing and camera movement were excellent. Harakiri is of the greatest masterpieces in cinema history, and Masaki Kobayashi blew me away once again. I haven't seen most of his filmography yet but I can already say he is one of the greatest movie directors of all time for me.","

"noralee","16 September 2005","I saw Harakiri (Seppuku) in a new 35 mm print at NYC's Film Forum. This is a brilliant use of a narrow period genre to explosively indict politics and culture. Writers Shinobu Hashimoto and Yasuhiko Takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by ""The Count of Monte Cristo,"" Ambrose Bierce and Howard Hawks' Westerns as much as by samurai literature and movies.The film begins deceptively as a story within a story, seemingly providing a traditional example of upholding samurai honor, such as in the conventional, oft-retold tale of ""The 47 Ronin."" The context is set at a time when the central government, the shogunate, is supplanting local clans and arbitrarily unemploying thousands of people, notably their samurai, forcing them into the mercenary mode of ronin at best and begging for food at worse. But the parallels to the 20th century are made repeatedly explicit as the samurai who comes to this clan seeking help is from Hiroshima.Very gradually we get further insight on the tale within a tale, as we see more flashbacks within flashbacks into what each character has been doing before these confrontations and we get uneasy inklings that the moral of the story may not be what it appears at first and the stakes get higher and higher with almost unbearable tension.It is almost halfway through the film until we see a female and we suddenly see an alternative model of masculinity, where a priority is put on family, support, education and creative productivity. In comparison to the macho opening relationships, with their emphasis on formal militaristic loyalty to a hierarchy, a loving husband and father is practically a metrosexual. Seeing the same stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds to his grandbaby puts the earlier, ritualized scenes in sharp relief, particularly the recurring image of the clan's armor which seems less and less imposing and is finally destroyed as an empty symbol.The psychological tension in the confrontations in the last third of the film is more excruciating than the actual violence. Even when we thought we already knew the outcome from the flashbacks, the layers of perception of relationships and personalities are agonizingly peeled away with each thrust of a sword to reveal the depths of the horrifying hypocrisy of the political and social structure. And those are just the overwhelming cultural resonances that a 21st century American can glean. Like ""Downfall (Der Untergang),"" it reveals the inhumane mentality that led to World War II.The repeating motif of long walks then confrontations down empty corridors emphasizes the stultifying bureaucratic maze that entraps the characters. The revenge motifs are accented by startlingly beautiful cinematography that recalls traditional Japanese art, including drops of blood like first snow flakes then a waterfall.The over all effect of this masterpiece is emotionally draining.","

"Galina_movie_fan","21 March 2007","I've said it once about another movie, incidentally by the other great Japanese director as well and I want to repeat my words in regard to ""Harakiri"": ""There are good, very good, and even great movies. But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own"". Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" aka ""Seppuku"" is one of them. The film of rare power and humanism, of highest artistic achievements, profoundly moving, tragic like the best Shakespeare's plays, universal and timeless even if it takes place in the faraway country of 1630, by the words of one of the reviewers ""Harakiri"" ""is to cinema as the Sistine Chapel is to painting. Unsurpassable!"" The film grabbed me from the very first shot, from its opening credits with their perfect harmony of kanji (I believe it is a correct word to describe the writings) characters, with the unusual disturbing score and with the dark beauty of the images. And then the story begins that centers on Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai), one of hundreds or maybe even thousands unemployed lord less samurais, ronin, that in the blessed times of peace had not many choices to adjust to new life and often preferred to commit a ritual suicide, hara-kiri or seppuku on the property of the wealthy estate owners. According to Bushido, the way of the samurai, ""One who is a samurai must before all things keep constantly in mind, by day and by night . . . the fact that he has to die. That is his chief business."" At the same time, samurai and anti-samurai film, ""Harakiri"" offers the masterfully screened scenes of sword-fights, not plentiful but exquisitely choreographed, perfectly paced and unbearably intense but the film is much more than that. It is also a gripping court drama where the truth is unfolded in the flashbacks. The viewers are allowed to look closer at the noble Samurai code of behavior and to reflect on how its abuse impacts the fate of an individual and the society in general. Compelling, poetic, and tragic, the movie has one of the most pessimistic endings ever that makes you wonder how the history is made, how the historical events are interpreted and who decides what would be written in the chronicles and important documents and what would be left out.A Masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made, ""Harakiri"" deserves all its praise. It is not in my nature to force my opinion on anyone but if you call yourself a movie buff or a movie lover, you MUST see this film.","

"frankde-jong","12 June 2020","The generation that came after the renown Japanese directors Kurosawa, Ozu and Mizoguchi is generally regarded as less talented. The main representatives of this generation are Kaneto Shindo, Kon Ichikawa en Masaki Kobayshi. Personally I would like to make an exception for Masaki Kobayashi, who is in my opinion the equal of Kurosawa, Ozu and Muzoguchi.Kobayashi is best known in the West for his ghost stories ""Kwaidan"" (1964). The rest of his repertoire, among which the samurai movie ""Harakiri"" (1962), is not to be sneezed at either.A samurai movie is usually seen as a sort of Western of the East. Main ingredients of the Western genre are action and the battle beween the law (good) and the villains (bad).In ""Harakiri"" (which literal translation is: hara = belly , kiri = cutting) in stead of the law there is the samurai code of honor (Bushido in Japanese). But this code of honor is not the good element of the film. Rather it is revealed as a force of ruthlessness and hypocrisy. In the film the Bushido is represented by the Li clan.In ""Harakiri"" there is also little action. Only towards the end there is something that can be seen as a ""shoot out"". But in this shoot out the evil is not overcome, but only revealed as shallow (the idol of the Li clan is shown to be an empty armor).Translated in Western movie genres ""Harakiri"" is therefore no Western. Maybe it can be categorised as a Court room drama. The heart of the film consists of main character Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) telling his sad story. This story is in essence a requisitor against the Bushido. The performance of Nakadai as a broken Tsugumo is brilliant. His requisitor is not only aimed at the Li clan, but also against his own past. Once Tsugumo also was a samurai.Kobayashi was a convinced humanist all his life. Apart from ""Harakiri"" he also made the 9,5 hours epos ""The human condition"" (1959-1961). This epos is situated in World War II. For Kobayashi kamikaze was just another form of Harakiri and thus just another utterance of the old Bushido.","

"OttoVonB","7 October 2005","Having seen this film the mind becomes clouded with the innumerable things to say about it. Only praise comes to mind. Kobayashi has crafted The great samurai film for the rebel generation and he mixes a deftly handled criticism of authoritarian hypocrisy with a very touching piece of human drama.The plot is deceptively simple: an old samurai (touchingly portrayed by Tatsuya Nakadai of ""Ran"", ""Kagemusha"" and ""Sword of Doom"") arrives at a clan castle to commit seppuku in their yard, and then tells his tale, seemingly trying to gain time at first. What seems to be the rambling of an old man soon turns out to be a grieving account of how this man (and, more significantly, his loved ones) was wronged by the clan. Then comes the violent revenge (this is where you think ""Wild Bunch with katanas"", though they do up the ante toward the end with guns...).Kobayashi's direction is masterful, keeping an unbearable suspense during the mostly talky film, handling the touching scenes with care and maturity and giving us a sweeping fight to top all that. The 133 minutes running time never feels half that long! At the heart of it all though, is Nakadai, who, despite an excellent CV, delivers his greatest performance ever. His Tsugumo evokes a wounded panther, grieving an grieving until it gives in to fury. Nakadai's performance alone marks the film as essential viewing.If you're open to samurai flicks, this will rank among the finest films you've ever seen.","

In a series of flashbacks, we learn who he is, why he came, and what has occurred since. Although quietly told by another ex-warrior (about whom we also learn more), this is an interesting story that builds in complexity and tension. Debates about rituals and appearances may at first seem to hold more significance in old Japan than in the contemporary United States, but it is not difficult to translate and implement such thoughts. Love, honor, duty, family, children, saving ""face"", determination, desperationthey all exist in OUR everyday lives. Dramatically photographed in beautiful black & white, given a strong Japanese score, and paced so that even the mildly patient will be glad they saw it, ""Harakiri"" is epically huge, and a must-see for story & film lovers.","

"Duree","8 November 2001","This film is the purest distillation of the spirit of Greek tragedy ever put on celluloid.  Yes, this is a review of Seppuku, a Japanese film released in 1962.  Perhaps it took a non-Westerner, free of all of the cultural baggage and ridiculous associations, to see straight into the heart of the tragic mode and make it palpable and alive in the twentieth century.  That is not all: the black and white cinematography is both formally assured and often outrageously daring; the soundtrack is one of the finest efforts of the greatest Japanese composer of the 20th century (or any century for that matter); the acting is demonically inspired; and the narrative is relentlessly gripping and involving.  The film illuminates the relationship between the individual and society and between society and history.  It is a tender meditation on familial love and the ties of friendship that transcend even death.  This film will cut open your bowels, pull your soul out, and force you to stare it in the face.  There may be other films that attain similar heights, but I cannot imagine any film, ever, being more perfect. Forget Citizen Kane, Seven Samurai, the Godfather, etc. etc. all of those commodified canonical works that everybody raves about because everybody else is raving about them.  Don't get me wrong, they're fine--but this stuff is 200 proof.  See it today.  Buy it yesterday.","

"lstrawser","13 April 2006","Harakiri is an excellent human drama set in feudal Japan that involves a ronin presenting himself to a powerful clan and asking to commit harikiri. However, through a series of flashbacks we see that this ronin is motivated by more than the idea of dying honorably. The events that follow are a critique of the feudal system and a celebration of dying for one's beliefs.Every frame in Harikiri is wonderfully composed and a treat to view. The cinematography is crisp, the sets wonderful and the actors are spectacular. Much can be said about this film's technical merits as well as its social implications. I found out about this film through my love of Akira Kurosawa's samurai dramas (who else...) and I must say that it is very different from Kurosawa-sans work although it draws inevitable comparisons. Due to its themes, Harikiri is more of an anti samurai film. Generally Kurosawa's work seems to glorify the honor of the samurai and celebrate them as Japanese heroes by showing them gloriously in battle. Kurosawa is the Japanese John Ford, taking an icon from his culture and celebrating it. Harikiri exposes the virtues that Kurosawa portrays as being ""a facade"" to directly quote the film.I say this so as not to mislead any potential viewers, I do not know enough about Japanese history to judge what the samurai really stood for and really I am not concerned with the idea. This is the only Kobyashi film I have seen and it has been brought to my attention that many of his films deal with similar themes. All in all I think that Harikiri is a wonderful film that offers a new take on feudal Japan.","

What the production lacks in scale it makes up for with emotional intensity. The sparse, ominous score is perfect for this film. The direction and cinematography are masterful and the camera's slow pans and zooms really butter my croissant. The editing is great and purposeful too. There's not a single weak performance but Tatsuya Nakadai in the leading role steals the show.My only complaints are with some of the pacing and fight choreography. There's a standoff scene in the middle that could have been cut (since it felt like a cheap way to build tension and it wouldn't make sense for them to continue waiting afterward) and the long flashback could have also been trimmed. The film is 2 hours 13 minutes but I think exactly 2 hours would have been perfect. From a fight choreography standpoint the one-on-one fight scenes were well done but climax was shaky. There were many interesting ideas and moments in there, but also several points where I was like ""okay, how did they not strike him there?""Harakiri is an outstanding film that deserves more attention. If you haven't seen this film check it out. The Criterion restoration is absolutely beautiful. I intentionally kept this review vague since it's best to go into it knowing as little as possible. With a few thousand more ratings, this film would be pretty high up on the IMDb Top 250, and I'd be delighted to see it there.","

"claudio_carvalho","3 February 2012","In 1630, after a long period of peace in Japan after the end of the clans, thousand of samurais do not have masters and are living in absolute poverty. The ronin Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) and former samurai of Lord of Geishu arrives at the house of Lord Lyi requesting a spot to commit hara-kiri (an honorable form of suicide through self-inflicted disembowelment followed by decapitation under the samurai code).Tsugumo is received by Umenosuke Kawabe (Yoshirô Aoki), who tells the story of the young samurai Motome Chijiiwa (Akira Ishihama) that arrived at the house also asking for a place to commit hara-kiri but expecting to receive coins instead. The warrior Hikokuro Omodaka (Tetsurô Tanba) convinces the clan to force Chijiiwa to really commit suicide using his bamboo blade as an example to other samurais that would appear using the same pretext to receive coins from the master.Tsugumo discloses that the lad Chijiiwa was his son-in-law that was forced to the situation expecting to raise some money to treat his sick wife and baby son. Further, Tsugumo had arrives in the house expecting to die not committing suicide, but revenging Chijiiwa, his daughter and his grandson.""Harakiri"" is a heartbreaking and tragic story of poverty and revenge in a period when Japan was ruled by the Tokugawa clan and thousand of samurais lost their work with the fall of the clans. This film is a little masterpiece based on the wealthy history and culture of Japan and the screenplay uses flashbacks and gives an explanation of this period of story for those that do not have a minimum knowledge of the history of Japan. The Internet is a useful tool to understand the big picture of this historical moment.The acting is top-notch and the cinematography in black and white is magnificent.

It was way ahead of its time, and comes from an era when Japanese cinema was one that brought us many timeless gems. The samurai story is eternal story of well placed revenge, hypocrisy, morality, it brings philosophical examinations to the forefront. Acting is exceptional, emotion is raw, film has many subtle yet brilliant moments. Certainly one of the great classics of Japanese cinema, not to be missed by anyone.","

"tintin-23","9 September 2006","It would seem impossible that any ""samurai"" movie could surpass Kurosawa's ""Ran,"" ""Kagemusha,"" or even ""Rashomon"" in visual impact, masterful storytelling, and moral imperative. However, there is such a film, and it is ""Seppuku"" (""Harakiri""), produced in 1962, arguably the best samurai movie ever made.""Harakiri"" (1962), as it is known in the West, was directed by one of the post-WWII great filmmakers of Japan, Masaki Kobayashi. This film, considered by many as his masterpiece, won him the International Jury Prize at Cannes in 1965. Unfortunately, Kabayashi is not as well known outside Japan as some other giants of the Japanese cinema. He was very much affected by the war, and his films, contrary to most Japanese filmmakers of the post-war eras, are very political in nature. Kobayashi's films explore the dark side of the Japanese culture, with its wars, corruption, and hypocrisy, and their consequences. His film, ""The Thick-Walled Room"" (1953), won him the 1956 Peace Culture Prize. His nine-hour trilogy, ""The Human Condition"" (1959/61), won the International Jury Prize at Cannes 1963, which actually launched his public recognition, presents a scathing critique of the horrors of WWII, experienced first-hand while on the Manchurian front, and later on the Ryukyu Islands. While serving, as a statement of dissent against war, he refused any promotion and remained a private until he was taken prisoner by the U.S. He spent one year in a prison camp before returning to the business of film making, in 1946, until 1952 as an assistant director under Keisuke Kinishita.In Japan, Seppuku is the formal term for ritual suicide by disembowelment. Harakiri, as it is known in the West, is the common term, which literally means ""stomach cutting."" It was an integral part of bushido, the code of conduct of the samurai warrior class. Seppuku was ordered by a superior as punishment to redeem some offence, or chosen over a dishonorable death at the hands of an enemy. In both cases, it demonstrated the honor, courage, loyalty, and high moral character of the individual. Except when performed on a battlefield, it was a very formal ceremony, requiring certain etiquette, witnesses and considerable preparation.Harakiri is a particularly painful and rather messy way of ending one's days. In this ritual, the ""performer"" opens his abdomen, starting from left to right and then finishing from top toward bottom. But there is so need to be left for hours contemplating one's entrails. Another swordsman acting as a ""second,"" called kaishakunin, is standing by to decapitate the departing at a pre-arranged moment in the ceremony. Lord Ieyasu Tokugawa, who founded Japan's last great shogunate dynasty in 1603, ordered the practice of harakiri to be discontinued by both secondary and primary retainers. Later on, in 1663, a stronger edict from Lord Nobutsuna Matsudaira of Izu, put an end to the practice altogether. By that time, the ritual had become an idle formalism, and the ""performer"" was decapitated at the instant he took his sword out of the scabbard, thus avoiding a painful death. In some instances, the sword was replaced by a fan.Hanshiro Tsugomo (Tatsuya Nakadai) comes to the castle of the Iyi Clan to seek revenge for the humiliation and cruel death of his son-in-law, Anjiwa Motome (Akira Ishihama). Kobayashi is a superb storyteller, and in a slow and deliberate rhythm, he develops his story, which could have been taken from the pages of the Iliad or of the Mahabharata. The tension grows, as the Clan members slowly realize that they are in turn being humiliated by this stranger who truly believe in the samurai code of honor: he must be terminated to prevent him to broadcast his truth.The final duel with the master swordsmen of the Clan, Hikukuro Omodaka, on the Plains of Gojin-in, is like a meditation, a ballet of death. The film ends in a spectacular combat, and the coup de grace to Hanshiro Tsugomo's seppuku is fittingly not applied by a gallant swordsman, but a cowardly platoon of muskets. Even to the end, the samurai honor code has been violated by the Clan.As Toshiro Mifune has long been associated with the success of Kurosawa's films, so are Kogayashi's films enhanced by the brilliant interpretation of Tatsuya Nakadai (also staring in the leading roles in Kurosawa's ""Kagemusha"",and ""Ran""). This outstanding actor contributed further to the success of this director's films, ""Kwaidan"" and the ""Samurai Rebellion."" The screenplay by Shinobu Hashimoto is based on a novel by Yasuhiko Takiguchi The cinematography, by Yoshio Miyajima, in black and white, is gorgeous. Many on the shots are ""haiku-like"" in the imagery. The musical score, written for an ensemble of ancient instruments and percussion by the renowned classical composer Toru Takemitsu, is used sparingly throughout the film, reinforcing the dramatic moments.Masaki Kobayashi's film is an indictment of the hypocrisy of the establishment, any establishment, would it be in feudal 17th Century Japan or in any other time. Dogma, on which the establishment's authority rests, is evil. The established, codified order, with all its smoke and mirrors, must be preserved at all costs, and nothing must be allowed to come in its way. It is the duty of each member of any government, organization, church, or brotherhood not to spare any effort and to go to any length to protect the appearances and status quo, to achieve this essential goal of survival. The end justifies the means, and no lie or deceit can be eliminated if this survival is at stake.Although taking place almost five centuries ago during the Tokugawa Shogunate, this film is also a strong denunciation of the entrenched cultural legacy of coercive rituals, blind obedience, and chauvinism that resulted in the tragedy of the Pacific War.The outstanding screenplay, the superb acting, the cinematography and editing makes ""Harakiri"" the best samurai film ever.","

"gubami","28 October 2004","When I first saw this movie, I did not know much about it. I saw it for a class so I was given a little background of the time period. In fact I was pretty much just told this: This movie takes place during the time where many Samurai were left ronins, or masterless. These samurai were unable to find work and thereby were left in poverty. Eventually many would go up to clans and ask to commit seppuku.It was dishonorable to refuse such a ""noble"" request, but most clans did not want samurai to kill themselves on their property so they would just pay the samurai to go elsewhere.So I watched the movie and well... I loved it. During the class discussion the next day I found most people hated the movie. Not because it was a bad movie, but because of how it made people feel about themselves. And that's exactly why this movie is genius. If you're interested in watching this movie, do not read the summary in detail - reading the summary in detail will deprive you of what one of the key things that made the movie great IMO.","

"tedg","4 February 2015","This has to be the best movie I have seen in a while. Good luck to me that I would like to pass on to you.We have two warring narrators. The first begins the film as an entry in his journal as local governor of a wealthy country estate. The film is closed with him finishing his entry, some days later. This official narrative deviates from what we see at the end.His story: one, then a second unattached ronin appeal to commit suicide in their courtyard. The first of these it is plain is just looking to be paid to leave, but our narrator is very strict about cleaving to that ronin's story. If he says he wants to kill himself, well then he must. This poor man had sold his sword and was now carrying bamboo, and it is this that he was forced to use. The resulting death is disturbing.So midway in the film, we have a samurai who has suffered because he was forced to live his story, forced by the narrator-governor who we later watch not live the story he has created and instead change it to suit.Now along comes an older samurai with the same request. He is dealt with in the same manner, but insists on telling a story to the assembled household before killing himself. He tells an amazing story: a fall from grace of his master, the dissolution of the household, poverty. His frail daughter and her son lay dying without a few coins for a doctor. The man's son is his daughter's husband, and it is he that came and was forced to die. The wife and son do as well, shortly after. Details of that death were told by the governor to the elder samurai earlier, though known because of the mocking way the body was returned.Until now, we have a classic case of warring narrative. We have the captive audience assembled. One storyteller is an official, so much so that he controls the official version of the film's story. The other has power in his gritty, true story. That story, incidentally is very close to what I consider noir: a random innocent fellow is cast in circumstances that seem full of circumstance and accident. The events of his life are played out not as they would in real life but as they would in a fictional life in a story told by others.Truth versus power in a struggle for the story of the film, essentially a struggle for the allegiance of the outer audience: us.The two beings as they face off are perfect in small mannerisms belying tension.Then slowly, the governor's world explodes as we learn new bits of the elder ronin's story of recent events. Many die.We (the audience) and control of all the cinematic effects was won by the ronin. Our governor is seen at the end writing the official account to be seen by his master that for his safety eradicates all story on both sides. The main actor, the winner, features in some of Kurosawa's best work as well.","

"Gresh854","21 February 2019","Harakiri is about two hours and fourteen minutes of uncontaminated mystery/ suspense-driven domination. This samurai classic capers abroad its tale unlike anything else in cinematic existence, bleeding its reveals through evoking flashbacks, heated, verbal narratives, and hairsplitting symbolic portraits.I didn't expect Harakiri to be such a bold stance on the hypocritical flaws hidden among the ancient Japanese warrior traditions. It's beyond praiseworthy. Additionally, the closing battle's deviant, ingeniously choreographed ramification will have you and any other witness unreservedly floored. (Verdict: A)","

It is really a tremendous example of outstanding film making! The cinematography is absolutely exceptional! However it is the haunting plot of a samurai explaining the meaningless and worthless flawed belief of the samurai spirit which grips the viewer.Tatsuya Nakadais mighty performance in Harakiri further proves for me, that he is without a doubt one of best actors in the history of film. This man takes on his roles with such prowess that it is easy for the viewer to forget that you have seen him play a different role in another movie.By the way - The Criterion 2 disk DVD version is mint!

"gavin6942","7 January 2015","An elder ronin samurai (Tatsuya Nakadai) arrives at a feudal lord's home and requests an honorable place to commit suicide. But when the ronin inquires about a younger samurai (Akira Ishihama) who arrived before him things take an unexpected turn.For many, samurai films may be closer associated with Kurosawa... but this one, possibly the best ever made, comes from Masaki Kobayashi. How does Kobayashi not have the same level of international fame as Kurosawa? Interestingly, Hanshirō is able to fight off a great many retainers with a sword, yet is helpless against three guns; this is a foreshadow of the Meiji Restoration, wherein sword-bearing samurai were defeated by the ""new"" Japanese military. Indeed, the whole notion of ""honor"" and all that comes with it is radically changed once the battles become uneven.","

"FRANK13","12 May 1999","I have seen this movie numerous times (at least 10, probably many more), and enjoy it each time.  The first couple of times I saw it was right after it came out.  It did not have sub-titles, and as my Japanese is not very good, I made some assumptions about the characters, relationships, the plot,etc. When I saw it with sub-titles, I was surprised at how few incorrect assumptions I had made.  That I made so few errors is no credit to me, but rather to how well the plot, character development, character relationships, and the overall movie were done.The movie is not limited to feudal Japan, for it transcends this era.  It has lessons, for those who look for this in art.  For instance, just one example occurs to me now:  It underscores the need for a person to stand on principle, and to maintain their honor, ethics, and dignity, even when those who are the political leaders have long since lost theirs.  However for purely entertainment value, the realism, suspense, art, and action could not be better. Words fail to express how this film captivates and entertains. Few films can equal this one.  It is a ""must see.""","

"auberus","19 May 2008","Masaki Kobayashi studied art and philosophy before starting as assistant director at Shochiku studio. His oeuvre is guided by the need to understand the human condition. In the 1962 Hara-kiri aka Seppuku, we can clearly see the philosophic influence in this story about confrontation between Human condition and Rigid Code of a feudal society. The result of this confrontation is a multi layered masterpiece in which the clarity of the script, the perfection of the interpretation, and a very well balanced ""mise en scène"" make for a powerful film based on transgression: a genre transgression, a code transgression and an image transgression. Most of Shambaras take place during the Edo Period but rather late in that period (just before the Meiji Era) as most filmmakers try to romanticize and glamorize the period which marks the end of the Samurai thus playing the nostalgia card. Here Masaki Kobayashi transgressed the genre and decided to film a story taking place in 1630, 17th century Japan during the Edo period. At that time Japan was ruled by a Shogunate (Ieyasu Tokugawa). The Tokugawa Shoguns established Peace and continued to rule Japan for a remarkable 250 years. But such a long period of Peace had a price and Ieyasu Tokugawa brought the whole country under tight control. He cleverly redistributed the land among the more loyal vassals, breaking up warrior clans thus throwing thousands of samurai into poverty. In the film an elder ronin, Hanshiro Tsugumo, the hypnotic Tatsuya Nakadai (Goyokin) seeks admittance to the house of a feudal lord to commit the act of Seppuku as he can no longer stand his Life of Dishonor and Poverty. There, the administrator tells him about the fate of a young Samurai who committed the same suicidal ritual few times ago. But there is much more to this story and soon we understand that all protagonists are related one way or another. As the film progresses we witness a confrontation between two conceptions. One is based on a Human code; the other is based on a rigid traditional one. Masaki Kobayashi uses both symbols and raw images to show this confrontation. The film starts with the Display of a Samurai shining battle armor representing the feudal system. The armor is empty of anything human and strongly symbolized the feudal system. Can a code make sense if it is followed without acknowledging the Human condition? This is in essence the question raised by ""Hara-kiri"". We see this armor soiled and dragged but at the end of the film the armor remains intact as if nothing had ever happened, as if changes in an given Society take some times to occur. Indeed social Progress has always been slow leaving Men and Women struggling with their condition. The suicidal ritual, Hara-kiri reinforced the sense of cruelty. Raw images of Ronin opening their stomach with a sword were a transgression at that time (1962), still is today. In the film the ritual is portrayed in a non glamorized way and very realistically. It also symbolizes even for the Japanese audience the lack of sense in the act of Seppuku. In fact Hanshiro Tsugumo is the only one giving meaning to this act by motivating it with mixed feelings of Love, Revenge and Sorrow, in short with humanity. With the film Hara-kiri, Masaki Kobayashi signed one of the greatest philosophical films. The script by Shinobu Hashimoto is a good example on how to make a story clear but more importantly sufficient enough for anybody to understand the drama, in one word universal. Also writer of Jôi-uchi: Hairyô tsuma shimatsu aka Samurai Rebellion (1967), Dai-bosatsu tôge (1966) aka Sword of Doom or ""Hitokiri"" aka Tenchu (1969), Shinobu Hashimoto is among the greatest writers of the 7th Art. I can not recommend Seppuku enough, every single frame, acting, piece of music is irreproachable. The story is profoundly Humanist, timeless and universal. I suggest we all confront the codes of our respective societies in order to find out if they still make sense or if they are leading us towards a terrible social Hara-kiri","

"classicsoncall","4 March 2018","Unlike all the Kurosawa films I've seen, this one has a principal protagonist that announces his intention early in the story and then takes the viewer on a stunning journey of revenge that's entirely unexpected. Director Masaki Kobayashi prepares the viewer with a preliminary accounting of the fate of thousands of unemployed Samurai as a result of the 17th Century dissolution of the Japanese Shogunate. Masterless Samurai, or ronin, appear at the doorstep of a feudal lord requesting a place in which to perform ritual suicide, but for the dishonorable, this effort is merely a ploy to accept some small token of monetary value before moving on. ""Harakiri"" tells the story of two such ronin, and until we learn the true relationship of both men to each other, the viewer is at a loss to understand the real motivation of Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai). With frequent forays into the past utilizing a series of flashbacks, Tsugumo relates the story of his son-in-law, helpless in the face of his wife's deteriorating physical condition and unable to seek medical attention for their sick baby due to lack of resources. What I found quite clever about the story was the absence of the three men Tsugumo called for to be his seconds for the purpose of hara-kiri. One realizes that it can't be simple coincidence that none of these men are available, as the story swerves to a desperate climax that pits Tsugumo against the entire House of Iyi. What would have been a tremendous let down in the story is avoided when Tsugumo follows through on his original mission, unable to physically overpower all the retainers employed by the clan's Master. So many films have the story's hero defeat an overwhelming number of rival opponents that it reduces the credibility factor to zero. At the point Tsugumo knows he can no longer pursue a fight strategy, he takes his life in the ritual manner. For followers of Japanese cinema, this film is a must see, with it's emphasis on honor, loyalty and embracing the truth of one's convictions. Tsugumo's unselfish final act unmasks the hypocrisy of the feudal lord's position, and mocks the cowardice of it's counselor Saito (Rentarô Mikuni). An appropriate amount of swordplay attends the story without becoming excessive, allowing for the more subtle aspects of Tsugumo's strategy to take over the narrative, which it does in compelling fashion.","

"WaveTossed","28 June 2005","A classic, surviving the test of time -- made in 1962 about 17th century people. Here in 2005, we still watch and discuss the film and the issues that it raises. Tsugumo Hanshiro, a middle-aged ronin formerly serving a clan abolished by the Shogunate, appears at the Ii clan gate. He wishes to commit seppuku rather than live on in poverty. In his inner headquarters, Saito Kageyu, the chief retainer, bemoans the fact that hordes of starving ronin have been making similar requests at clan gates; most have wanted handouts rather than to actually commit seppuku. Kageyu suspects the same of Hanshiro. Kageyu attempts to discourage Hanshiro. He tells a tale of another ronin from the same abolished clan, Chijiiwa Motome. Motome had appeared a few months earlier, with a request, but had carried bamboo sword blades  the clan members had been enraged. As an example to other scrounging ronin, particularly those without real blades, the clan decided to force Motome to commit seppuku with his own bamboo wakizashi. Hanshiro tells his own life story. The film shows us some historical background. Thousands of ex-retainers had been thrown out of their positions, made into ronin, by the Shogunate's abolishing of clans. In the rigid class system (samurai, farmers, artisans, merchants), these displaced ex-retainers had no place at all, being forced into marginal subsistence. Most trades (because they required long periods of apprenticeship) were out for most ronin. Many ronin became outlaws or obtained bodyguard positions for gangsters. If law-abiding, they were able to teach in schools for commoner children. Or become piecework artisans; they could contract with wholesalers (who also lent money) to make fans, umbrellas, insect cages, ink brushes, and the like. Even as most ronin had to fend for themselves in this netherworld, they still were to carry the two swords of their original rank, and to uphold their obligations. Hanshiro and his daughter Miho make umbrellas and fans to sell to wholesalers for a pittance; Hanshiro is in debt to one of the wholesalers. Motome teaches commoner children and receives a minimal wage for his work. Miho and Motome marry and have a son. All goes well until sickness strikes. Miho contracts consumption and the child contracts a fever. Neither Hanshiro nor Motome can afford a doctor. Motome attempts to get a laborer job (which pays more than teaching does) and runs straight into job discrimination: ""no starving ronin need apply."" Motome sells his sword blades at a pawnshop, obtaining bamboo blades to wear inside his sword fittings, not an uncommon practice; some ronin (and some low-ranked clan samurai) desperately needed money. And yet, the sword was considered to be ""the soul of the bushi."" A bushi who sold his blades had to appear to wear the badge of his rank. The bamboo blades were available, thus no one would know of the despicable act of having sold his ""soul"" for money.But Motome has not received enough; he still cannot afford a doctor. So Motome decides on something more desperate: to appear at a clan gate, with his hidden bamboo blades, in order to request seppuku -- with the actual intention of receiving a handout to get a doctor for his wife and child. The Ii clan officials have decided differently. The scene where Motome must commit seppuku with his bamboo wakizashi is one of the most harrowing scenes ever filmed. Motome is utterly humiliated, surrounded by the Ii clan retainers, with Onodaka Hikokuro, his assigned second preaching on how the sword is the soul of the samurai, the bamboo sword is what is appropriate for Motome, and so forth. While Motome painfully carries forth. Hikokuro refuses Motome's request to cut off his head and end the ritual's mockery, so Motome ends it himself, biting off his tongue. Hanshiro has realized -- too late -- that he had never dared to even consider selling his own sword blades to help out the family. The scene when he is confronted with Motome's body and the truth of what has happened is truly gut-wrenching, as Hanshiro weeps and slams down his ""useless tokens"" that he had clung to. Hanshiro reveals his own secret  he has used his ""useless tokens"" to avenge Motome's death. He has tracked down the three Ii retainers who were most responsible for Motome's death. The final duel between Hanshiro and Onodaka Hikokuro is absolutely stunning. Instead of taking the lives of these three, Hanshiro has taken their topknots. And while Kageyu has preached to Hanshiro about samurai honor, these three swordsmen have hidden themselves away, claiming sickness to cover up their own shame, while their topknots grow back. Kageyu cannot deal with Hanshiro's revelations. He commands his men to slaughter Hanshiro. Hanshiro fights back gamely, taking four of the Ii clan retainers and wounding several more. In a symbolic scene, he tears down the ancestral armor of the Ii clan. Some Ii clansmen use their rifles against Hanshiro, but Hanshiro sticks his own sword into his belly, committing seppuku as he has pledged to do. In the end, Kageyu fashions a cover-up of the entire event; mysterious plagues have hit the Ii clan and a number of their retainers, including Onodaka, have died of ""illness"" rather than by the blade of an impoverished hungry ronin. This film raises many issues. It is Kobayashi's impassioned protest against rigidly militaristic societies that uphold hypocritical codes of ""bushido"" while disdaining what that term really means. The film is also like a Greek tragedy, with a character (Tsugumo Hanshiro) possessing the tragic flaw of his own pride -- which in the end, he must pay for with his life. Which he does in a heroic way. This film doesn't just recount the oppression of poor people. It shows the strength that these poor people have, the choices that they make as individuals, refusing to just bow down and be mere victims of their society.","

Nor am I proud that not only have I spent so many years of my life in front of a flickering screen but that I actually know the number of films that I have seen.With that said, ""Seppuku"" (""Hara-kiri"") makes that whole trip worth while. For every hundred pieces of celluloid tripe you can be fortunate to find a diamond in the rough and for me that was my first experience with this Kobayashi masterpiece. Pure enjoyment, pure excitement.The film is brilliantly constructed and multi-layered in such a way that the film defies genre classification. To call it a ""samurai film"" is akin to categorizing ""Psycho"" as a murder mystery. ""Seppuku"" could easily slide into the mystery, suspense, drama, or western genres and feel right at home. Perhaps an eastern film noir, if you will.Kobayashi's telling of the tale incorporates elements of despair, tradition, fortitude, revenge but mostly love, pride and honor in a grand visual style.The story's setting, direction and Tatsuya Nakadai's strong performance invite the inevitable comparison to Kurosawa and his favorite samurai Toshiro Mifune. All are of such high merit that I would propose ignoring the temptation to compare and appreciate the genius involved in ""Seppuku"".For those who have not seen ""Seppuku"" of course I strongly recommend that you do so but I also suggest that you avoid reading any synopsis and take delight in watching the tale unfold.10/10 (and not too many of the 6,035 are 10's)","

Basically, it's an indictment of feudal hypocrisy, and also a warning about over-idealizing history. Rather than simply a samurai movie, this is an anti-samurai movie. The protagonist is a ronin (a samurai without a leader) in a peacetime era in Japan's history. Coming to an estate, he hopes to take his own life, but this is merely the jumping-off point for a long, complex story.In addition to the acting and directing, the viewer should pay attention to the sets. They're arranged so as to establish a mood. The Criterion DVD includes interviews with the director, screenwriter and star, all of whom talk about the challenges of making the movie. Kobayashi had anti-authoritarian tendencies, and these come out in the movie, with its challenge to militarism and entrenched power. Basically, to dislike this movie is to have no humanity.All in all, it's no surprise that ""Harakiri"" often turns up on the lists of the greatest movies of all time. If you consider yourself a film buff, then you owe it to yourself to see this movie.","

"cwkenreich","9 June 2021","Harakiri is an outsatanding and underrated Japanese masterpiece. It seems to be heavily overshadowed by so-called magnum opuses like seven samurai. However, this samurai film was truly incredible in almost every way. The visuals and the themes complimented each other perfectly. It really shed light on the samurai experience like no film before and subverts expectations with regards to numerous samurai cliches.The recurring mood of this movie is deceitful. Nothing should be interpreted at face value. Our protagonist Tsugumo enters seemingly disturbing the peace at the honorable House of Iyi. He even wears a dark outfit, deceiving one into thinking that he is evil in nature. One would expect that Tsugumo would promptly carry out his ""wish"" of dying honorably. Given that we know nothing about him and that the camera often keeps physical distance from him, he initially does not evoke pity. However he repeatedly prolongs the ritual, much to the annoyance of Sennukko. And Tsugumo finally tells his grand tale which subverts all of our expectations. It's revealed that he is the victim of corrupt government policies initiated by indifferent upper-class elites. He is really out to vent his grievances in front members of the elite.But the film doesn't stop there. Part of its magic was just truly how unpredictable it was. Not only was Tsugumo lying in his intentions, he revealed that three of his proposed ""seconds"" to his harakiri were not sick at all, but could not face the humiliation of losing their buns. The final lines in the film in which sennukko orders the events of the film to be whitewashed to preserve the House's dignity, accentuates the theme of subversion. This is supported when the camera cuts at some of the most climactic moments. While not my original observation, I'd like to echo other reviews in acknowledging how in every death or samurai battle, we never actually see anyone die, or have their hair cut off. It's as if the audience is denied the convenience of being eyewitnesses and instead must accept Sennukko's words with submission.I've read how this film, while taking place in the 17th century, has striking parallels to Japanese institutions during WWII, however I admit to being no aficionado on Japanese history.This was my interpretation of the film. Samurais are often depicted as saviors and honorable warriors (ahem all of kurosawa's films), but this interpretation of them has to be the most pitiful and revealing.In terms of entertainment value, this film was easily 10/10. We grow intrigued as our bereaved protagonist asks to commit ritual suicide after facing poverty. We then have to witness the cringy demise of one previous man named Chijiwa. As we are awaiting Tsugumo to succumb to the same fate, he creates tension by interrupting the procedure with his own anecdotes, where we learn an emotional backstory surrounding the loss of his job and ALL of his immediate family. As if this weren't intriguing enough, the suspense is cranked up when Tsugumo reveals how he retrieved the hair buns and preaches about the evil workings of the ruling class. The ending is a well earned and a well executed climax of realistic and authentic fight choreography for the time the film was made.Again, I don't know how historically accurate this film was and I'm certain many inevitably dismissed it as political propaganda, but the execution of this movie from a filmmaking standard was near meticulous in my opinion.Best Samurai film and probably the best foreign film I've ever seen! 10/10.","

"ersbel","24 March 2008","A masterpiece. There you have a story, you have twists, you have tension. And although the movie is old and there are no special effects other than some blood it's still technically better than the over-done products like Matrix or whatever. Here you... have a clean three dimensional view of the scene both as a figure of speech but also visually the film is 3D. Can't remember one of the recent productions that have a camera that could compare to this one. No CGI and still gives a strong feeling of space and of the restrains of that given space. A masterpiece from all points of view. With a story about how not all things are what they seem to be.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch","

"briancham1994","4 July 2021","This film ranks as a masterpiece among samurai films for its humanistic critique of the rigid, hierarchical bushido code of conduct. The samurai who espouse this code are depicted as either malicious or enslaved by its snare - reduced to begging or arbitrarily enforcing it as a tool of humiliation. The story unfolds in a gradual way, revealing how all the characters have interacted in the past, bringing a lot of context to the situation in the courtyard. This is all punctuated with skillful cinematography of claustrophobic architecture, heartfelt acting and desperate swordfights.","

"paolaxsanchez13","17 June 2014","This film is narrated by more than on e person. However the main character, Hanshiro, gets to tell his full story of how and why he got there to the Iyi Clan. There is suspicion from the beginning when he is asked if he really ants to perform harakiri or if he simply wants money or a job. The counselor asks him this and Hanshiro replies the same answer that his son in law, Motome, did when he came in search for an open hand. Through Hanshiro's story telling, we are able to see the true meaning for why he is there; revenge for his lost family. Althpugh his intention is not on killing them, he simply wants them to acknowledge the unethical way they went about with Motome. In the beginning of them movie, the Iyi Clan armor is depicted as honorable, brave and even a little frightening however after the plot uncovers how the samurai retainers acted, the armor becomes an insignificant and worthless statue.","

And that's probably the only reason how I even found out that this film existed at all.This is why I love movies, when you think you've seen it all, old films like this one just hits you with surprises you weren't even aware of could be in films as early as this one. And for a film about a ritual suicide, I've not been so excited and burst out in laughter in a long time as I did with this one. But I'm not going to say more, because the less you know seeing this film, the better - even the current plot summary on the films page gives away too much, and I'm just happy I didn't read it as I started watching this film. All I can say is that with the fame Kurosawa and Mifune have with their samurai film, I just hope that Masaki Kobayashi and Tatsuya Nakadai will be more known to the world as time goes by, they belong up there with the masters.Currently at the 33th spot on the top 250 list when I'm writing this text, I can only see it go higher with time when more people discover this gem of a film.","

"morrison-dylan-fan","11 June 2020","A few years ago I looked online for some good offers,and picked up a Criterion release for a title I've not heard of before. Arriving in a white case with the title in small font, I put it on the end of a shelf before leaving,where it remained lost for years! Rearranging things during Lockdown, I was surprised to discover that this film had been facing me the whole time.View on the film:Bringing the sword down on this adaptation of Yasuhiko Takiguchi's novel by titling Hanshiro Tsugumo ""The ronin from Hiroshima"", the screenplay by Shinobu Hashimoto brings the defiance against authority in post-WWII Japan to the early beginnings, of what would become a consolidation of power, leading to the 250 year Tokugawa reign.Seating Hanshiro face to face with Saito in the house of Li Clan palace, the poetic dialogue Hashimoto balances the blade with the refine allegorical brutal, feudal authority of the Li Clan being used to rip the other clans and samurai's of the land apart, leading to Hashimoto striking back,and exposing the fragility from shattering their orders.Bringing Hanshiro into the palace pledging to commit harakiri, Hashimoto skilfully blades the allegorical with a absolutely thrilling samurai tale, drawing Hanshiro's compassion for his family with a fierce, passionate fire to fight and save the individualism of his family, up against the authoritative band of Li Clan.Saying later in a interview with Joan Mellen in 1972 that ""In any era, I am critical of authoritarian power."" directing auteur Masaki Kobayashi reunites with cinematographer Yoshio Miyajima, and stylishly displays his rebellion against authoritarian rule with the empty suit of armor hanging above the Li Clan palace like a gargoyle, which Kobayashi brings crashing down to earth via Hanshiro throwing the façade of power from the armor,right back at Li Clan.Cutting Toru Takemitsu's score to sparse inserts, Kobayashi displays a expertise in the use of silence, filling the Li Clan palace with Hanshiro's anguished words, being only interrupted by the lone sound of wooden panels being stepped on as guards rush to Saito's side.Igniting a lit fuse atmosphere which ends in a thrilling final fight, (where real swords were used!) that breaks the walls of the Li Clan palace, Kobayashi begins to shake the foundation with long static camera shots a few feet from the floor listening to Hanshiro, that Kobayashi starkly cracks with tightened close-ups on Hanshiro's agonised face,and refined zoom-ins on the terror sinking into Saito's face.Reuniting with Kobayashi,Tatsuya Nakadai gives a incredibly raw performance as Hanshiro, thanks to the love and warmth Hanshiro gives to his family, being contrasted by Nakadai with a simmering rage to fight for freedom freed from harakiri","

"claszdsburrogato","2 December 2023","Harakiri is the highest-rated film on Letterboxd, but does it deserve such praise? In my opinion, it is a masterpiece. One of the best films in history. Harakiri explores a fascinating narrative. The character development throughout the plot, told in a non-linear way, flows in a phenomenal way. We are introduced to a cizudo character, who seems to have no emotions and someone who has been through a lot of things. Then, during a flashback, we watch the story of a young man who seems innocent and lost in life. It's a cruel film, which doesn't succeed in shocking you visually if necessary for the narrative. It's incredible to follow the protagonist's story and see him go through different moments in his life. Happiness, despair and revenge. Harakiri is a masterpiece of cinema.","

The era often seems romanticised, sometimes even glorified, but you won't get any of that here.

"planktonrules","15 October 2006","This film was very well-made and the story is excellent. The story begins with a man asking his local warlord permission to commit ritual suicide. His reason is that the country has been at peace so long that ronin (out of work and master-less Samurai) have no income and nothing to do. So, instead of the indignity of just wasting away, a vicious and painful suicide is apparently the best option! Instead of instantly granting this request, the Counselor tells the suicidal ronin about a similar request that occurred recently and how the ronin who killed himself probably only asked for permission to die as a ruse to get money from the warlord! In other words, this other man had hoped that his request would NOT be granted and he would instead been given a small income. But, not wanting to see the Bushido code perverted, the warlord demanded that this man commit ritual suicide--even though the sword the ronin had was made of bamboo and doing the painful ritual was super-painful and difficult with such a sword.This story was pretty interesting but how it related to this second ronin is what makes this story so interesting. Plus, I loved how the story ended.Overall, I think this is a bit of an ""anti-Samurai"" film, as it talked how adherence to the rules of Bushido actually could be very cruel and violate the spirit of the feudal system. The inherent cruelty and desire to only worry about appearances instead of right and wrong make this an excellent and intriguing movie. Good stuff.","

"nicholaslalich","5 June 2011","Harakiri is a classic tale of the Samurai, or in this case the Ronin. Masaki Kobayashi does an extraordinary job of incorporating western elements along with typical Japanese humor and vengeance, to deliver one of the key Jidai-Geki films in the history of Japanese cinema. The central idea of the film is to expose the audience to the egotistical, dishonorable side of the samurai, and does so by following Hanshiro (the protagonist) as he calls out the Iyi Clan for disobeying the Bushido Code. Samurai's live off honor, but in a world full of war and violence, this film proves that all morals and honor can be lost, and reveals the sick ways that people go about getting a form of entertainment.","

A spectacular tragic mystery builds up with tremendous pace to the point you feel this nearly 2hr20min is just 90 minutes of pure, unfiltered samurai intrigue. This film is one of the few I would personally break the scale for and give an 11/10. Beyond perfection. Pretty much to the point of transcending our reality as it has long since transcended the film medium to become the Ronin gospel. The lead actor gives a haunting performance that has lingered in my mind for awhile and is the main reason I am writing this review. It simply must be seen by anybody who likes good movies... that's everyone last I checked.","

"Koundinya","23 June 2012","While Japanese movies are synonymous to Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune, this movie has neither of them. It's an unprecedented movie that leaves you brood over the plight of the once-great-warriors of the medieval Japan. The movie is aided by brilliant handling of the camera and loud yet powerful background music. The duel between Tsugumo and Omodaka set in the backdrop of plains with bushes ruffling against the gale was the most impressive scenes in the movie.Samurais, warriors known for their fighting skills and adept wielders of sword, are unemployed and are forced to live in penury after their clans make truce. They even struggle to get a job with workers demanding samurais not be employed. They resort to threatening other clans by saying they'd perform ancient religious practice of Hara-kiri, which is to disembowel oneself, if they are not awarded with a bounty.One such samurai Tsugumo offers his life to the Lyi clan. He's enlightened with the story of a man who gave exactly the same details as Tsugumo. They narrate the story of a certain Motome, who was so poverty-stricken that he had a bamboo instead of a blade and performs the practice in the most atrocious fashion. Motome's sacrifice served as an example to all those samurais who seek fortune in the name of intimidation to end one's life. Tsugumo confesses he was willing to perform hara-kiri whole-heartedly bu wishes his head be slashed by a great warrior of the clan. The warrior is ill and Tsugumo suggests two more names and all the three men have taken ill. The head of the clan senses Tsugumo's plot to procrastinate. Tsugumo wishes to narrate his story before it's time to enter the other world.He concedes that he and Motome were acquainted. Motome was his son-in-law, who taught in the neighborhood to earn a living. Stricken by poverty and an ailing wife and neonate son in the house, he fails to find a job and even sells his priced sword to earn a little money. He then heads to the Lyi clan to implore for the money but he's forced into performing Hara-kiri. Without medication and care, Tsugumo's daughter and grandson pass on. Tsugumo enlightens the men of the clan what actually happened to the men who responsible for his son-in-law's death in a way. An exasperated head orders Tsugumo be severed by the swords and pierced by spears. Tsugumo resists for a while, takes the life of 4 and lacerates 8 others before he dies.The head of the clan orders the 3 absentees be killed by skilled men and cover up all the killings in the name of illness thereby receiving appreciation from the administration.A 10/10 movie.","

"john_billings19","4 January 2004","Seppuku opens up with a shot of the samurai battle armor. Simply a shell with nothing in it at the time. Seppuku reveals the hypocrisy and emptiness in the samurai code and that things are not always as they seem. It challenges traditional belief of honor and what is to be done and simply not to be done. Through the movie the director leads us into belief that Motome is a bad samurai. He is masterless and furthermore unable to provide for his family. It opens up with his preformed seppuku in which everything goes wrong for Motome, we see his as a horrible honor less samurai. Motome comes to the house obviously to beg for food or money. We see that his swords, the soul of the samuari, were sold for bamboo ones. Than he begs for leave seemingly to run away to not have to perform the seppuku. However, things are not as they seem. Hanshiro shows up to the house of the same group. Than, he tells the story as it actually was. Motome was actually trying to provide for his family. He sold his swords for food and comfort for his dieing wife. Then comes to the house to beg for money only so he can afford a doctor for his dying infant son as well. When Motome begs for leave before his seppuku he actually needs time to go back to his family to tell them that he was unsuccessful in getting money and they would have to find other means. What is more just or had more honor, following the samurai code, or trying to save the lives of your dying family members. The writer answers that later in the movie. Hanshiro defeats every samurai that brought his son in law back to him dead by cutting off their top knots. If the house had the honor that they said they did than these three samurai would commit seppuku. None of the samurai do. They fake an illness so their topknot can grow back. The author shows that the samurai honor is really just a front, it is just an image, like the old samurai battle armor. The code represents who they want to be, but the honor is not there. Seppuku is a great story about hypocrisy and fake honor of the samurai code.","

"lasttimeisaw","16 October 2020","""Most actions are confined in the palace's courtyard and other indoor spaces, HARAKIRI flags up Kobayashi's optimal stagecraft, the geometrical blocking of actors, the wide-screen spatial compositions, stationary but never feel constricted; when the actor moves, like in the final one-against-many mêlée, everything is crystallized to a T, the minutely calibrated choreography, the lethal slash and damage caused by the swordplay, and Nakadai's total abandon into a bleeding beast and desperate iconoclast. In a sense, the set piece is even more extraordinary than Kurosawa's best offers in YOJIMNO and SEVEN SAMURAI, because Hanshiro is outnumbered, doomed, a forlorn hope who fights until his last breath, a hero whose valor and integrity will not be extolled but buried, but when the dust settles, we actually feel triumphant for him, what a glorious death!""","

"Suomi_perkele","8 October 2006","Seppuku or harakiri is a samurai ritual where an elderly samurai cuts his belly open with a small sword and makes a cross in his flesh. After cutting other samurai cuts his head of to end the pain. And like this a samurai will die honorably.Seppuku tells a story of one elderly samurai named Hanshiro Tsugumo who has lots of things to tell before his harakiri. He tells a story about his beautiful daughter and her life. You can tell that the other samurais aren't actually very pleased with his story telling because the man just doesn't know when to stop. When Hanshiro finally finishes his stories there won't be his harakiri. No, then a great battle will begin. The influence of Seppuku in modern cinema is obvious. The final battle sequence is lot like in Kill Bill vol.1. And that's not the only thing that is similar to some movies of this date.Tatsuya Nakadai does great job in Hanshiro's role and the rest of the cast aren't bad either. Visual aspects of Seppuku are beautiful and the movie itself is very tough provoking. Well it's hard for me to put all into words because of the language barrier but I'll just say this: Seppuku is amazingly deep and beautiful movie which criticizes the mindless samurai ritual they call harakiri. I'm sorry I can't say much - after all I am young and Finish so English doesn't come so naturally for me.

"filipemanuelneto","22 May 2023","In addition to having a very strong film industry, Japan is a country with a very rich past that we in the West tend to devalue. A somewhat ethnocentric attitude, more typical of small minds. For a long time, the Japanese were a people divided by several feudal princes who fought among themselves, disputing power and regional influence. It was in this context, moreover, that the first contact between the Japanese and the Portuguese took place, the first Westerners to disembark, demonstrably (Marco Polo speaks of the Japanese, but he probably never went there), on the islands of Japan, where they took the first firearm, the Christian faith and a strong cultural influence: even today, in the Japanese language, there are hundreds of words directly imported from Portuguese.The film that brought me here tells us about one of the most fascinating traditional figures of Japan: the samurai, a warrior similar, in essence, to the European knight. They were educated people who were willing to live off the war, as paid mercenaries. In a land where each feudal lord wages war for himself, with his own troops and against his neighbors, it was not difficult to live off war. It would be difficult to live in peace! The samurai had a code of conduct, the Bushido, which dictated rules according to which they guided their lives, seeking to live and die with honor. Honor was more important than life and therefore, in certain situations, it was expected that the samurai knew how to die and was willing to do so, even if by his own hands, in a suicide ritual.The film begins when a samurai, left unemployed by a long peace, turns to an old man and asks to be allowed to die. In response, he hears a story that occurred some time before, and in which a samurai in the same situation made an identical request in the expectation of receiving money, and ended up having to commit suicide, and with a wooden weapon. The film then reveals an important fact: this first samurai is the father-in-law of the man who killed himself, and who wanted money to feed his sick wife and son. And in fact that warrior is not there in order to simply die, but in order to avenge the son-in-law wronged by human hypocrisy.The film is quite dense, and the fact that it is so different from Western cinema and, even more so, in black and white, can quite scare the current public. However, it is worth resisting this impulse to reject it and giving the film a chance. It's very well done, it has a pretty good story, which is nothing behind big Hollywood hits. The script takes advantage of the situation to expose the brutality of the rigor imposed on the samurai by means of a moral code so absurdly demanding that it ended up being inhumane. Contrary to what happens in some films, even western ones, this film does a good historical contextualization of the story it tells us, not being too difficult to understand what is at stake. I'm not the best person to talk about the director or the actors, I don't know them, but I can say that we have the participation of Tatsuya Nakadai, Yoshiro Aoki and Akira Ishihama. On a technical level, I think it's impossible to avoid noticing the quality of the sets and filming locations, as well as the sharpness and quality of the cinematography.","

"eddie_baggins","26 October 2020","Firmly entrenched in movie bible IMDB's Top 250 Films of All-Time list, Masaki Kobayashi's anti-samurai film remains to this day a stunningly crafted achievement that subverts its genre's expectations to give us a samurai film that favors talking and mystery over sword play and sensationalising.Set in the 17th century where newfound peace in the Japanese landscape has forced many samurai warriors that were previously hired for their bloodthirsty skill-sets to be forced out of work and large portions of them seeking to perform a ritual suicide known as seppuku, Harakiri (named for its referencing of this suicidal act) introduces us to a samurai clan working in the house of Lord Lyi as the clan plays host to a humiliating act of the seppuku of a young warrior that eventually leads to the arrival of the mysterious Hanshiro Tsugumo who too seeks to perform his last act in the house.Played out at a quiet but steady pace, Yoshio Miyajima steady camera work capturing every moment and Tôru Takemitsu's unnerving and perfectly suited score working alongside it, Harakiri is one of the era's most proficiently constructed affairs that may at times seem as though its headed for predictable outcomes only to change course unexpectedly throughout as its heartbreaking and confronting narrative takes place around Tatsuya Nakadai's tortured and determined Hanshiro.Working as both an unflinching examination of the samurai code and also as an exploration of post Japanese sentiment in the aftermath of their countries moving forward in the wake of World War 2 and their acceptance of long-forged laws, regulations and traditions, Harakiri evolves from its seemingly simplistic set-up to become an allergy and nuanced deep-dive into the countries history while at all times remaining a haunting character examination.Steering well clear of the over acting and hastily put together aspects that haunted many other similar productions and products of this era in general, Kobayashi's guiding hand help craft Harakiri into an ageless and captivating piece of movie-making, with the underrated Nakadai delivering one of Japanese cinema's great leading turns and the collective supporting cast all bringing their characters to life with carefully considered and well attuned performances.Unafraid to explore its dark themes and moments (a drawn out and horrifying suicide at the hand of a bamboo sword is still hard to sit through in today's more tolerant environment), Harakiri is deserving of its lauded reputation, even if many other higher profile ""samurai"" themed films outshine it in the general public spectrum.Final Say -A film best watched with as little knowledge as possible leading into it, Harakiri is a powerful and confronting piece of Japanese cinema that has remained relevant and required viewing these many years on since its release.4 1/2 bamboo knives out of 5","

"fpyqvcc","9 April 2022","Note: Everything I say in this review is simply my opinion and I do not state it as an objective factHara-Kiri is my personal favorite movie that I've ever seen. The only reason I don't give it a solid 10/10 is because I believe a movie can always be at least somewhat better, even if it's only the smallest detail that is changed. But anyway, I love this movie so much and here's what I love about it:First off I love Cinematography/Direction in this movie. There are so many incredible shots that just add so much to the movie. There's the close up, odd angle shots in the scene where Motome commits harakiri, the shots showing Hanshiro unfazed by the clan around him, the shots where the background is just nothingness, directing the audiences eyes to the important foreground with shots such as the ones of the clans armor, Motome's dead body lying in front of Hanshiro and Miho, and Hanshiro stabbing himself, dying honorably after getting what he wants. And there's the wide angle action shots where action and movement are all over the frame. The direction truly brings the script to life.And Secondly, I love the writing of this movie. I find it to make this story be such a mysterious, emotional, and intriguing story. The main character,Hanshiro, I think is extremely well written, how there are two parallel stories of his going on, the story he's telling, showing the tragedy he went through, showing how he went from a fun happy man to being an emotionless expressionless man with only one goal in mind, while the other story is what he goes through in present time, showing him go from an emotionless man to slowly revealing his vengeful yet understandable motive to the clan. And all of this wouldn't have been as good as it was if Tatsuya Nakadai wasn't able to play this character so well. I also love the dialogue in this movie, it doesn't seem like the script was written by a robot. The back and forth between Hanshiro and Saito is like an action scene with words.I also love the poeticness of the movie. I loved the armor, that at first has no seen meaning, there's nothing we know about it, but later we see that it's the corrupt heart of the clan, that Hanshiro, getting to the heart of the clan while breaking down the walls and then ending up on his hands and knees still pursuing the armor, and then getting to it and throwing it on the ground, getting what he wants, to make a fool of and to spit in the face of this evil clan, and the he kills himself, dying honorably, showing us what an honorable death looks like, what an honorable harakiri looks like, not a huge event meant to abuse someone for the sake of ""honor"" but a death accompanied with the success of a plan with a noble cause. And then the clan tries to hide how he's ruined them, getting rid of the blood stained cloths and propping up their clans armor again, with an ending that looks pretty much the same as the beginning, but this time we understand the meaning behind what we see. But it's still an ambiguous ending, did Hanshiro really win? I view it as yes and I think that the ending is meant to show that while they can physically clean their mansion, we have now seen the stain of what they have done which is ultimately what Hanshiro wanted, to expose the corruption of those who caused the death of everyone that mattered to himAnd then just some other smaller things I love in this movie are the score, which can be exciting, shocking, ambiguous, or saddening, but no matter what, it always adds to the scene. I also love the action, I've already said I think the direction adds a lot the action scenes, but I also just think that the action itself is so well choreographed and actually realistic.Verdict: Hara-Kiri is an amazing written and directed movie, that is poetic, exciting, emotional, and intriguing, In my opinion, It is an absolute masterpiece.","

"bkrauser-81-311064","27 March 2016","American ethos has always had a soft-spot for the conscientious objector. We're a nation of fervent individualists and everything from the writings of Mark Twain to the film 12 Angry Men (1957) codifies that idea. The power of an individual against a torrent of common corruption and blind group-think is almost fetishized, especially in contemporary society. The Japanese, generally speaking, don't have such a provocative streak of individualism embedded in their culture. So it's interesting that one of the most eloquent and austerely beautiful films on the subject should come from the land of the rising sun. Harakiri is a repudiation of the collective values of Japan that, on its best days unites a population in tragedy and at its worst marches a people towards war.Hanshiro Tsugumo (Nakadai) is an aging and embittered samurai whose feudal lord has died in battle along with most of his men. In order to reclaim his honor, according to the bushido code, Tsugumo must disembowel himself in a ritual suicide known as seppuku. To do this he arrives at the feet of Saito Kageyu (Mikuni) and asks members of the Iyi daimyo to help him do the ceremony correctly. Kageyu is hesitant as only a few days ago a similar request was made by another ronin who had no intention of committing seppuku but was looking to extort the clan for money. After Kageyu retells the man's tale, which culminates in the ronin dying by the blade of a bamboo sword, Tsugumo insists his intentions are to die with honor. Yet as the pavilion where the deed is to be done is setup, questions remain. What is Tsugumo's connection to the earlier ronin? Why did he pick the courtyard of the Iyi clan out of all others? Finally does he really intent to reclaim his honor, or is there something else going on?Told in a dizzying array of flashbacks and flash-forwards, Harakiri is not a leisurely movie to watch while folding laundry. It demands the attention of the viewer and weaves a complex tale of Hanshiro Tsugumo's home life after the fall of his clan. He's stricken with the most dire poverty, contemplating his daughter's (Iwashita) sale as a concubine and working menial jobs just to get by. His daughter, son-in-law Motome (Ishihama) and infant grandson Kingo are his only solace from a life of dishonor. Their fates become intimately intertwined with Tsugumo and the Iyi clan in unexpected ways and paying close attention to the plot pays off stunningly in the end.In his own quiet and ultimately unsettling way director Masaki Kobayashi strips away the nobility and romanticism commonly associated with feudal Japan. While doing so he implicates the modern audience (at the time the Japanese public circa 1962) in tolerating authoritarianism under the guise of honor. Harakiri recalls and parallels the days of Japanese imperialism and uses a single individual as a means to take apart the misplaced hubris of anyone still beholden to the old guard. Kobayashi himself was drafted in the army during WWII but repeatedly refused promotion beyond that of a private; his own way of fighting corruption, hypocrisy and evil.The film comes to a conclusion so damning and memorable that I dare not ruin the satisfaction of watching it for the first time. Harakiri is an absolute treasure featuring a star turn by Nakadai who first made an indelible mark on Japanese screens in Kobayashi's The Human Condition Trilogy (1959-1961). Here, while playing a character much older than himself, he still has a certain inner- turmoil that channels James Dean with a strong baritone. Finally there's Kobayashi's masterful direction which watches pensively and almost perversely as the jigsaw pieces fall in place.","

"PimpinAinttEasy","6 February 2016","Dear Masaki Kobayashi, I am not a big fan of Japanese cinema or the Samurai genre. I have watched a few Kurosawas and Ozus and that's it. But things might change with Hara-Kiri which must be one of the greatest revenge films of all time.Your film was was riveting. Objectively speaking, this is one of the best films I've watched in my life. But then I'm a really subjective movie watcher.I really enjoyed the quite beginning. With people walking whisperingly across corridors. I also enjoyed the formal, hierarchical and ritualistic nature of the interactions between various characters and the storytelling. There is something very precise about the way each shot is framed - the men sitting in straight lines ready to attack, the way various objects are placed and also the interiors of the house of Iyi.The first Hara-Kiri scene of Motome Chijiiwa was cruel and sickening. The film is a suspenseful revenge thriller with lots of drama and social commentary.I'm sure the final sword fight scene inspired the one in Old Boy. And this film must have in someway inspired The Hateful Eight - men taking each other on in a really closed space, narrating stories etc.I wasn't that impressed by Tatsuya Nakadai. His beard seemed a bit artificial. I was also a bit bored in the middle when Tsugumo narrates the story of his daughter and her child.But these are minor charges.Best Regards, Pimpin.(9/10)","

"Cosmoeticadotcom","7 June 2012","The film that Harakiri shares the most cinematic DNA with is Kurosawa's The Bad Sleep Well. In a sense, that film is the modern retelling of this film, wherein a vengeance seeking hero plots to destroy his tormentors, only to have him end up dying, as well as having the real truth expunged. But, along with that film, Harakiri never errs by making its politics lead its art around. From the almost exact repetitions of the early actions of Chijiwa and Tsugumo in the Iyi house, to the repetition of the samurai armor to start and end the film, there is no doubt that politics is merely a weapon in the artistic arsenal; it is not its raison d'etre. But, the film also shares much artistry and narrative technique in common with Kurosawa's more placid Ikiru, which also has a large portion of its ending consist of characters relating flashbacks of what happened to the film's lead character. That this dialogue intensity occurs in a samurai film is unusual, but only at first blush, since Harakiri is, in reality, as much of a samurai film as Stanley Kubrick's Paths Of Glory can be called a 'war' film. And, like films like The Wild Bunch and Once Upoin A Time In The West, Harakiri ends with a symbolic foreshadow of the future of the nation it's set in. It is no happenstance that the rogue ronin Tsugumo is not felled by another's sword, but only by guns, for that was the way the Tokugawa Shogunate, the ultimate bad guy in this film, was to fall almost 240 years later.The Human Condition ultimately missed out on greatness because of its length and overarching ambition, which sometimes obfuscated points that should have rung clarion. Harakiri does not suffer that ill. It is a deft lightning strike at its target, and as such delivers a killer blow. It also shows that Japan's filmic legacy, in the 20th Century, was more than its Big Three directors, Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, and Kenji Mizoguchi. Masaki Kobayashi seems to be every bit their equal, and, along with Kon Ichikawa, Hiroshi Teshigahara, Shohei Imammura, Nagisa Oshima, and Mikio Naruse, the middle part of the last century seems to have been, for Japanese film, one of the most Golden of Golden Ages any country has experienced in any art form. Bravo!","

"sharky_55","29 March 2016","The first shot of Harakiri is an imposing suit of samurai armour, seated on a bench amongst cinematic coils of smoke in the air. I say seating, because despite its hollowness, it's posture is imposingly life-like, almost as if at the call of war it would come to life and march off to battle. This must be how the Ii clan see this glorious suit of armour; even in peacetime it is more than just a tool for means of driving back enemies, but a symbol for honour, strength, loyalty and absolute morality. Of course as they prosper, the peacetime has released many ronin, now master-less and without a trade or living, into the wild wandering. This is really a film for a repeat watch. On first impression, Motome's pleas seem a little self-fulfilling, because why would a samurai committed to seppuku want a two day respite if they have renounced everything and are ready to die? His actual act of seppuku too, is extremely hard to watch - Kobayashi doesn't need to show actually graphic penetration because Ishihama's agony is so anguishing to witness. And yet, there is a hint of comeuppance, because it seems phony that a samurai would carry around a fake, bamboo version of his livelihood. On a second watch, these scenes are filled with such a tragic desperation once we know the back-story. The blunt, ironic cruelty of the bamboo strikes becomes heartbreaking because he has already sold his real blades for his family - what is a samurai without his blade? We know without a doubt he would return in two days this time. Doubly so, Hanshiro weeps because he has kept his own blade, foolishly holding onto a past relic much like the witnesses around him do so. Kobayashi has maintained such a steady, tense rhythm throughout the two hours and 13 minutes. Not once is there a line of misplaced dialogue, or a glance that was not filled with the appropriate amount of venom. We see one 'extortion' attempt, and then another from Hanshiro, so of course we await some sort of twist or connection. There is no sense of contrivance when he delays the act, no sense of artificial direction behind these characters. Tatsuya Nakadai is effortless. He has the knack for transforming so seamlessly into his character and becoming every ounce of them - here it is in his blank, almost traumatised expression as he narrates; it could not be more immediately obvious that this is a man who has lost everything. And then there is the little remaining spark underneath that drives this tale of revenge (his cackles as he bemusedly wonders on the fate of three men he has already taken care of), although it seems more vital to expose the Ii clan for the facade that they uphold. The framing device of the narration of the guest book is what seals it. It simultaneously empowers and suppresses the events of the film; even as we witness the despair of Saito, having his pretense so viciously and comprehensively demolished, he quickly rewrites the history books because he has that power (there's a cruel irony to the way he orders the forced seppuku of the three disgraced warriors - the noble ritual being marred). That stirring, dramatic duel in the windswept plains, gone. That desperate, climatic battle, where we might conventionally expect a one-man massacre and a little poetic justice, gone. And even as he attempts to go out on his own terms, Hanshiro is shot by a modernised death-dealer. It recalls Kurosawa's Yojimbo, in which it was actually Nakadai who wielded the gun and brought forth the end of the age of samurai. But here, it becomes a more potent, universally symbolic end. This cruel world does not bend to sentiment. Appearances must be upheld, even sometimes in the face of moral transgression. Hanshiro smashes the suit of armour, but it is gleaming and whole again soon. But it is of course a hollow ideal. All the honour in the world could not materialise a decent man to fill its shoes.","

"francescopiogrimaldi","17 May 2022","Hara-kiri is a story that seems to start having already finished, with a Ronin who chooses to die.And it is in that moment, when you realize the protagonist's concrete desire to pass away, that you wonder how such a story can go on, when in fact a surrender appears at the gates of the Iyi family.And it is in that moment that the direction of Kobayashi, with its wonderful and tragic aesthetics, together with the script by Hashimoto, decides to tell you the story of that story that you had seen up to that moment.Step by step you understand, through an alternation of delicate and studied narrative lines, able to load every single shot with drama and to denounce that Japanese system of the 17th century that still persists to this day.That social paradox, made up of abuses of power and arrogance by the 'Lords', which takes away dignity from humble people, the same ones who will then be condemned to judgment and labels. Tarnish the memory of a person considered 'nobody' by others, when he/she, on the other hand, was loved and loved by the people who surrounded him/her.Hara-kiri is not just a film about Samurai, it is a film that tells about everyday life and how this is then inexorably declined for a system that works badly, that makes you remain alone, that kills even before a Katana with bamboo blade pierces you, with prying eyes and humiliation from those who believe themselves superior to such an extent that they can teach an exemplary lesson.Thanks Kobayashi, you are the origin of the films I loved. Your cinematographic and at times theatrical direction is shocking, capable of making me fall in love with cinema again with a single zoom or with a single connection of gaze.","

"net_orders","16 July 2016","Viewed on DVD. Restoration = ten (10) stars. This is a melodramatic tale set in Japan's early 1600's. It was a time of major societal disruption when unemployed samurai (known as ""ronin"") became a major problem with the ""peaceful"" unification of Japan under one emperor. Ronin lacked few (if any) skills transferable to civilian life. Their rigid adherence to the ""samurai code of honor"" did not help matters. They become dependent on handouts (sometimes coerced and gained by trickery). The director spins a story to illustrate how a military honor code ingrained over hundreds of years can rapidly become dysfunctional and of little practical use when the zeitgeist changes. The point being that outside of military life and its sponsors, the samurai code is really a ""facade."" Direction is seamless and creative: most of the film uses a single set, but the viewer scarcely notices this and is rarely bored (the movie, however, is a bit too long). Acting by Tatsuya Nakadai is a wonder to behold, and arguably the best brought to the ""classical"" Japanese cinema. The score is stark (mostly consisting of what sounds like a single got-tan), but effective. Cinematography (black and white, wide screen) is excellent with scene lighting adding much to driving the film's theme home to the viewer. Set decoration is appropriately sparse with many interiors either shot on location or carefully recreated in a studio setting. Subtitles leave a lot to be desired. They are usually too long with the title writer taking great liberties when translating line readings. Once again Criterion restoration engineers seem to take delight in harassing the viewer when s/he tries to turn on/off subtitles (you never know what to expect until restarting the film).

"grantss","26 May 2019","A samurai, Hanshiro Tsugumo, arrives at the house of the Iyi Clan with an unusual request. Due to his circumstances, he wishes to commit harakiri, ritual suicide, in the courtyard of the house. Turns out this is not such an unusual request: the clan has had such requests before, though the requestor's intentions weren't always honourable. The Clan elder tells Tsugumo the story of the last samurai who made the request and how that ended. Will he still go through with it?Not your average samurai drama. Slow-burning, plot-filled and relatively light on action, this movie will come as a bit of a surprise to most. This doesn't make it less interesting though. In fact, it makes it better.Instead of a basic plot that's just an excuse for heap of well-choreographed action scenes, the plot here is great, and quite poignant. The action is held back until the end, heightening the anticipation. The action scenes themselves are quite realistic - none of the ridiculous Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon stuff - and have a plausible outcome.On the negative side, the slow-burn does get drawn out a touch too long. In addition, in the end there's no clear message - the conclusion is a bit flat.Overall, a great movie.","

"VikingBurialService","7 February 2022","To me, this is the greatest slow-build of suspense in any movie ever. It's like watching an Alfred Hitchcock movie, but it's a samurai period piece. It breaks the expectations of its genre by focusing more on dialogue than sword fighting. In a lot of ways, it feels like watching a horror movie.Story/Plot/Pacing: Basically, a masterless samurai shows up at a daimyo in Edo asking to commit Hara-Kiri in their courtyard. Right off the bat the music and the story clue you in that there's more history and motivations at play, and throughout the movie the tension between the samurai and the other members of the daimyo builds. The only slow-ish part is in the middle, when he's telling his family's story. It drags on a little, but I can excuse it as slowly building anticipation for what's going to happen, especially on the second viewing.Visuals/Cinematography: The set/costume design is great, but what really stands out is the camera work. Almost all the shots are stable, and the camera almost never moved. In the select few moments it does, it only helps build the tension.Characters: Good. Not 'outstanding' but good. I think the main character is the best - he plays a grieving/maddened father/grandfather well, and the way his voice switches volume/power keeps me on edge. The other actors did a fine job. No standouts, but nothing that dragged me out of the moment.Dialogue: Can't speak perfectly to this, since it's subtitled. There's plenty of exposition, but that's more common in Japanese films I think, and it seems to work here.Theme/Tone: Obviously honor, and the contradiction between doing what is morally honorable versus doing what is honorable based on written/societal codes. Very critical of authority.Score: The score isn't memorable (and I can't find it anywhere) but it fits perfectly with the movie. Basically it's traditional Japanese instruments that play sharply/suddenly whenever there's tension. It's used sparingly, and contrasts well with the long moments of silence or dialogue.","

"gbill-74877","30 November 2016","What is more dishonorable, out of work Samurai (Ronin) asking a clan to commit hara-kiri in their courtyard out of a desire to gain employment, with no intention of committing the act, or those in houses being cruel to them? When the country dishonors its Samurai, and they are driven to acts of desperation, leading to cruelty and further dishonor, the country spirals, and this movie set in 17th century seems to reflect decline in then present day (1962) Japan.The movie is quite beautiful visually, with traditional Japanese architecture and at one point a swaying bamboo forest framed beautifully by director Masaki Kobayashi. The story is taut and works on many levels, first and foremost as a vengeance with honor tale, which might remind you of an American Western, including a couple of epic battle scenes. It also has the individual man, disillusioned and saying that the Samurai code he lives by is a façade, and yet acting honorably, against a multitude misled by corrupt leaders. It's one against many in a battle that is timeless and certainly relevant today, and whose results are sadly akin to the entropy of the universe. ""Who can know the depths of another man's heart?"" the Samurai asks, signaling a need for empathy. Indeed.","

I thought the movie was great. I thought `Hara-kiri' was very well written and well developed. I originally thought I was in for another Asian samurai movie filled with sword swinging, kung fu action, but it was so much more than that. It was a movie that shined a light on Japanese traditions and the hypocrisy of those in authoritative places. I really enjoyed the movie. It was one of those movies that if you fell to sleep on it or weren't paying attention you couldn't just fall back in line and think you could still follow the story. There was so much going on that you just wanted to give it all your attention. I enjoyed it because even though it `Die Hard' action packed, it still captured you. To one who knows that `hara-kiri' refers to suicide, you would probably assume that the movie would be grim and coarse. However, it was absolutely the opposite. It was a movie that really helped me to appreciate the strong and noble traditions of ancient Japan.","

"jose-cruz53","29 January 2013","This is a very powerful film, one that I will never forget indeed. Made by one of Japan's finest directors, Harakiri is a near-masterpiece of film. It has a few flaws in my mind, such as a rather poor/unrealistic characterization and stiff acting, that somewhat reduces the overall quality of this work of art. Still, despite those problems, the overall experience remained very powerful and memorable. Indeed, this is one of those movies that I will never forget.One thing that I love about Japanese movies is the fact that they are slow paced and allow the film to really breathe though. Unlike Hollywood movies, which tend to be too fast paced and therefore do not allow the viewer to fully immerse himself into the film.","

"kareem-1","7 August 2006","Now while I've seen way more than my share of great Japanese samurai flicks, this is the only one I've seen so far that delves head-long into the Japanese culture of ""perfection"", honor, code and family. As the main character tells his story you feel more for his pain than nearly Kurosawa movie. For years, I thought Akira Kurosawa was the end all for truly great cinema, but after seeing Kobayashi's opus in Seppuku, it is obvious that 1960's Japanese Cinema had two masters.Seppuku is certainly one of those flicks that makes you say ""Oh SH*T"" halfway through. A deep and enriching story that just keeps getting better as more of the movie is revealed to you. While it doesn't reveal itself to you in a normal unraveling, but rather with a wonderfully told and filmed flashback (while admiringly very long and drawn out - even characters in the film call it so).Everything from the beautiful camera work to the acting delivery is absolutely superb. The close-ups within the flick actually deliver a wealth of information about the scenes that spoken words could only touch on. Truly a masterpiece and worth the wait from Netflix.","

"sandnair87","18 January 2016","Samurai films, like westerns, need not be familiar genre stories. They can expand to contain stories of ethical challenges and human tragedy. 'Harakiri', a shining example of the kind, is about one samurai who takes his time to create an unanswerable dilemma for the elder of a powerful clan. By playing strictly within the rules of Bushido Code which governs the conduct of all samurai, he lures the powerful leader into a situation where sheer naked logic leaves him humiliated before his retainers.The story is set in a time when feudal Japan is at peace, and starving out-of-work samurai beg to perform ritual suicide or 'hara-kiri' at the mansions of powerful clans - a request they hope will lead to a charitable pittance or a menial job. One such lone ronin arrives at the temple of Lord Iyi and asks to use the courtyard to perform honorable ritual self-disembowelment, hara-kiri or seppuku. That seems like the beginning and the end of this movie, all in one: a checkmate. But director Masaki Kobayashi instead constructs a masterful chess game, filled with many carefully constructed moves, each arranged to fit in a particular place - it's glorious to behold!Thus, it would be foolish to give away too much. But the ronin Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) has chosen this particular temple for a very grievous personal reason. His hara-kiri is postponed when, kneeling on the white-sheeted death platform, he requests one after another, three separate house retainers serve as seconds to cut off his head. All three so indisposed as to be unable to attend, the ronin then begs a moment of time to tell his story. Like a brilliant player, he leaves out crucial details until the most opportune moments.The movie openly depicts vanity and corruption among the samurai class, showing that the Lord is more concerned with his reputation than with actual samurai honor. The film has a steady, hypnotic momentum; Kobayashi, wrings as much drama out of facial twitches as he does out of sword fights which are all elegantly composed and photographed to reflect the values it contains. He's helped immensely by Nakadai's molten central performance and the spare, disquieting music. Using superb architectural compositions, Mr. Kobayashi achieves a sort of visual mesmerization that is suitable to the curious nightmare mood.In the end, ""Harakiri"" goes well beyond the usual genre trappings to beautifully underline its recurring theme - that fanatic adherence to codes of honor, by granting them a value greater than life itself, sets up a situation where humanitarian values are forbidden.","

"pere-25366","10 April 2019","Though the act of Seppuku, or ""Harakari"", was abolished in 1868, it was for a long time the true test of a samurai's honor and nobility. In Seppuku (1962), the ritual shows us humanity in its most raw and vulnerable form; perhaps, it is just before death when one's truest colors shine through. The film is a masterclass in portraying the human condition while showcasing some of the best cinematography and direction I've ever seen in a film. Literally every frame (with its perfect lighting, blocking and composition) is like a painting come to life, just perfect. Masaki Kobayashi paces this film perfectly and keeps you engrossed with one of the most beautiful and incisive pieces of human drama I've ever seen. Once the film receives about 1,000 or so more ratings on IMDb, you'll see this gem shoot up to the top 50 easily. It's truly one of the most beautifully crafted films ever made; What a masterpiece...","

"louannsorrylowed","25 March 2021","Peace in 17th century Japan causes the Shogunate warrior clans to dissolve, throwing thousands of samurai out of work and into poverty. An honorable end to this fate under the samurai code is ritual suicide, or hara-kiri (self-inflicted gutting). An older warrior, Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) seeks admission to the home of a feudal lord to commit the act. There, he learns of the fate of his son-in-law, a young samurai who sought work at home, but was savagely forced to commit traditional hara-kiri in a painful way with a blind bamboo blade. In flashbacks, the samurai tells the tragic story of his son-in-law and how he was forced to sell his royal sword to support his sick wife and son. Tsugumo, therefore, starts a tense confrontation of revenge against the house.","

"cstotlar-1","30 September 2012","This uses the wide screen brilliantly with each scene composed as a series of paintings. The camera work is quite subtle and doesn't bring attention to itself although there are a couple of times when it zooms in to a close-up, always dramatically effective. In terms of editing, the flashbacks fit in perfectly with none of the fade-outs of Hollywood at its schmaltziest. The acting is absolutely wonderful. No histrionics here. But the music is phenomenal! It uses Japanese instruments (with percussion) and is minimal but essential. The duel scene on the plain has to be seen to be believed. This is spell-binding cinema of a tale told extremely well where everything we see and hear is absolutely essential and I highly recommend it.Curtis Stotlar","

"AkuSokuZan","20 August 2001","Brilliant!  Harakiri is a movie worth buying.  If you love films, of any genre you have to see this one at least once (it's characters and story are that universal).  Although set during the twilight of the samurai era, Harakiri has  a story which can shake the norms of any modern culture anywhere in the world.  The secure but lonely life of an old warrior and his daughter are like a house built on sand and when the wind of change blows there is a stench from the  injustice and apathy from other samurai who stilll sleep in the illusion of their usefulness.   And no, this film is not about revenge, swords and just killing, in fact the action is so concentrated and sudden it's role is to  jar the audience out of the spell the director and actors and actresses cast and screams ""this is it, it's the end, it's real, and you'll remember every second forever'.","

"Sergeant_Tibbs","22 September 2014","I usually don't like samurai movies. Even Kurosawa doesn't do it for me. I just can't sink into their ways of life and the world of 17th century Japan. However, Masaki Kobayashi's Harakiri totally subverts and questions everything they stand for in a compelling way. It's a study of the human condition in samurai form, naturally from the director of the epic saga The Human Condition, of which I need to finish after being impressed by the first part. It's a dissection of the metaphysical ideas of honour that bind the traditions of these men. While they try to commit to formalities, in the face of conflict they find it impossible. The story unravels like a psychological thriller although it's largely formed of flashbacks and talking but the connections that are drawn and the way the film blossoms to its explosive final 15 minutes is extraordinary. A suicide narrative like this is difficult, what are the stakes and what are the motives? Harakiri keeps you guessing, thanks to the incredible performances and when you feel like you've got it figured out, the whole picture changes. With its stark widescreen cinematography and disconcerting score, its technical aspects bolster the experience. It's a film that works on all levels, Harakiri is certainly the best Japanese film I've seen so far.9/10","

"kaaffilm","27 March 2023","""Harakiri"" (1962), directed by Masaki Kobayashi, is a powerful and gripping tale that explores themes of honor, duty, and the corrupting nature of power. Set in the 17th century, the film tells the story of a ronin, or masterless samurai, who arrives at the estate of a powerful lord seeking to perform harakiri, a ritual suicide, as a means of protesting the lord's oppressive regime.From the opening scene, ""Harakiri"" is an intense and emotionally charged film that masterfully weaves together the past and present to tell a poignant story about the struggles of marginalized people in feudal Japan. Kobayashi's direction is impeccable, drawing out strong performances from the entire cast and bringing to life the complex characterizations of the film's protagonists and antagonists.One of the film's greatest strengths is its ability to challenge traditional notions of samurai honor and morality, presenting a starkly realistic portrayal of the brutal realities of life in feudal Japan. The film's themes of social injustice and political corruption remain relevant today, making ""Harakiri"" a timeless masterpiece that continues to resonate with audiences around the world.Overall, ""Harakiri"" is a deeply moving and thought-provoking film that showcases Kobayashi's masterful storytelling and brings to life a fascinating and complex period in Japanese history. It is a must-see for fans of Japanese cinema, and for anyone interested in exploring the depths of human nature and the power of redemption.","

"SnoopyStyle","28 January 2015","It's 1630. There is peace in the land and many samurai have become poor homeless vagrants. Hanshiro Tsugumo is a samurai whose clan has fallen. He comes to the home of a feudal clan to ask permission to commit seppuku within the courtyard. Kageyu Saito is a senior counsel and he tries to deter the man with the story of another ronin Motome Chijiiwa from the same clan. They forced him to do the job despite he has sold his blade. All he has is a blade made of bamboo. It's a brutal painful event. Nevertheless, Hanshiro insists on continuing with his seppuku and then he reveals that he did indeed know Motome.The first recollection is actually quite compelling. It catches my attention culminating in one of the most memorable horrific scenes. The rest of the movie can't really compare. It's another series of recollections and it's not as compelling. I think it would be just as good to compress the second half and keep the big final fight.","

"SaidNDone","20 September 2020","The first thought I had after finishing Harakiri was that I had just watched a Greek tragedy. Every aesthetic element of Harakiri from the empty scenery to the haunting soundtrack is stripped bare, sharpening the viewer's focus onto the human elements in Tsugumo's description of how his family was led to its fate by the hypocrisy of the Shogunate's hierarchy.The brilliance of the movie isn't in its relatively simplistic plot, but rather in the way it makes use of Tsugumo's framed story to detail the impact social codes have on those left behind by society's unfeeling march forward.As Tsugumo tells his story to an increasingly hostile audience, each scene serves to add further evidence to his point - which is the inherent cruelty in applying an unfeeling Samurai ""honor"" code to a messy reality. This goes on until the final act, in which he brilliantly exposes the tie between honor and the Samurai's most sacred symbols as a facade.In the final act, Tsugumo breaks the Imagawa Clan's self-righteous view of themselves with two actions. The first occurs in the final moments of his frame story, where he inverts the traditional relationship between a Samurai's sword and honor - turning Chijiwa's Bamboo sword, which was previously a symbol of dishonor into a symbol of familial loyalty/love. The second occurs after the Imagawa Clan rejects Tsugumo's message - as their leaders are shown to be dishonorable according to their own honor code and the clan's ancestral armor is desecrated during the final fight, which culminates in the Clan resorting to the use of firearms (over their sacred swords) to take down Tsugumo.But as mentioned earlier, society grinds on, and the now disgraced clan cover up both Tsugumo's tragedy and their own dishonor with the stroke of a pen. The question is - will the Clan heed Tsugumo's advice when the wheels of history inevitably turn them to Ronin?","

"dr_foreman","22 January 2008","While some so-called classics leave me cold, ""Harakiri"" (as it's known in the USA) really fires my imagination. This is a rare movie - the kind that I just can't stop recommending to people.Much of the film's appeal is based on surprising narrative twists, so I'm reluctant to delve too deeply into the plot here. But the basic setup is as follows - Japan has entered a time of peace, and consequently many samurai are unemployed and suffering in extreme poverty. Some samurai develop a ploy of threatening to commit suicide, but only so they can get sympathetic handouts of food and money from rich families. The film explores what happens when that ploy backfires in a very serious way.Director Masaki Kobayashi paces the film very slowly - by comparison, many Kurosawa and even Ozu films are breezy, and of course contemporary American films move approximately 800x faster. However, I am never really bored while watching ""Harakiri""; the film slowly builds toward a (very rewarding) climax, while filling in the characters' compelling backstories. In short, this movie requires - but pays back - patience. Stick with it, and you'll be rewarded with interesting revelations and even some exciting (and surprisingly violent) fight scenes.Due to its unusual blend of action, emotion and social commentary, ""Harakiri"" has shot right up my list of favorite films. I'm tempted to describe it as a Tarantino-style film, only with more of a conscience and a sophisticated worldview. But I suppose that any such comparisons between ""Harakiri"" and American movies must be broad and a little crude. Kobayashi's film stands on its own, of course, and is well worth seeking out for any cinema fan.","

"talldude21192","11 February 2014","This is just a movie about the kind of guy everyone wishes they were. A man of honor with nothing to lose, carrying out justice. Probably almost half of the movie is flashbacks or a story in a story, but when it's pulled off, it's just the most intriguing thing to watch. It's easy to jump to conclusions in this movie, but it's like your whole impression of a character changes every 20 minutes. It's unimaginable as to how much controversy this film caused in Japan, especially coming from a Japanese filmmaker, but it really makes you think about the samurai culture and their position in society. It's truly one of the greatest examples of exploring humanism there is. Every character, even the protagonist, have their flaws that probably cost them a lot, but you're not left not understanding any character. You really can see the story from everyone's very different perspectives. It explores ideas that society never really stops to think about, like when is compassion more important than pride, or how literally should you really take things, and when do you really start abusing power. It doesn't force a message or moral on its audience, but just makes you stop to think about them, and show you what can happen when you take one side of it. You can watch this movie looking for every detailed meaning in it, or just watch it because it's a guy with nothing to lose and a lot of skills, going out for justice. Either way it's great and really a true example of what Japanese culture has brought to filmmaking.","

"svikasha","24 June 2017","The concept of ritual suicide in the form of Harakiri, otherwise known as Seppuku, has captivated western imaginations for centuries. Indeed, the very notion of suicide, for religious or social reasons is viewed with a feeling of disdain within the western mindset. However, ritual suicide held an important ceremonial role for members of the Samurai class in ancient Japan. Viewed as an important component of the Samurai's Bushido warrior code, Harakiri was often used as a punishment but was often done voluntarily as well. It was a matter of honor and upheld the tradition of the warrior code. Harakiri forces the audience to confront the brutality of such a tradition and questions the morality of it. During the film, the main character questions both Bushido and the authenticity of the warrior code. He asserts that Bushido is a mere facade rather than a symbol of discipline. Whether or not these assertions are true, is a question that Harakiri leaves for the audience to decide.During the Edo period of the Tokugawa shogunate in Japan, it was common for master less samurai who were known as Ronin to request to commit harakiri in the palace of feudal lords.In this tradition, a man who goes by the name of Tsugumo Hanshirō requests to commit suicide at a powerful feudal lord's courtyard. Masaki Kobayashi directed this film to start out slow with the old man Hanshirō narrating a story. The story is about how the powerful clan at the courtyard was responsible for the death of Hanshirō's entire family. The old man confronts the powerful feudal clan in such a calm and authoritative manner that the audience is left at the edge of their seats. Hanshirō's daughter was married to a poor Samurai that was so destitute that he had to sell his blade to care for his family. He has a young baby who unfortunately gets sick and becomes desperately in need of medicine. When Hanshirō's son in law came to the Li clan seeking alms for medicine, they chose to punish him for disgracefully giving up his Samurai sword by forcing him to disembowel himself in the Seppuku fashion using the only sword he had left: a dull bamboo katana. After covering the dramatic backstory, the movie masterfully builds up to the final conclusion where Hanshirō uses every last ounce of his Samurai abilities to fight his way into the feudal lord's compound to desecrate his hall. The sheer force of will and determination displayed by Hanshirō's character on-screen is a testament to the acting abilities of Tatsuya Nakadai.Despite being shot in black and white, the film is aesthetically appealing as it depicts idyllic Japanese villages and sword fights in Samurai graveyards. At the climax of the film, the greatest line of the film is spoken. Before the culminating final sword battle, the main character proudly proclaims, ""Motome had indeed gone mad. But I say good for him! I praise him for it. He may have been a samurai, but he was a man of flesh and blood. He could not live on air alone. When he has reached the point of no return, even a man as strong as Motome will go mad trying to protect his family, and I would praise him for it. They'll call him the bamboo ronin. Not only samurai, but townspeople, too, will scoff at his wavering. But let them laugh all they want. Who can fathom the depths of another man's heart?"".","

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","3 July 2020","Essentially a condemning statement on the falsity of the samurai's supposed 'code of honour' and the concept of an 'honourable' death, this slow-burning drama sees a man recount his life as he prepares to take it in a ritualistic 'harakiri' ceremony. The tragedy of 'Harakiri (1962)' is profound and, as it moves from one phase to the next, it manages to emotionally affect in some surprising ways. It's a really layered piece, one with a multitude of intertwining themes and hard-won messages. The few sequences of violence it has are suitably brutal and exciting. They're grounded yet stylish, visceral yet thrilling, devastating yet inevitable. Arguably, the movie's most effective moment is an early example of its eponymous act, as a young man is forced to commit 'seppuku' in an incredibly cruel way. This scene is really difficult to sit through, to be honest, and it becomes even worse when the narrative revisits the reasoning behind its circumstances. The film is slow paced but it isn't boring. It's an interesting, entertaining but heavy affair. 7/10","

"bobcatlew","12 June 2000","""Another one? Is there no end?""So the clan elder of the House of Iyi greets the news that Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) is at his gate with an odd request.  Hanshiro, an old, impoverished, unemployed samurai, seeks use of their mansion to perform harakiri, ceremonial suicide that involves self-disembowlment and is an honorable death for a samurai living in disgrace.But in a time of peace, Japan abounds with ex-warriors who threaten to perform this rite only to extort money from weak-willed clans.  In light of such dishonorable conduct, the House of Iyi has adopted stern measures: Any samurai who threatens to perform this rite at their gate will be forced to do so.  Thus a younger ex-warrior, Motome Chigiiwa, met his fate.  Coming with the same request, this unfortunate youth was forced to carry out the rite with a bamboo sword -- ""an unsightly affair.""  The clan elder would warn the older Hanshiro away with the story of Motome's death, but the old warrior is resolved to die.Things, however, are not what they seem.  Hanshiro seems to have more on his mind than suicide.  And, as he relates his own lifestory to the warriors of Iyi clan, not only are their stern measures called into question, but also the very honor of which they are so proud.Seppuku is an awesome story of revenge told with devastating effect.  By the time you know what the story is really about, you yourself have cast judgement on the characters.  Then things turn on you, and nothing appears as it did before.  In this film a tragic story, great sword duels, haunting atmospheric music, and an exciting final battle combine to form what I think is an overlooked masterpiece.  Director Masaki Kobayashi does to the samurai genre what Sam Pekinpah will later do to the western in The Wild Bunch:  He takes the samurai code and turns it upon its head.  This film is great, and worth every repeated watching.","

"KaceyLeggio","18 June 2014","While ""Harakiri"" was not my first experience with Japanese history, culture or cinema, it was still an impacting and enlightening film. While ruthless in nature, ""Harakiri"" does a wonderful job in conveying the history of ancient Japan, samurais and the Bushido code. While some people's knowledge of samurais only extend as far as the Disney film, ""Mulan"", ""Harakiri"" sheds a great deal of light on the underlying meaning behind the truth, strength and honor of the code. With a protagonist that is both relentless and appealing, ""Harakiri"" delivers special performances all over the board. While it moves a bit slow, there is an undeniable enchantment about this film. The story, while heart-wrenching, is so well done that you come out of it rooting for more. It makes you question history and the way it's perceived, just as I'm sure Mr. Kobayashi intended. With engaging choreography and near-perfect consume and set design, ""Harakiri"" brings you to a place and time that you otherwise may not have known existed. Kobayashi does a wonderful job at conveying the internal struggle between all characters, men whom have an obligation to their families, and those who have one to their code.

The story that was intended to scare away Hanshiro only carried him to tell a story of his own and so he did in the oddest fashion. And through flashbacks we learn it and the more we know the more we understand.. the more we feel.. the more we think.Harakiri (1962), that its events are set out between 1619 and 1630 of the Edo period, is a perfect study of the human mind, heart, and soul. It is also a study of the human relations and that of the society and individual..Through its characters and their contradicting personalities you will learn a lot.. Sincerity and hypocrisy, faith and appearances, love and hate, caring and indifference, courage and fear... The social structure: flaws and corruptness.. The society's symbols and traditions: their depth and when they are only a cover. And then there is history: how it happens and then how it is written.

"TheUnholyPeanut","31 March 2023","Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" is a seminal masterpiece of Japanese cinema, a film that examines the complex relationship between honor, tradition, and power in feudal Japan. Released in 1962, the film remains a timeless and thought-provoking exploration of the human condition.At its core, ""Harakiri"" is a film about the futility of the cycle violence and the destructive power of revenge. The film's protagonist, Hanshiro Tsugumo, arrives at the doorstep of a powerful samurai clan, seeking permission to commit ritual suicide (harakiri) on their grounds. But as he tells the story of a former samurai who was forced to commit suicide under similar circumstances, it becomes clear that his request is more than just a simple act of honor, and this unravels into a heartbreaking, tragic tale.The film's exploration of the samurai code and the role of honor in Japanese society is both complex and nuanced. Through its portrayal of the rituals and customs surrounding harakiri, ""Harakiri"" examines the ways in which tradition can be used to justify violence and oppression.The script and dialogue of ""Harakiri"" are sharp and incisive, with each word carefully chosen to convey the complex emotions and motivations of the characters. The film's characters are richly drawn and fully realized, with each one possessing their own distinct personality and backstory. It is a character study of a man's raging, internal conflict, not an action-packed samurai flick like you might expect, but it is just as thrilling and even more provocative.The cinematography and directing of ""Harakiri"" are nothing short of masterful. The film's use of wide shots and close-ups is particularly effective in conveying the emotional and psychological states of the characters. The contrast between the opulent surroundings of the samurai clan and the desolate, poverty-stricken world outside serves as a powerful metaphor for the social and economic divides of feudal Japan.The acting in ""Harakiri"" is uniformly excellent, with each actor delivering a nuanced and powerful performance. Tatsuya Nakadai, in particular, delivers a standout performance as the film's protagonist, Hanshiro Tsugumo, bringing depth and complexity to a character struggling with the weight of tradition and the desire for revenge, which is a complex and tragic conflict. The rest of the cast also gives excellent performances as well, bringing depth to the characters and script. I particularly enjoyed Tetsuo Tamba's performance as well.The film is incredibly deep, it's themes provocative and powerful. For one, ""Harakiri"" can be seen as a critique of feudalism and the ways in which the ruling class uses tradition to justify their power and privilege. The contrast between the beautiful architecture of the Samurai Clan to the squalor and sheer misery of the peasants highlights this in Feudal Japan. Kobayashi also uses Feudal Japan to critique Post-WW2 Japan in a variety of ways, including how tradition can be used for violence and hatred, something incredibly relevant at this time. We see Tsugumo challenge tradition and the status quo in many ways throughout the film, which culminates in a bloody finale.Ultimately, ""Harakiri"" is a powerful and thought-provoking cinematic experience, a film that challenges the viewer to question their own beliefs about honor, tradition, and power. Its exploration of the samurai code and the rituals surrounding harakiri is both complex and nuanced, and its characters are richly drawn and fully realized. Masaki Kobayashi's masterful direction, combined with outstanding performances from the film's cast, make ""Harakiri"" a timeless masterpiece of Japanese cinema.","

"jamesrupert2014","24 September 2016","Harakiri tells the story of vengeance with a minimum of action (but a surprising amount of blood for a early '60s film). The flashback based story is well told, Tatsuya Nakadai is excellent as the down-and-out samurai slowly unravelling his tale, and the black and white film is beautiful to watch, especially the last showdown. The Samurai film genre lends itself to comparison to the American ""western"" and, with its emphasis on the plight of the destitute ronin, Harakiri could be likened to the early revisionist oaters. Highly recommended, especially before or after a viewing of one of the Japanese versions of ""47 Ronin"" (personally, I like the lengthy, understated 1941 version).","

If you need to find one film that contains everything that makes movies worth watching...THIS IS IT. Honor, loyalty, commitment, betrayal, sacrifice. This magnificent offering from director Masaki Kobayashi is a must see.","

"el98020","21 January 2005","What a movie! I watched it knowing nothing but its title, and I think this was good for me. There is no point writing anything about the plot, actually two reviews (including IMDb's one) I read afterward reveal too much of it. I think the director would like to create a progressive change to the viewer's attitude concerning ""honor"" and ""moral"". Being Black&White and almost theatrical, it leads you to think rather than watch enchanted by the picture. It is not really a samurai action film, neither a film like ""Hero"" or ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (both of which I liked so much, for different reasons), although some scenes have common elements. I know not everybody will like it, it is a bit slow and also cruel but it has a point for both. The picture was a little blur at times, but I don't know if it was the film's or the cinema's fault. Anyway, it's a 42-year-old film, so that's better than we can expect!During the intermission,I was wondering which century I live in, so much was I incorporated in the atmosphere! PS. Do Japanese people really talk with their mouth almost closed?","

"action-6","14 September 2000","I thought that ""Harakiri"" was just going to be an average Japanese Samurai-movie, but this movie was surprisingly good. The movie is pretty boring in the beginning, but it soon evolves into a masterpiece, but it isn`t as good as ""The 7 Samurai"". ""Harakiri"" is a way for a Samurai to commit suicide in an honorable way, so it isn`t difficult to understand that the movie will be about Japanese warriors killing themselves with their sword. It is a movie that captures the atmosphere of Japan in the 1700`s and the sword-fights are magnificent.  Remember that this movie is from 1962, so don`t expect the fight-scenes to be as flashy as in ""The Matrix"". ""Harakiri"" is definetely worth seeing. 9/10","

"bladefd","10 January 2024","Harakiri (1962) is a Japanese film that takes place in 1630, and it is a story of the Samurai code of honor and family. Harakiri (also called seppuku) is the ritualistic suicide once employed by Samurai warriors to die while keeping their honor intact. A Samurai, Hanshiro Tsugumo, travels to the House of a rival clan Iyi, asking for a place to commit seppuku. Clans would permit such requests because it was an honorable final act for a Samurai to save his honor in their house. At that time, Samurai often arrived under a false pretense of committing seppuku but leaving with gold. The clan believes Tsugumo arrived under such false pretense. The story unravels from that point into a flashback of another Samurai, Motome Chijiiwa, who had arrived under such false pretense. I can't say anything more about the relationship between Tsugumo and Chijiiwa without spoiling the story.The filming style is interesting. It is depicted using dialogue and several flashbacks as it draws out the plot. The first hour is slow-paced, but the story picks up pace thereafter. It is ultimately a pushback on the Samurai code and the hypocrisy behind it.Would I recommend this? Yes, I believe it was very well done. The directing often reminded me of Akira Kurosawa's works. I would think the director of this film was inspired by Kurosawa. However, it's probably not for everyone because of the pacing, style, and lack of much action (until the last half hour). Not everyone likes subtitles either.","

"thespeos","29 May 2021","I'm sure there's some rationale as to the great reviews, but I do not share them.I don't have a lot of patience for most samurai film as they tend to:1) Take forever to develop, and ""develop"" is a questionable state
2) The cultural and era often make no sense (in contemporary American terms)
3) They take the traditions and bushido code far too seriously
4) They're absurdly brutish masculine, almost like animalsThis film takes a different approach in that 90% of the film is story-telling, and the sword play is almost ancillary. It's a nice change, but ultimately boring.STORY: If you've watched Japanese (samurai) film then the story is old. It's as simple as vengeance sought for some injustice, which isn't a bad thing. But after awhile, this becomes boring, if not useless. There is ZERO CHARACTER development here, which seems inconsistent with the (seeming) intent of the director. But I felt almost nothing for the characters, or their travail.ACTING: Again, as to Japanese samurai film, it's fine. But there's NO acting that stands up, let alone out. Just dull, flat, mechanical. Aside from the perfunctory grunting, the dialogue is predictable.TEMPO: Very, very, very slow. Not atypical for the sub-genre, but brutally slow.CINEMATOGRAPHY: The scenery is lack-luster, but at least tidy. Props are OK, but sparse. Sound is OK, but nothing interesting.DIRECTING: This same director churns this stuff out on script and cue. For the sub-genre fine, but doubt there's much transferable skill to other film genre.Overall, a slow-moving, run-of-the-mill samurai film. Dull. Pointless.","

"lastliberal-853-253708","29 November 2011","I think it was in Zorro, the Gay Blade, that George Hamilton said, ""The Lord must love the poor because he made so many of them."" In this outstanding film, it is the struggles of the poor that are the prime focus, and the way in which they continue to maintain their honor and pride as they are forced to take menial tasks or watch their loved ones die due to lack of money.It is also timely as the poor we are talking about were the former Samurai who were forced into poverty as their jobs were eliminated by the Shogunate.These newly poor then, as now, are demonized as unworthy, ignoring the fact that it was society that made them poor, and society that made them unable to retain other work except for the most menial tasks. They were often reduced to begging, and that is how the story opens.The story is not what is seems at first as we soon find there is much more than we first imagined.Make no mistake, it includes some great action that one expects to see in a Samurai film, but that is not as important as Shinobu Hashimoto's dialog. It was captivating.The film is an indictment of the class system and it's so-called ""honor."" It also shows the mentality that lead to World War II. It is a film that will captivate you and anger you.The acting is superb, the score amazingly good, and the black and white cinematography first rate.Tatsuya Nakadai (Ran, Yojimbo) was outstanding in the lead role, and Masaki Kobayashi's direction ranks him among the best in Japan.","

having such an immense sense of pride in Samurais. Kobayashi
thought of them as thugs who tyrannized innocent people, and
this was the main theme his whole filmography centered around.Kobayashi is one of my favorite directors of all time, I loved all the movies I watched by him, but his timeless beauty ""Hari-kiri"" was and always will be my favorite movie by him, and probably the greatest Japanese movie ever..","

I think It should be talked about more and more People should know about this film..*It's a Japanese Jidaigeki (Period Drama mostly set in Edo Period) film takes place between 1619 to 1630 in the rule of Tokugawa Shogunate. At the time, it was common For Ronin to request to commit Seppuku (Suicide,Harakiri) in the palace of courtyard in the hopes of recieving money or help from the feudal lords.*The story is Simple. A Warrior without a lord, Hanshiro Tsugumo arrives at the state of Li Clan and says that He wishes to commit Seppuku. The Daimyo's Senior Counselor Saito tells Hanshiro about another Ronin who came earlier to commit Seppuku... and Then the story becomes Interesting.. I don't want to reveal anymore of the story, Just want to say that Every scene of this Movie is Just wow! Every Conversation in The courtyard of The Li clan is just Epic and Mesmerizing... The Action, Background Score, Writing, Cinematography everything is Perfect and Memorable.*It is a timeless classic because It will be always relatable. As the Hypocrisy about Honor and Code, To do anything to preserve the Order.. It makes anyone think that What is Right and What is Wrong after all!*I don't know about the Director Masaki Kobayashi very much, Didn't see his Films prior to this, But I think He did a phenomenal Job in this and many people thinks it's his best.
The actors are very good, Specially Tatsuya Nakadai in the role of Hanshiro and Rentaro Mikuni in the role of Saito did such a fabulous job. Tatsuya Nakadai gives a Aura about his character Hanshiro that You cannot feel anything but Interested!*This is a Must Watch. And if You don't know about Harakiri, It is kind of a Ritual Suicide for Samurai, Google it to know more..

"anirguha-60-851453","26 March 2022","Harakiri. By Kobayasahi is undoubtedly one of the best movies on Samurai genre The way it deviates from the other movies is that instead of showing the valour and values of a Samurai warrior it shows the futility of this valour and code of conduct and emptiness of its values. Although this is a period movie from 1630, the universality of the theme can never be missed. This questions the present days' idea of honour that is expected from the soldiers and civilians alike and unfaltering loyalty towards the codes of conduct that bind them together. This movie challenges this very idea.The cinematography, set design, actings, musical scores are excellent. But these aspects do not make this movie special. The story and the boldness to voice it through such a beautiful and heartbreaking narrative are the sources of greatness of this movie. This will no doubt hold a very high place in the eons of world movie.","

"rauldiul","22 December 2012","This is a genuine, unique and sincere samurai film. The flawless direction Kobayashi presents to us depletes all criticisms. The prudent pace the story moves in is in itself the depiction of the samurai society: the extreme respect, the omnipresent rituals of courtesy, the will to listen to your foes, the patience.The key in the greatness of this film -my favourite samurai film, personally- lies in the meticulous (negative reviewers would have to say here: ""painstaking"") representation of the relationships between these people who live for and by an immutable code of honor,and how the story ends up telling us that, in the end -for better or for worse- man is above any social principle or code. Hanshiro Tsumogo (the main character) is, after all, only demanding an apology for the way the young Motome Chijiiwa was treated, but we see how arrogance stands in the way of the samurai code, and he's left empty-handed.On the other side of the coin, Motome Chijiiwa's act of love for his wife and son, which involves his total humiliation, again defies the samurai code.""After all, this thing we call samurai honor is ultimately nothing but a facade."" says Hanshiro Tsugumo after recounting his story. Not facade in the sense of fictitious, but in the sense of superficial. Because there may be hundreds, thousands of different cultures in the world, but in the end we all love the same way, we hate alike, we envy in the same manner...","

To deter him, a senior counselor tells him the story about a young ronin who is looking for a way to commit seppuku, but set of circumstances has made his death a slow, painful and humiliating. Despite this warning a poor ronin insists that he has never heard that story and says that he has no intention of leaving their palace alive. After a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, the ronin is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. Coincidentally, he has chose three samurai who have participated in the ritual of the unfortunate young ronin from the counselor's story. However, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness. The ronin has laughed ironically and started his shocking confession...This is a very dramatic and tragic story with a very strong final climax. That ritualistic form of suicide is further reinforce the impression of a dark atmosphere. The main villain is a certain kind of a corrupt lord. A desperate and poor hero slowly serves his revenge, with the intent to humiliate and embarrass his opponents. An ancient tradition, political conflicts and shattered pride follow his painful confession. Mr. Kobayashi has enriched a tense situation with a vivid and sad retrospectives. The final battle is truly magnificent, even an occasional shred of theatricality has its role. Characterization is pretty good. Tatsuya Nakadai (Tsugumo Hanshirō) has offered an excellent performance as a desperate and poor, but focused and brave ronin.The brutality and an attack in the agony give us an entirely new expression of the ancient samurai world.","

The film is intelligent enough to explain everything you will need to know though you may know nothing of Samurai culture. This film is amazing to say the least! It forces introspection and doesn't punish you for it, rather you have to come to terms with the fact that you condemned a man with out knowing his story. At least that was how it occurred in my case. Although slow at first, this film picks up momentum and easily enthralls the viewer with a magnificent showcase of storytelling. Of all the films I've seen in my International Cinema class this has to be my favorite, just a top notch film all the way around.","

"ragingbull_2005","10 May 2020","Technically brilliant, narrative wise unpredictable, superbly acted, Harakiri (Japanese) is rightly considered as one of the best films of all time, across all languages.The setup is so tantalizing. A samurai turns up at a grand lord's home, searching for a place to commit suicide. The counselor at the grand lord's place tells him of another samurai who had come a month back with the same request and that sets the ball rolling.If this movie were in Technicolor and I were to not tell you the year in which it was released, it would be difficult for general audience to guess the year/decade of its release as there is not much, if anything, that seems dated.The one drawback for me was one of the sword fighting scenes that lacks the intensity of modern action sequences. However, it more than makes up for it by the time it ends.Very highly recommended. You would be enthralled by its direction and it's narrative trajectory. Truly one of the greatest of all time","

Kobayashi had guts to deliver the sociopolitical stalemates he made within this film and I have deep respect for him having done it. Of course there is more to this film besides its commentary. Its shots and cinematography are gorgeous in every sense of the way and the acting is superb. Most importantly it's narration and story is seamless while its climactic rise is one of the best I've experienced from any film.

It presents us with a rich and thrilling story that has us glued to our seats as we follow different Samurai through an unwinding mystery surrounding the death of a young Ronin.The film gives us a glimpse into the less than ideal lives of the Samurai, and shows us the truly human issues that they had to deal with, like family and loss, instead of simply showing battle scenes. The film is about the priorities that a man has to set for himself, and the conflicting values between the Bushido code, and the family life of a samurai.Through it's form of story structure, the film also teaches us to never judge a book by its cover, by changing who we perceived to be the protagonist originally. This structure, on top of the heavy issues that the film deals with, makes it an truly unforgettable journey.","

"djtaylor114","7 June 2011","Masaki Kobayashi's Hara-Kiri is a great example of an all-around, expertly-crafted film. What is surprising is that this film is not as well-known as some of the other Japanese films from the golden age of Japanese cinema. Without a doubt, this film should stand high with the rest of them. The film seems to begin with a standard samurai story, but it soon branches off into a much more intricate and intriguing story dealing with love, suicide, dishonor, and revenge. One of the things that strikes me as particularly impressive about this film is the cinematography, which definitely seems ahead of its time. There is a lot of focus on the moving camera, and some of the shots flow so smoothly and capture the action in such artistically-stimulating ways that at times it is hard to believe this film was created in 1962. Some particularly modern shots are the ones during the opening credits where the camera dollies ever-so-slightly down tight hallways. The opening and closing to the film are of the same shot of samurai armor against a black background, and there is something artistically brilliant about this; beginning and ending a movie with the same shot seems to perfectly wrap things up and give a transcendental meaning to the content of the film contained between the two identical shots. In addition to the staging of the camera, the high-contrast blacks and whites make every shot in the film beautiful to look at.The story in Hara-Kiri is very emotional and can resonate even with modern-day Westerners that have little to no understanding of Samurai culture. One of the main themes, which revolves around the timelessness and importance of love and family, particularly had an effect on me, and drew me into the emotions of Hanshiro, the protagonist of the story. Overall, Hara-Kiri is a film that everyone should see. It is because of films like this that I have such an interest in filmmaking; there is no end to the inspiration that can come from such films that touch on the deepest questions of life and reach down into our innermost primal emotions.","

Kobayashi appeal to the audience is to reveal some truth behind and otherwise glorified samurai lifestyle. He tries to show the although a samurai's word is his bond and they follow a certain code, when that code or bond is broken for your own benefit, things typically collapse. This transforms to an system with a strict code governing its members, but is especially prevalent in the Japanese culture. Set during the Tokugawa Era, Kobayashi wants people to recognize that human life if much more important than any ""Bushido Code"" for samurais. Cinematographically, Kobayashi utilizes many black-and-whites, in a harsh landscape almost stylized like a painting. Emotionally, I really felt for Motome, Hanshiro, and his daughter and their struggle just to get by. Motome's fatal attempt to join the Iyi daimyo and his body's return to Hanshiro's are heart-wrenching moments that seem impossible to believe are actually carried out.","

"Airyoni33","6 June 2011","Hello there, Yoni again. So my second film for review is from Hara-kiri. A1962 film, directed by Masaki Kobayashi. This film begins a bit slowly and has those moments throughout the film and started off with a lot of dialog. This plays off the idea of having morals and honor. Some of the film it was a bit rough for me to identify certain parts of what was going on and the whole concept during the film but this is what I came up with.From what I took from it was Hanshiro Tsugumo enters the house of lords of another character named Kageyu Saito. Tsugumo wanted to commit in a form of Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment (Hara-kiri). This act was only reserved for samurais only. While getting ready for his suicide, Hanshiro goes over his time with Saito and the retainers. Hanshiros lord's house was thought out to be a threat and surrounded by toppled by forces. One of Hanshiro's friends committed the same ritual (Hara-kiri) which caused Hansiro to watch after his son. Towards the end of the film Hanshiro tracks down three of the retainers of the lord's house and blames them for the deaths of his family. But, instead of killing the retainers in a battle he disgraces them by cutting off the topknots of their heads which is far worst then death.At the end of the film, Hanshiro is attacked by all of the retainers and must fight all of them. More retainers arrive after Hanshiro fights all the retainers. This is when Hanshiro decides his time is over and commits hara-kiri to die as a samurai with honor.In this film you could really feel the power of how much honor meant to these samurai's. It was all they cared about and nothing else mattered. These films shows the ""new"" turning point in the 17th century between samurai's that fought with swords and the new military that began to use guns. This film represents retaining a person's honor after disgrace","

"grendel-37","10 January 2005","Just saw this film thanks in part to comments left on this site, avoiding the spoilers of course. Just wanted to give my take on the film, and some of the reviews on the film.First if you haven't seen the film, simply put it's not just worth seeing, it's worth buying. It is a well performed, brilliantly photographed, hauntingly scored, and masterfully directed film.That said it's often spoken of in the same breath as SWORD OF DOOM, and that is highly misleading. If you go in expecting the visceral, brilliantly choreographed sword fights and unrelenting action of that film, you will not find it here.This is very much a drama, a morality tale of a time and a place; an exploration and an indictment of a way of life, and as such it has very few equals. The movie does lag, it is in many ways a monologue, one man talking more to himself than anyone else, of the ending of his life.But an enthralling story, captivating visuals, and above all else, one of the most intriguing and effective soundscapes since the great Dimitri Tiomkin's work on 1950s DOA, keeps this static film... moving and engrossing.Mentioning DOA, leads me to the bashing Hollywood takes regularly here from ""critics"" such as Landor28. Critics who in their rush to praise films, do it by backhanding other films. I'm not a critic, I'm just a reviewer. Critic implies you have some from the mountaintop perspective that gives you the right to criticize. Unless you've made movies, superior to what you're reviewing, you don't get to criticize. Review yes, criticize... no.Has Hollywood made bad films? Yes Hollywood makes its share of bad films, so does Japan, so does India, so does Hong Kong, so does every other country that makes movies. However Hollywood makes the most films, the most visible films, and the largest films, so it is an easy lump-sum target as opposed to taking each film on its own merits. Hollywood in fact is judged harsher by these critics, held to a higher standard than films from elsewhere in the world.I am no defender of Hollywood, as I don't work there, and not fortunate to know anyone who does, but I am a film fan, and a fan of the truth, and to praise films by Kurosawa and Kobayashi and to denigrate the films of Hollywood is to make a mistake these directors did not. These men, like all postwar filmmakers, were inspired by the films of Hollywood, particularly present in the work of all these directors is the large and brilliant work of John Ford.Kurosawa would be the first to state this. Fords widescreen westerns are at the heart of the cinematic recreation of the Samurai. The samurai world as envisioned by Kurosawa as much about history as it is the heroic imagery of the western. They are Stagecoach and Searchers transplanted to the east.A simplification to be sure, but not much of one. Postwar cinema in Japan and throughout the world copied from the states, and that's a good thing. And has started a trend that continues to this day of films successful in one country being copied in another. And we are the better for this two way copying. That's what film is people, copying.Copying a headline, or a book, or a play, or another film, copying a moment and making it your own. That's what all art is, looking at something, copying something, a sunset, a tree, a woman, a birds cry, and adding your own... bleeding to it. That's all life is, being influenced by something people have bled on, and if we are great men, leaving our own blood on it... to influence others.Only those with no art in their souls, don't see this. Only the very young, or the very stupid. Landor28 accuses Scorscese of stealing from Seppuku, an inane comment to make.How many shots in Seppuku but reecho earlier brilliant compositions of Stroheim. But I don't hear you calling Kobayashi a thief. And rightly so, no one owns a shot. Cinema, and images belongs to the story that can tell it. And if that image or look, can service well a thousand films, than it should be used a thousand times. What is film noir, but the same type of look, and camera angles used repeatedly. But used from the directors own viewpoint, it becomes the director's tale. So the comment of theft shows someone ignorant of the fact that there is nothing new under the sun, there are just 7 stories and 5 angles; and all cinema since.... but each person retelling this story through the lens of their own joy or pain.And if they are honest, the story each time... is worth hearing.Give these directors, whether they work in India, or New Zealand or Kenya or Hollywood their due. Shymalan is a great director, Weir is a great director, Fincher is a great director, Carl Frankin is a great director, Lee is a great director, Zimmerman is a great director, Gibson (for Braveheart not Passion), Ron Howard is a great director, Edward Zwick is a great Director (his resume since 89 reads like a bloody history lesson of great films.) and they all work in Hollywood, and their work inspires all kinds of foreign flicks you do rave about.Get off of Hollywood's back, it's always popular to hate the top dog, but it's also sometimes unwarranted.SEPPUKU is a great film, by a master director. ***1/2 out of ****. If you like it also check out these films: GLORY (1989 Ed Zwick), COURAGE UNDER FIRE, A HERO NEVER DIES, KING OF NEW YORK, LE SAMOURAI, SWORD OF DOOM, BACKDRAFT, Excalibur, TUAREG, MENACE II SOCIETY.They are all films about, to one degree or another, displaced honor and cannibal societies.","

"igotasecret","6 June 2011","Now I may be biased about this movie over others due to the fact that I love watching Japanese cinema, but Harakiri was a well crafted and brilliantly well thought out movie made by Masaki Kobayashi. All the actors and actresses acted well on their individual roles. I enjoyed watching and learning the ways of the Samurai Culture. The Samurai Culture was all about obedience, honor and respect. However, one may question whether or not these samurai codes were too strict during these times. The way the film demonstrates Hara-Kiri in a well mannered and carefully crafted method in which does not disturb the viewers to the point where they would call it sickening or disturbing. I could it simply call it a beautiful, yet deadly ritual to acknowledge. The story, itself, is also very well made. There have been quite a few Japanese movies that have tried to implement a story in their rather interesting (quirky) plots, but fail to capitalize by making the film much more confusing. Most Japanese films these days also try to make their movies more vague and make their audience question the characters actions and story plot lines. However, this movie is straight forward and to the point. I really like this film and the way it was constructed. It gave me more insight of the life of the samurai. Even though it doesn't come close to my favorites Japanese movies such as Departures, Battle Royale, Spirited Away or Confessions, it does the subject of Harakiri justice where it fully explains the way of the samurai code well.","

Before watching it I had never watched a single Japanese samurai movie or anything related to it and I really enjoyed Hara-Kiri and how the Japanese culture was captured. Never would I think that a movie this slow would keep me alert and make me want to continue watching, it was almost what I believed made the movie so special, it's different from anything I have ever experienced. Fighting movies and movies about war in general are usually so brutal and extreme but this story takes its time, no rush and it makes it even more powerful!","

"twoteatoroomtwotwo","7 June 2011","Beautify crafted movie. I really enjoyed the visual side of ""Hara-kiri."" I appreciate simple and well balanced cinematography. This movie was another good example that simple composition and slow movement of the camera can have bigger impact than ""nowadays"" extremely busy, and showy cinematography. I like the fact that the film is black and white (1962). A strong contrast, really dark blacks and really bright whites, makes it visually really strong... which I think emphasizes the story, where we have this ""right and wrong"" (""black and white"") samurai honor code. I think that this movie is very universal in a sense of introduced cultural aspects and asked questions, which can be seen more general. What is more important: the life of their own families or following the rules to save their honor? Finally, what is the greater disgrace to the samurai, ""bend the neck"" and humiliate the time of the request, to commit suicide with hunger, or to lose hair-tip of samurai. The answer to these questions, in a context of the Japanese tradition, can not be easily answered... but I think we can ask ourself how strong are we impacted by cultural or social rules... and going further to realize that part of those who should protect the values and follow the rules, are the one who break them. There is one scene in the move I could not watch, hara-kiri with bamboo sword. It was really realistically shot- long take with a close-up. Even it was back and white and the blood did not look ""real"", I was really disturbed, but In the same time I think this scene was necessary to emphasize brutality and nonsense of hara-kiri. After watching final scene in this movie I have no doubt that Quentin Tarrantino, before he shoot ""Kill Bill"", has watched big masters of Japaniese cinema...","

"Maxence_G","31 July 2020","This movie came has an enormous surprise to me, while I anticipated an action-packed chanbara film, its plot is a tragedy, and his thematics are extremely relevant.In Seppuku, the authoritarian government takes the form of the feudal system. Kobayashi was certainly one of the most engaged directors on this topic.His genius is to transpose modern japan in the chanbara style using poetry and well-tough metaphors as well as an extremely engaging a universal narrative. Each character is motivation/emotion/aspiration can be defined by a simple glance at the characters' eyes, at a certain point, I noticed that the subtitles weren't necessary (and I don't speak a word of Japanese). This demonstrates how powerful the directing and the acting of the cast, and especially Tatsuya Nakadai are in this movie. I'm not even talking about the role that lighting an color grading had in this movie because they merit their own analysis!Sincerely, while this movie is indeed not the most action-packed jidaigeki film out there. It is without any doubt gonna be one of the most persistent in memories.","

"paulbegg-10281","2 December 2023","With a career spanning over 70 years, Tatsuya Nakadai starred in many great movies (out of the estimated 100 or so), however Hara-Kiri remains the pinnacle of his achievements; to which even he himself acknowledges, as perhaps his most important work. Yes, there are fantastic movies and then there's great movies.This is the only movie I have given a 10 rating, quite simply because it is pure excellence in which every scene is captivating and multi-layered in its emotional depth. Set in the 1600's in feudal Japan, it is a story of happiness turned desperation, leading ultimately to the cataclysmic act of ultimate revenge.The beauty of Hara-Kiri is how the story is told, as if you the viewer, are a witness to the unfortunate events presented. It is simple yet brilliant with an immaculate execution (pardon the pun) by Masaki Kobayashi, and it's not just a timeless classic, it's probably the greatest timeless classic... ever.","

"kurosawakira","15 January 2013","My favourite Kobayashi, and among my favourite Japanese films of all time, ""Harakiri"" (known in Japan as ""Seppuku""; the former is a spoken term, the latter a written one for the same thing, the former likely adopted in the West on the basis of some general awareness of the word) is a masterly exploration of space, symmetry, honour, disloyalty, tradition, modernity and truth.This film has one of the most amazing opening sequences ever. It goes beyond the best of Greenaway or Tarkovsky in how the camera moves and reveals a space, and I'd like to know whether Zhang Yimou considers this an influence on the similarly masterly ""Raise the Red Lantern"" (Da hong deng long gao gao gua, 1991). Especially the framing in the exterior shots is just as beautifully conveyed. Anyway, back to the sequence – there we are introduced to the idea of the ""house"": not only in the sense of ""assembly"" but also as a building. The main visual motif of the film (the courtyard scenes are another) is very theatrically revealed in shadow and light, and even before the narrative begins (we enter a book read to us, which again, appropriately, is not the whole truth).I am so in love with how the film looks and how the camera moves. Symmetries open, are revealed, tighten. There are amazingly patient tracking shots, especially in the interiors, where the camera sometimes barely moves at all.The performances are just as amazing as the rest of the craft. In fact, this film brings together two absolute icons. For me, Tatsuya Nakadai is the quintessential Japanese actor, even greater than Mifune. His presence is overwhelming, just as his humanity. His eyes speak more than a thousand words in mere glances. Rentarô Mikuni is another, and his work in Ichikawa's ""The Burmese Harp"" (Biruma no tategoto, 1956) and in Imamura's films (most notably in ""The Profound Desires of the Gods"" [1968] and ""Vengeance is Mine"" [1979]) adds tremendously to my viewing experience. There are two very good Blu-ray editions available for this, released by the Criterion Collection (Region A) and the Masters of Cinema series (Region B). The Criterion appears to be cropped on the sides to a surprisingly noticeable degree, however.","

By the time I finished watching this film I was stunned by how good it actually was and had me thinking that I shouldn't judge a book by it's cover. Although it's good the film does gets boring, mainly in the beginning then it has a roller-coaster of emotions, then the final showdown just leaves you stunned. The film itself is a masterpiece in Japanese cinema as this is the film that put Japan on the cinema map and laid the foundation for many other masterpieces from Japan. I would recommend this film to viewers who like samurai type films.","

"jay4stein79-1","1 April 2006","Kobayashi is one of the unsung heroes of Japanese cinema. Ozu and Kurosawa get all the ink, and they do so undeservedly to my mind. Kobayashi, Shinoda, and Mizoguchi do get respect, but their skill and artistry should elevate them above Kurosawa if not Ozu as well. Harakiri is, probably, my favorite samurai film, which, I think, derives from its willingness to talk and explore the concept of the samurai and the code of honor by which they abide. Harakiri seems, to me, to work on a number of levels, while most of Kurosawa's films operate on the most basic one. Rashomon digs deeper, but the rest seem content to exist as fun little action movies with great vistas. Harakiri is different. The setting also helps. The compound in which the action takes place is one of the most amazing sets I've encountered in any film. It seems magical to me, and the cinematography of the interiors is astounding. Like most people, I'm usually more struck by gorgeous photography of open land; interiors are harder to film in interesting ways. Harakiri manages to make the inside of the compound spare and, occasionally, unreal. It's magnificent. Overall, I think this film is immensely enjoyable and will appeal to anyone with an appreciation of Japanese cinema--especially those that would typically avoid a samurai movie.","

"anastasiiapodrez","16 June 2014","This is a very ambiguous movie. One commits seppuku whether his lord asks him to or he commits it because of the loss of faith. This story is about a ronin, basically an unemployed samurai. The protagonist in ""Harakiri"", Hanshiro, portrayed by Tatsuya Makadai, is the only one in the whole movie who actually follows the samurai code, and at the end he is killed by it. Violence takes place in the film as well, so make sure you are mentally prepared to watch people disemboweling themselves with bamboo swords. I enjoyed the emotional cut of the movie and instant shots which really reflect characters' despair and happy flashbacks from their past. Interesting choices were made by the director, Masaki Kobayashi, who has always been interested in the anti-establishment of the world, samurai culture in particular. Everything becomes really tragic when Hanshiro's friend performs seppuku, or when his daughter and grandson die Meanwhile, Hanshiro blindly follows the samurai's code and falls into dogmatism. He assumes seppuku is something true and follows the rules no matter what. Some scenes may seem funny for a contemporary viewer; Kobayashi was trying to add a little humor. Tragedy, politics, drama, and comedy The film has it all. I would recommend watching this film to those who are stricken by Japanese samurai movies.","

Angles and scenes are just perfect. Of course fight scenes are not as much brutal as we would see in Kill- Bill or other movies where people use swords, but the fact that in this movie they used real swords its frightening.The main point of the main character to come and cut his belly is not just because of situation of his life but also to give honor for those who passed away before and also to point out the problem of dogmatic point of view of high ranked people which actually pointing some interesting thoughts about life in Japan at period of time when movie was made.If amazing cinematography and issues that viable today are not enough to make you watch this movie than just watch it to know what is it ""To be Ronin"" or who are samurais and what was the time of samurais when Japan was extremely distant. I'm not saying that this movie tell the truth about Japan before 1615 but at least it give you a very interesting option of how it could be.Might warn you that movie is pretty long and mostly based on dialogs and flash-backs so if you want sword massacre then watch Kill Bill.",NA

They became beggars and men without hope. There was no work for them. Some then turned to a the realities of the Samurai code. This was Harakiri, which is the ritual disemboweling of the self with a sword in front of a group of clan members. Making things more complicated is that some of those leaders stepped in and provided charity for these men, leading to a wave of them seeking money. But in this one, a young man whose real story we don't know till the end, presents himself for self execution and then wants to go away for a while. He is kept there and eventually, using a bamboo sword, takes his life. But the big story is a man, connected to this young man, who also presents himself, and he tells a tale that is so sad.

This is a movie with a serious theme means through this old, black and white movie, people can get to know the Japanese samurai history in the specific time period(1619-1630). This movie also can be considered as a historic documentary.According to the plot, it was pretty simple— a déclassé samurai whose daughter and grandchild were sick, the son in law had to go to Kageyu Saito's house to beg for some money by choosing harakiri in front of Saito's house. But Saito did not want to know the reason that forced son in law seppuku by using a bamboo katana. Then the samurai fought back, criticized ruthless rulers and exposed their hypocrisy. As a result, the authorities got angry, and the samurai was too weak to fought the group of the authority's followers, and end up with tragic death. In the end, the matter was covered up by the authority, and no one knows. In Masaki Kobayashi's movie ""Harakiri"", it contained two strictly parallel corresponding stories. From the structure, these two stories were divided into serval parts, and were orderly placed into the plot according to the rhythm and the progress of the story in order to create a rigorous form so that the movie would have a significant theatrical feature.For people, it is natural to love, to be loved, and to survive. There would no reason for people to questioning their love for their family, and sometimes, people would do anything to protect their family just like what Chijima Motome did, and it is hard for someone to despicable or judge him.

I don't think I have ever had such a reaction to blood and gore in a film as I did in Harakiri. It got me to my feet. I completely respect his decision to show those elements, as they were completely necessary. This choice commanded that the viewer recognize from the very beginning that this was not just a story of life and death but a tale with deeper meaning. Isolationism was the overall theme of this movie, and Kobayashi does a spectacular job of sticking to this. Whenever we see Hanshiro telling his story from the courtyard we are overwhelmed with this sense of isolation, an every man for himself type of feeling.Cinematically speaking, the choices made in this arena felt ironically inviting and apprehensive simultaneously. Kobayashi makes the choice to shoot the majority of the film at kneeling height or eye level, because that is where the majority of people remained throughout the entire film.

As soon as the heyday of the Taiping arrived, there was no need to fight anymore, and Bushido gradually became empty furnishings and forms. Young warriors have hardly ever seen war, and warriors have only become a symbol of identity and status. Like the armor of the ancestor worshipped on the altar, it will not be used for a long time, and it has lost its original meaning and has become a meaningless worship. Bushido, like feudal autocracy, is rigid, degenerate, and decaying. The big name is to maintain the dignity of Bushido, in fact, to maintain the identity and pomp of his nobility.
The film illustrates the decline and deterioration of this Bushido from three different directions.
To the beggar, he was a young warrior, and he also lacked a deep understanding of these tedious warrior temperaments and spirits. However, he is also a simple man, a law-abiding person. However, in the face of the burden of the family, he had to let go of this spiritual pursuit, facing the cruel reality, and sold his sabre with pain. A man who has abandoned all dignity for his wife and children is miserable and bears humiliation. For him, Bushido is just a spiritual obsession, a distant cold spiritual pursuit. He couldn't reach it, so, like a deadly law, he was finally abandoned in the presence of a warm and tangible family.

Anyone can be a dogmatic follower only a few can think freely and passionately enough to be a counterforce to wrong acts that are seen as societal norms. You can definitely feel that Mizoguchi was influenced by the French New way in terms of how he decides to tell the story—it's not particularly in chronological order.

The movie starts out slow with the dialog, because the pace of the scenes and the actors are soothing on a monotone level (I understand that with the Samurais in a sacred place, that is part of their mannerism and culture). However, the more you watch the film, the pace starts to pick up as you listen to the story play on by (there are a series of flashbacks implemented into the scene). As you progress into the film, it turns out that the Samurai is looking for an honorable death, but he is also there to mock the code of the Bushido, and the unbalance that exists within the system that cost him his son in law's life in a horrid way, who he cared for as a son.Kobayashi takes us on a journey about how man, in a corrupted system, tends to either dehumanize us into walking robots, or giving us a choice to find balance in society. I though this was brilliant of him to put this film together, especially since he was a soldier himself, and got persecuted for similar parallel circumstances (not the suicide, but the system of ""doing your job"" in a military stance). Tatsuya Nakadai (who played Samurai Hanshiro Tsugumo) did a brilliant job and stole the show.

So naturally, I was really excited to see Harakiri, the movie many people call his magnum opus, and I can say now that is definitely for a very good reason. This movie was absolutely outstanding. First of all, I really loved the pacing of the story, and how it revealed information in a very suspenseful way, that created this amazing buildup towards the end of the movie. On a personal level, this story is very harrowing. There are many scenes in this movie that I would consider to be some of the most heartbreaking and painful scenes I've ever seen. These moments are highlighted with fantastic acting, especially by Tatsuya Nakadai, whose performance in The Human Condition is one of my all-time favorites, and his performance in this movie is also definitely up there. The movie also deals with themes like honor, especially in the historical context of the Japanese samurai code, and criticizes this authoritarian culture within the samurai clans, in a very thought-provoking and interesting way. I really liked the use of music in this movie, which is very minimalistic. The black and white cinematography was outstanding. Especially framing and camera movement were excellent. Harakiri is of the greatest masterpieces in cinema history, and Masaki Kobayashi blew me away once again. I haven't seen most of his filmography yet but I can already say he is one of the greatest movie directors of all time for me.",NA
