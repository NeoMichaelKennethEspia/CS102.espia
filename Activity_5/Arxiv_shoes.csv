"1","Stepping into the Right Shoes: The Effects of User-Matched Avatar Ethnicity and Gender on Sense of Embodiment in Virtual Reality","Tiffany D. Do, Camille Isabella Protko, Ryan P. McMahan","Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)","In many consumer virtual reality (VR) applications, users embody predefined characters that offer minimal customization options, frequently emphasizing storytelling over user choice. We explore whether matching a user's physical characteristics, specifically ethnicity and gender, with their virtual self-avatar affects their sense of embodiment in VR. We conducted a 2 x 2 within-subjects experiment (n=32) with a diverse user population to explore the impact of matching or not matching a user's self-avatar to their ethnicity and gender on their sense of embodiment. Our results indicate that matching the ethnicity of the user and their self-avatar significantly enhances sense of embodiment regardless of gender, extending across various aspects, including appearance, response, and ownership. We also found that matching gender significantly enhanced ownership, suggesting that this aspect is influenced by matching both ethnicity and gender. Interestingly, we found that matching ethnicity specifically affects self-location while matching gender specifically affects one's body ownership.","Mon, 5 Feb 2024 18:36:11 UTC (6,885 KB)[v2] Tue, 6 Feb 2024 19:45:52 UTC (6,885 KB)[v3] Sat, 10 Feb 2024 19:47:12 UTC (6,885 KB)"

"3","Instilling Multi-round Thinking to Text-guided Image Generation","Lidong Zeng, Zhedong Zheng, Yinwei Wei, Tat-seng Chua","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","This paper delves into the text-guided image editing task, focusing on modifying a reference image according to user-specified textual feedback to embody specific attributes. Despite recent advancements, a persistent challenge remains that the single-round generation often overlooks crucial details, particularly in the realm of fine-grained changes like shoes or sleeves. This issue compounds over multiple rounds of interaction, severely limiting customization quality. In an attempt to address this challenge, we introduce a new self-supervised regularization, \ie, multi-round regularization, which is compatible with existing methods. Specifically, the multi-round regularization encourages the model to maintain consistency across different modification orders. It builds upon the observation that the modification order generally should not affect the final result. Different from traditional one-round generation, the mechanism underpinning the proposed method is the error amplification of initially minor inaccuracies in capturing intricate details. Qualitative and quantitative experiments affirm that the proposed method achieves high-fidelity editing quality, especially the local modification, in both single-round and multiple-round generation, while also showcasing robust generalization to irregular text inputs. The effectiveness of our semantic alignment with textual feedback is further substantiated by the retrieval improvements on FahisonIQ and Fashion200k.","Tue, 16 Jan 2024 16:19:58 UTC (7,944 KB)[v2] Sat, 9 Mar 2024 15:52:05 UTC (14,047 KB)"

A rationally tailored midsole can potentially mitigate plantar pressure, improving performance and comfort levels. Despite the importance of midsole design, the potential of using in-plane density gradation in midsole has been rarely explored in earlier studies. The present work investigates the effectiveness of in-plane density gradation in shoe midsoles using a new class of polyurea foams as the material candidate. Their excellent cushioning properties justify the use of polyurea foams. Different polyurea foam densities, ranging from 95 to 350 kg/m3 are examined and tested to construct density-dependent correlative mathematical relations required for the optimization process. An optimization framework is then created to allocate foam densities at certain plantar zones based on the required cushioning performance constrained by the local pressures. The interior-point algorithm was used to solve the constrained optimization problem. The optimization algorithm introduces a novel approach, utilizing the maximum specific energy absorption as the objective function. The optimization process identifies specific foam densities at various plantar regions for maximum biomechanical energy dissipation without incurring additional weight penalties. Our results suggest midsole design can benefit from horizontal (in-plane) density gradation, leading to potential weight reduction and localized cushioning improvements. With local plantar peak pressure data analysis, the optimization results indicate low-density polyurea foams (140 kg/m3) for central and lateral phalanges, whereas stiffer foams (185-230 kg/m3) are identified as suitable candidates for metatarsal and arch regions in an in-plane density graded midsole design.","Sat, 13 Jan 2024 00:36:35 UTC (780 KB)"
"5","What Else Would I Like? A User Simulator using Alternatives for Improved Evaluation of Fashion Conversational Recommendation Systems","Maria Vlachou, Craig Macdonald","Information Retrieval (cs.IR)","In Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS), a user can provide feedback on recommended items at each interaction turn, leading the CRS towards more desirable recommendations. Currently, different types of CRS offer various possibilities for feedback, i.e., natural language feedback, or answering clarifying questions. In most cases, a user simulator is employed for training as well as evaluating the CRS. Such user simulators typically critique the current retrieved items based on knowledge of a single target item. Still, evaluating systems in offline settings with simulators suffers from problems, such as focusing entirely on a single target item (not addressing the exploratory nature of a recommender system), and exhibiting extreme patience (consistent feedback over a large number of turns). To overcome these limitations, we obtain extra judgements for a selection of alternative items in common CRS datasets, namely Shoes and Fashion IQ Dresses. Going further, we propose improved user simulators that allow simulated users not only to express their preferences about alternative items to their original target, but also to change their mind and level of patience. In our experiments using the relative image captioning CRS setting and different CRS models, we find that using the knowledge of alternatives by the simulator can have a considerable impact on the evaluation of existing CRS models, specifically that the existing single-target evaluation underestimates their effectiveness, and when simulated users are allowed to instead consider alternatives, the system can rapidly respond to more quickly satisfy the user.","Thu, 11 Jan 2024 09:37:32 UTC (413 KB)"
"6","Grasping, Part Identification, and Pose Refinement in One Shot with a Tactile Gripper","Joyce Xin-Yan Lim, Quang-Cuong Pham","Robotics (cs.RO)","The rise in additive manufacturing comes with unique opportunities and challenges. Rapid changes to part design and massive part customization distinctive to 3D-Print (3DP) can be easily achieved. Customized parts that are unique, yet exhibit similar features such as dental moulds, shoe insoles, or engine vanes could be industrially manufactured with 3DP. However, the opportunity for massive part customization comes with unique challenges for the existing production paradigm of robotics applications, as the current robotics paradigm for part identification and pose refinement is repetitive, where data-driven and object-dependent approaches are often used. Thus, a bottleneck exists in robotics applications for 3DP parts where massive customization is involved, as it is difficult for feature-based deep learning approaches to distinguish between similar parts such as shoe insoles belonging to different people. As such, we propose a method that augments patterns on 3DP parts so that grasping, part identification, and pose refinement can be executed in one shot with a tactile gripper. We also experimentally evaluate our approach from three perspectives, including real insertion tasks that mimic robotic sorting and packing, and achieved excellent classification results, a high insertion success rate of 95%, and a sub-millimeter pose refinement accuracy.","Fri, 29 Dec 2023 15:34:39 UTC (7,976 KB)"
"7","Understanding Inter-Session Intentions via Complex Logical Reasoning","Jiaxin Bai, Chen Luo, Zheng Li, Qingyu Yin, Yangqiu Song","Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)","Understanding user intentions is crucial for enhancing product recommendations, navigation suggestions, and query reformulations. However, user intentions can be complex, involving multiple sessions and attribute requirements connected by logical operators such as And, Or, and Not. For example, a user may search for Nike or Adidas running shoes across various sessions, with a preference for the color purple. In another case, a user may have purchased a mattress in a previous session and is now seeking a corresponding bed frame without intending to buy another mattress. Prior research on session understanding has not sufficiently addressed how to make product or attribute recommendations for such complex intentions. In this paper, we introduce the task of logical session complex query answering, where sessions are treated as hyperedges of items, and we formulate the problem of complex intention understanding as a task of logical session complex queries answering (LS-CQA) on an aggregated hypergraph of sessions, items, and attributes. The proposed task is a special type of complex query answering task with sessions as ordered hyperedges. We also propose a new model, the Logical Session Graph Transformer (LSGT), which captures interactions among items across different sessions and their logical connections using a transformer structure. We analyze the expressiveness of LSGT and prove the permutation invariance of the inputs for the logical operators. We evaluate LSGT on three datasets and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art results.","Thu, 21 Dec 2023 14:03:30 UTC (364 KB)"

Typical approaches urge models to predict specific contents of masked tokens, which can be intuitively considered as teaching a student (the model) to solve given problems (predicting masked contents). Under such settings, the performance is highly correlated with mask strategies (the difficulty of provided problems). We argue that it is equally important for the model to stand in the shoes of a teacher to produce challenging problems by itself. Intuitively, patches with high values of reconstruction loss can be regarded as hard samples, and masking those hard patches naturally becomes a demanding reconstruction task. To empower the model as a teacher, we propose Hard Patches Mining (HPM), predicting patch-wise losses and subsequently determining where to mask. Technically, we introduce an auxiliary loss predictor, which is trained with a relative objective to prevent overfitting to exact loss values. Also, to gradually guide the training procedure, we propose an easy-to-hard mask strategy. Empirically, HPM brings significant improvements under both image and video benchmarks. Interestingly, solely incorporating the extra loss prediction objective leads to better representations, verifying the efficacy of determining where is hard to reconstruct.

The resulting $\Omega_{\rm m0}h^2$ constraint is $\Omega_{\rm m0}h^2=0.139\pm0.017$. Incorporating $H_0$ measurements, we find $\Omega_{\rm m0}$ values from CC data ($0.308\pm0.057$), tip of the Red Giant Branch ($0.285\pm0.038$), and SHOES measurements ($0.259\pm0.033$). Interestingly, a higher mean $H_0$ correlates with a lower mean $\Omega_{\rm m0}$. In summary, our cosmological model-independent approach offers valuable constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m0}$, affirming the consistency of FLRW and Newtonian perturbation theory.","Wed, 22 Nov 2023 16:16:42 UTC (46 KB)"

The paw end-effector is made of silicon that deforms upon the application of contact forces, while an embedded micro camera is utilized to capture images of the deformed inner surface inside the shoe, and a microphone picks up audio signals. Processed through machine learning techniques, the images are mapped to compute an accurate estimate of the cumulative 3D force vector, while the audio signals are analyzed to identify the terrain class (e.g., gravel, snow). By leveraging its on-edge computation ability, the paw enhances the capabilities of legged robots by providing key information in real-time that can be used to adapt locomotion control strategies. To assess the performance of this novel sensorized paw, we conducted experiments on the data collected through a specially-designed testbed for force estimation, as well as data from recordings of the audio signatures of different terrains interacting with the paw. The results demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the system, highlighting its potential for improving legged robot performance.","Tue, 7 Nov 2023 10:13:12 UTC (10,330 KB)"

However, most of the current studies on player re-identification in multi- or single-view sports videos focus on re-identification in the closed-world setting using labeled image dataset, and player re-identification in the open-world setting for automatic video analysis is not well developed. In this paper, we propose a runner re-identification system that directly processes single-view video to address the open-world setting. In the open-world setting, we cannot use labeled dataset and have to process video directly. The proposed system automatically processes raw video as input to identify runners, and it can identify runners even when they are framed out multiple times. For the automatic processing, we first detect the runners in the video using the pre-trained YOLOv8 and the fine-tuned EfficientNet. We then track the runners using ByteTrack and detect their shoes with the fine-tuned YOLOv8. Finally, we extract the image features of the runners using an unsupervised method using the gated recurrent unit autoencoder model. To improve the accuracy of runner re-identification, we use dynamic features of running sequence images. We evaluated the system on a running practice video dataset and showed that the proposed method identified runners with higher accuracy than one of the state-of-the-art models in unsupervised re-identification. We also showed that our unsupervised running dynamic feature extractor was effective for runner re-identification. Our runner re-identification system can be useful for the automatic analysis of running videos.","Wed, 18 Oct 2023 04:15:39 UTC (2,147 KB)"
"13","Optimized shock-protecting microstructures","Zizhou Huang, Daniele Panozzo, Denis Zorin","Optimization and Control (math.OC)","Mechanical shock is a common occurrence in various settings, there are two different scenarios for shock protection: catastrophic protection (e.g. car collisions and falls) and routine protection (e.g. shoe soles and shock absorbers for car seats). The former protects against one-time events, the latter against periodic shocks and loads. Common shock absorbers based on plasticity and fracturing materials are suitable for the former, while our focus is on the latter, where elastic structures are useful. Improved elastic materials protecting against shock can be used in applications such as automotive suspension, furniture like sofas and mattresses, landing gear systems, etc. Materials offering optimal protection against shock have a highly non-linear elastic response: their reaction force needs to be as close as possible to constant with respect to deformation. In this paper, we use shape optimization and topology search to design 2D families of microstructures approximating the ideal behavior across a range of deformations, leading to superior shock protection. We present an algorithmic pipeline for the optimal design of such families combining differentiable nonlinear homogenization with self-contact and an optimization algorithm. These advanced 2D designs can be extruded and fabricated with existing 3D printing technologies.

Sahoo, Tiberiu Harko","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)","In modern cosmology, the curiosity of ultimately understanding the nature of the dark energy controlling the recent acceleration of the Universe motivates us to explore its properties by using some novel approaches. In this work, to explore the properties of dark energy we adopt the modified $f(Q)$ gravity theory, where the non-metricity scalar $Q$, emerging from Weyl geometry, plays the dynamical role. For the function $f(Q)$ we adopt the functional form $f(Q)=Q+ 6\gamma\,H_0^2(Q/Q_0)^n$, where $n,\, \gamma,\, H_0$ and $Q_0$ are constants. Then, we test our constructed model against the various observational datasets, such as the Hubble, and the Pantheon+SHOES samples, and their combined sample, through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) statistical analysis. We also employ the parameter estimation technique to constrain the free parameters of the model. In addition, we use the constrained values of the model parameters to explore a few implications of the cosmological model. A detailed comparison of the predictions of our model with the $\Lambda$CDM model is also performed. In particular, we discuss in detail some cosmographic parameters, like the deceleration, the jerk, and the snap parameters, as well as the behavior of the dark energy and matter energy densities to see the evolution of various energy/matter profiles. The $Om$ diagnostics is also presented to test the dark energy nature of our model, as compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our findings show that the considered version of the non-metric $f(Q)$ type modified gravity theory, despite some differences with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, can still explain the current observational results on the cosmological parameters, and provide a convincing and consistent account for the accelerating expansion of the Universe.","Fri, 29 Sep 2023 04:56:29 UTC (994 KB)[v2] Sat, 16 Dec 2023 08:25:33 UTC (989 KB)"

The primary objective is to identify a specific individual within a gallery of images. However, this task is challenging due to various factors, such as pose variations, illumination changes, obstructions, and the presence ofconfusing backgrounds. Existing ReID methods often fail to capture discriminative features (e.g., head, shoes, backpacks) and instead capture irrelevant features when the target is occluded.

Existing 3D human generative models mainly generate a clothed 3D human as an undetectable 3D model in a single pass, while rarely considering the layer-wise nature of a clothed human body, which often consists of the human body and various clothes such as underwear, outerwear, trousers, shoes, etc. In this work, we propose HumanLiff, the first layer-wise 3D human generative model with a unified diffusion process. Specifically, HumanLiff firstly generates minimal-clothed humans, represented by tri-plane features, in a canonical space, and then progressively generates clothes in a layer-wise manner. In this way, the 3D human generation is thus formulated as a sequence of diffusion-based 3D conditional generation. To reconstruct more fine-grained 3D humans with tri-plane representation, we propose a tri-plane shift operation that splits each tri-plane into three sub-planes and shifts these sub-planes to enable feature grid subdivision. To further enhance the controllability of 3D generation with 3D layered conditions, HumanLiff hierarchically fuses tri-plane features and 3D layered conditions to facilitate the 3D diffusion model learning. Extensive experiments on two layer-wise 3D human datasets, SynBody (synthetic) and TightCap (real-world), validate that HumanLiff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in layer-wise 3D human generation.

Accurate assessment of the lower limbs' motor ability is important for diagnosis and rehabilitation. To digitalize such assessment so that each test can be traced back any time and subjectivity can be avoided, we test how dual-modality smart shoes equipped with pressure-sensitive insoles and inertial measurement units can be used for this purpose. A 5m walking test protocol, including the left and right turns, is designed. Data are collected from 23 patients and 17 healthy subjects. For the lower limbs' motor ability, the tests are observed by two physicians and assessed using the five graded Medical Research Council scale for muscle examination. The average of two physicians' scores for the same patient is used as the ground truth.

The key limitations encountered by existing efforts are two aspects: 1) ignoring the multi-faceted query-target matching factors; 2) ignoring the potential unlabeled reference-target image pairs in existing benchmark datasets. To address these two limitations is non-trivial due to the following challenges: 1) how to effectively model the multi-faceted matching factors in a latent way without direct supervision signals; 2) how to fully utilize the potential unlabeled reference-target image pairs to improve the generalization ability of the CIR model. To address these challenges, in this work, we first propose a muLtI-faceted Matching Network (LIMN), which consists of three key modules: multi-grained image/text encoder, latent factor-oriented feature aggregation, and query-target matching modeling. Thereafter, we design an iterative dual self-training paradigm to further enhance the performance of LIMN by fully utilizing the potential unlabeled reference-target image pairs in a semi-supervised manner. Specifically, we denote the iterative dual self-training paradigm enhanced LIMN as LIMN+. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, FashionIQ, Shoes, and Birds-to-Words, show that our proposed method significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines.","Wed, 17 May 2023 06:23:06 UTC (3,960 KB)"

The framework opens the opportunity for fast indoor acoustic data generation and positioning development. The improved Pyroomacoustics-based physical model includes both an image-source model (ISM) and ray tracing method to simulate acoustic signaling in geometric spaces that extend typical shoe-box rooms. Moreover, it offers the convenience to facilitate multiple speakers and microphones with different directivity patterns. In addition to temperature and air absorption, the room reverberation is taken into account characterized by the RT60 value or the combination of building materials. Additional noise sources can be added by means of post processing and/or extra speakers. Indoor positioning methods assessed in simulation are compared with real measurements in a testbed, called 'Techtile'. This analysis confirms that the simulation results are close to the measurements and form a realistic representation of the reality. The simulation framework is constructed in a modular way, and parts can be replaced or modified to support different application domains. The code is made available open source.","Thu, 4 May 2023 10:37:34 UTC (587 KB)[v2] Wed, 21 Jun 2023 14:28:57 UTC (1,060 KB)"

Kim, Rana Hanocka","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","We present a technique for automatically producing a deformation of an input triangle mesh, guided solely by a text prompt. Our framework is capable of deformations that produce both large, low-frequency shape changes, and small high-frequency details. Our framework relies on differentiable rendering to connect geometry to powerful pre-trained image encoders, such as CLIP and DINO. Notably, updating mesh geometry by taking gradient steps through differentiable rendering is notoriously challenging, commonly resulting in deformed meshes with significant artifacts. These difficulties are amplified by noisy and inconsistent gradients from CLIP. To overcome this limitation, we opt to represent our mesh deformation through Jacobians, which updates deformations in a global, smooth manner (rather than locally-sub-optimal steps). Our key observation is that Jacobians are a representation that favors smoother, large deformations, leading to a global relation between vertices and pixels, and avoiding localized noisy gradients. Additionally, to ensure the resulting shape is coherent from all 3D viewpoints, we encourage the deep features computed on the 2D encoding of the rendering to be consistent for a given vertex from all viewpoints. We demonstrate that our method is capable of smoothly-deforming a wide variety of source mesh and target text prompts, achieving both large modifications to, e.g., body proportions of animals, as well as adding fine semantic details, such as shoe laces on an army boot and fine details of a face.","Wed, 26 Apr 2023 07:38:41 UTC (6,838 KB)"

In typical approaches, models usually focus on predicting specific contents of masked patches, and their performances are highly related to pre-defined mask strategies. Intuitively, this procedure can be considered as training a student (the model) on solving given problems (predict masked patches). However, we argue that the model should not only focus on solving given problems, but also stand in the shoes of a teacher to produce a more challenging problem by itself. To this end, we propose Hard Patches Mining (HPM), a brand-new framework for MIM pre-training. We observe that the reconstruction loss can naturally be the metric of the difficulty of the pre-training task. Therefore, we introduce an auxiliary loss predictor, predicting patch-wise losses first and deciding where to mask next. It adopts a relative relationship learning strategy to prevent overfitting to exact reconstruction loss values. Experiments under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of HPM in constructing masked images. Furthermore, we empirically find that solely introducing the loss prediction objective leads to powerful representations, verifying the efficacy of the ability to be aware of where is hard to reconstruct.","Wed, 12 Apr 2023 15:38:23 UTC (8,690 KB)"

Currently, existing systems either focus on one single limb or one single class of movements. Many proposed systems are designed to be used in an indoor controlled environment and must possess good technical know-how to operate. To improve mobility, a less restrictive, modularized, and simple Inertial Measurement units based system is proposed that can be worn separately and combined. This allows the user to measure singular limb movements separately and also monitor whole body movements over a prolonged period at any given time while not restricted to a controlled environment. For proper analysis, data is conditioned and pre-processed through possible five stages namely power-based, clustering index-based, Kalman filtering, distance-measure-based, and PCA-based dimension reduction. Different combinations of the above stages are analyzed using machine learning algorithms for selected case studies namely hand gesture recognition and environment and shoe parameter-based walking pattern analysis to validate the performance capability of the proposed wearable device and multi-stage algorithms. The results of the case studies show that distance-measure-based and PCA-based dimension reduction will significantly improve human motion identification accuracy. This is further improved with the introduction of the Kalman filter. An LSTM neural network is proposed as an alternate classifier and the results indicate that it is a robust classifier for human motion recognition. As the results indicate, the proposed wearable device architecture and multi-stage algorithms are cable of distinguishing between subtle human limb movements making it a viable tool for human motion analysis.","Wed, 29 Mar 2023 05:52:22 UTC (37,063 KB)"

We consider three kinds of dark energy models: the $\Lambda$CDM model, the wCDM model, and the CPL parametrization. In all these three models, we find higher values of the matter-energy density parameter, $\Omega_{\rm m0}$ compared to the one obtained from the Planck 2018 mission of CMB observation. Also, we find evidence for a nonflat and closed Universe at 0.5$\sigma$ to 3$\sigma$ confidence levels. The flat Universe is almost 2 to 3$\sigma$, 1 to 1.5$\sigma$, and 0.5 to 1$\sigma$ away from the corresponding mean values, obtained in $\Lambda$CDM model, wCDM model, and CPL parametrization respectively obtained from different combinations of datasets. The evidence for nonzero cosmic curvature is lesser in dynamical dark energy models compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. That means the evidence of nonzero cosmic curvature depends on the behavior of the equation of state of the dark energy. Since the values of the cosmic curvature are degenerate to the equation of state of the dark energy, we also consider a model independent analysis to constrain the cosmic curvature using the combination of Gaussian process regression analysis and artificial neural networks analysis. In the model independent analysis, we also find evidence for a closed Universe, and the flat Universe is almost 1$\sigma$ away. So, both the model dependent and independent analyses favor a closed Universe from the combinations of CC, QSO, and $H_0$ observations.","Mon, 27 Mar 2023 17:19:01 UTC (3,356 KB)[v2] Tue, 28 Mar 2023 17:39:25 UTC (3,356 KB)"

They accounted for 3.3% of worldwide trades in 2016, having an estimated value of $509 billion in the same year. While estimations are mostly based on border seizures, we examined openly labeled counterfeits on darknet markets, which allowed us to gather and analyze information from a different perspective. Here, we analyzed data from 11 darknet markets for the period Jan-2014 and Sep-2015. The findings suggest that darknet markets harbor similar counterfeit product types as found in seizures but that the share of watches is higher and lower for electronics, clothes, shoes, and Tobacco on darknet markets. Also, darknet market counterfeits seem to have similar shipping origins as seized goods, with some exceptions, such as a relatively high share (5%) of dark market counterfeits originating from the US. Lastly, counterfeits on dark markets tend to have a relatively low price and sales volume. However, based on preliminary estimations, the original products on the surface web seem to be worth a multiple of the prices of the counterfeit counterparts on darknet markets. Gathering insights about counterfeits from darknet markets can be valuable for businesses and authorities and be cost-effective compared to border seizures. Thus, monitoring darknet markets can help us understand the counterfeit landscape better.","Tue, 6 Dec 2022 13:02:47 UTC (2,376 KB)[v2] Tue, 24 Oct 2023 15:42:17 UTC (1,033 KB)"

That is because items have to be both compatible amongst each other and also personalized to match the taste of the customer. Recently there has been a plethora of work targeted at tackling these problems by adopting various techniques and algorithms from the machine learning literature. However, to date, there is no extensive comparison of the performance of the different algorithms for outfit generation and recommendation.

Users gradually look for the target of interest by moving from coarse to fine-grained feedback. However, existing methods merely focus on the latter, i.e., fine-grained search, by harnessing positive and negative pairs during training. This pair-based paradigm only considers the one-to-one distance between a pair of specific points, which is not aligned with the one-to-many coarse-grained retrieval process and compromises the recall rate. In an attempt to fill this gap, we introduce a unified learning approach to simultaneously modeling the coarse- and fine-grained retrieval by considering the multi-grained uncertainty. The key idea underpinning the proposed method is to integrate fine- and coarse-grained retrieval as matching data points with small and large fluctuations, respectively. Specifically, our method contains two modules: uncertainty modeling and uncertainty regularization. (1) The uncertainty modeling simulates the multi-grained queries by introducing identically distributed fluctuations in the feature space. (2) Based on the uncertainty modeling, we further introduce uncertainty regularization to adapt the matching objective according to the fluctuation range. Compared with existing methods, the proposed strategy explicitly prevents the model from pushing away potential candidates in the early stage, and thus improves the recall rate.

This is an intermediate filament (IF) that appeared on the solar disk for the first time at 02:00 UT on 2015 November 7, and took 8 days to move to the central median on the solar disk. The active region AR 12452 around which the filament occurred was diffuse so that the magnetic field nearby was weak, the average field strength is 106 G. Therefore, the existing approaches to extrapolating the coronal magnetic field and to constructing the filament configuration in the region with strong background field do not work well here. On the basis of the regularized Biot-Savart laws method, we successfully constructed a data-constrained, non-linear force-free field configuration for this IF observed on 2015 November 14. The overall IF configuration obtained in this way matches well the morphology suggested by a 304~Å\ image taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board Solar Dynamics Observatory. Magnetic dips in the configuration were coincident in space with the H$\alpha$ features of the filament, which is lower in altitude than the features seen in 304~Å. This suggests that the cold plasma fills the lower part of the filament, and hot plasma is situated in the higher region. A quasi-separatrix layer wraps the filament, and both the magnetic field and the electric current are stronger near the inner edge of the filament.","Wed, 9 Nov 2022 12:26:28 UTC (27,915 KB)"

ViNL consists of: (1) a visual navigation policy that outputs linear and angular velocity commands that guides the robot to a goal coordinate in unfamiliar indoor environments; and (2) a visual locomotion policy that controls the robot's joints to avoid stepping on obstacles while following provided velocity commands. Both the policies are entirely ""model-free"", i.e. sensors-to-actions neural networks trained end-to-end. The two are trained independently in two entirely different simulators and then seamlessly co-deployed by feeding the velocity commands from the navigator to the locomotor, entirely ""zero-shot"" (without any co-training).

On the task of navigation to distant goals in unknown environments, ViNL using just egocentric vision significantly outperforms prior work on robust locomotion using privileged terrain maps (+32.8% success and -4.42 collisions per meter).

We collect public near-infrared photometry of up to 19 calibrator SNe Ia and further 57 SNe Ia in the Hubble flow ($z>0.01$), and directly measure their peak magnitudes in the $J$ and $H$ band by Gaussian processes and spline interpolation. Calibrator peak magnitudes together with Cepheid-based distances are used to estimate the average absolute magnitude in each band, while Hubble-flow SNe are used to constrain the zero-point intercept of the magnitude-redshift relation. Our baseline result of $H_0$ is $72.3\pm1.4$ (stat) $\pm1.4$ (syst) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the $J$ band and $72.3\pm1.3$ (stat) $\pm1.4$ (syst) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the $H$ band, where the systematic uncertainties include the standard deviation of up to 21 variations of the analysis, the 0.7\% distance scale systematic from SHOES Cepheid anchors, a photometric zeropoint systematic, and a cosmic variance systematic. Our final measurement represents a measurement with a precision of 2.8\% in both bands.

Based on our results, in order to improve the precision of the $H_0$ measurement with SNe Ia in the NIR in the future, we would need to increase the number of calibrator SNe Ia, be able to extend the Hubble-Lemaître diagram to higher-z, and include standardization procedures to help reducing the NIR intrinsic scatter.","Tue, 6 Sep 2022 14:56:01 UTC (10,699 KB)[v2] Mon, 18 Sep 2023 08:44:16 UTC (13,510 KB)"
"45","T-Person-GAN: Text-to-Person Image Generation with Identity-Consistency and Manifold Mix-Up","Deyin Liu, Lin Yuanbo Wu, Bo Li, Zongyuan Ge","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","In this paper, we present an end-to-end approach to generate high-resolution person images conditioned on texts only. State-of-the-art text-to-image generation models are mainly designed for center-object generation, e.g., flowers and birds. Unlike center-placed objects with similar shapes and orientation, person image generation is a more challenging task, for which we observe the followings: 1) the generated images for the same person exhibit visual details with identity-consistency, e.g., identity-related textures/clothes/shoes across the images, and 2) those images should be discriminant for being robust against the inter-person variations caused by visual ambiguities. To address the above challenges, we develop an effective generative model to produce person images with two novel mechanisms. In particular, our first mechanism (called T-Person-GAN-ID) is to integrate the one-stream generator with an identity-preserving network such that the representations of generated data are regularized in their feature space to ensure the identity-consistency. The second mechanism (called T-Person-GAN-ID-MM) is based on the manifold mix-up to produce mixed images via the linear interpolation across generated images from different manifold identities, and we further enforce such interpolated images to be linearly classified in the feature space. This amounts to learning a linear classification boundary that can perfectly separate images from two identities. Our proposed method is empirically validated to achieve a remarkable improvement in text-to-person image generation. Our architecture is orthogonal to StackGAN++ , and focuses on person image generation, with all of them together to enrich the spectrum of GANs for the image generation task.

Curvagons are flexible regular polygon building blocks that allow you to quickly build anything from hyperbolic surfaces and tori to dinosaurs and shoes.

In this work, we extend multi-round conversational recommendation (MCR) to alleviate these issues. MCR, which uses a conversational paradigm to elicit user interests by asking user preferences on tags (e.g., categories or attributes) and handling user feedback across multiple rounds, is an emerging recommendation setting to acquire user feedback and narrow down the output space, but has not been explored in the context of bundle recommendation. In this work, we propose a novel recommendation task named Bundle MCR. We first propose a new framework to formulate Bundle MCR as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with multiple agents, for user modeling, consultation and feedback handling in bundle contexts. Under this framework, we propose a model architecture, called Bundle Bert (Bunt) to (1) recommend items, (2) post questions and (3) manage conversations based on bundle-aware conversation states. Moreover, to train Bunt effectively, we propose a two-stage training strategy. In an offline pre-training stage, Bunt is trained using multiple cloze tasks to mimic bundle interactions in conversations. Then in an online fine-tuning stage, Bunt agents are enhanced by user interactions. Our experiments on multiple offline datasets as well as the human evaluation show the value of extending MCR frameworks to bundle settings and the effectiveness of our Bunt design.","Tue, 26 Jul 2022 03:28:42 UTC (2,827 KB)"

Our proposed model, WhisperLite, uses contrastive learning to capture user intent from natural language text and improves the recommendation quality of fashion products. WhisperLite combines the strength of CLIP embeddings with additional neural network layers for personalization, and is trained using a composite loss function based on binary cross entropy and contrastive loss. The model demonstrates a significant improvement in offline recommendation retrieval metrics when tested on a real-world dataset collected from an online retail fashion store, as well as widely used open-source datasets in different e-commerce domains, such as restaurants, movies and TV shows, clothing and shoe reviews. We additionally conduct a user study that captures user judgements on the relevance of the model's recommended items, confirming the relevancy of WhisperLite's recommendations in an online setting.","Mon, 25 Jul 2022 10:15:56 UTC (1,603 KB)"

Here we investigate such a ``white shoe'' recognition problem from the perspective of tensor network (TN) machine learning and quantum entanglement. Utilizing a generative TN that captures the probability distribution of the features as quantum amplitudes, we propose an unsupervised recognition scheme of informative features with the variations of entanglement entropy (EE) caused by designed measurements. In this way, a given sample, where the values of its features are statistically meaningless, is mapped to the variations of EE that statistically characterize the gain of information. We show that the EE variations identify the features that are critical to recognize this specific sample, and the EE itself reveals the information distribution of the probabilities represented by the TN model. The signs of the variations further reveal the entanglement structures among the features. We test the validity of our scheme on a toy dataset of strip images, the MNIST dataset of hand-drawn digits, the fashion-MNIST dataset of the pictures of fashion articles, and the images of brain cells. Our scheme opens the avenue to the quantum-inspired and interpreted unsupervised learning, which can be applied to, e.g., image segmentation and object detection.","Wed, 13 Jul 2022 08:23:13 UTC (1,963 KB)[v2] Tue, 9 Aug 2022 00:38:17 UTC (3,887 KB)"

The bladder design of the Smart Shoe is upgraded to include a pressure supply and greater output flow capabilities. A bench top setup is created to rigorously test this new type of actuator. The bandwidth and stiffness capability of this new actuator are evaluated relative to forces and displacements encountered during human gait. Four force vs. displacement profiles relevant to haptic terrain display are proposed and tested using sliding-mode tracking control. It was found that the actuator could sustain a stiffness similar to a soft-soled shoe on concrete, as well as other terrain (sand, dirt, etc.), while the bandwidth of 7.3 Hz fell short of the goal bandwidth of 10 Hz. Compressions of the bladder done at 20 mm/s, which is similar to the speed of human gait, showed promising results in tracking a desired force trajectory. The results in this paper show this actuator is capable of displaying haptic terrain trajectories, providing a basis for futurep wearable haptic terrain display devices.","Tue, 12 Jul 2022 13:58:19 UTC (4,191 KB)"

For example, when users search for ``running'' in e-commerce, they would like to find products highly related to running, such as ``running shoes'' rather than ``shoes''. Nevertheless, many existing CSK collections rank statements solely by confidence scores, and there is no information about which ones are salient from a human perspective. In this work, we define the task of supervised salience evaluation, where given a CSK triple, the model is required to learn whether the triple is salient or not. In addition to formulating the new task, we also release a new Benchmark dataset of Salience Evaluation in E-commerce (BSEE) and hope to promote related research on commonsense knowledge salience evaluation. We conduct experiments in the dataset with several representative baseline models. The experimental results show that salience evaluation is a challenging task where models perform poorly on our evaluation set.

However, parametrizing a renderer to synthesize realistic images of a given product remains a challenging task that requires expert knowledge. While recent work has introduced neural rendering methods for virtual try-on from example images, current approaches are based on large generative models that cannot be used in real-time on mobile devices. This calls for a hybrid method that combines the advantages of computer graphics and neural rendering approaches. In this paper we propose a novel framework based on deep learning to build a real-time inverse graphics encoder that learns to map a single example image into the parameter space of a given augmented reality rendering engine. Our method leverages self-supervised learning and does not require labeled training data which makes it extendable to many virtual try-on applications. Furthermore, most augmented reality renderers are not differentiable in practice due to algorithmic choices or implementation constraints to reach real-time on portable devices. To relax the need for a graphics-based differentiable renderer in inverse graphics problems, we introduce a trainable imitator module. Our imitator is a generative network that learns to accurately reproduce the behavior of a given non-differentiable renderer. We propose a novel rendering sensitivity loss to train the imitator, which ensures that the network learns an accurate and continuous representation for each rendering parameter. Our framework enables novel applications where consumers can virtually try-on a novel unknown product from an inspirational reference image on social media. It can also be used by graphics artists to automatically create realistic rendering from a reference product image.","Thu, 12 May 2022 18:44:00 UTC (41,022 KB)"

Fowlkes","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Shoe tread impressions are one of the most common types of evidence left at crime scenes. However, the utility of such evidence is limited by the lack of databases of footwear prints that cover the large and growing number of distinct shoe models. Moreover, the database is preferred to contain the 3D shape, or depth, of shoe-tread photos so as to allow for extracting shoeprints to match a query (crime-scene) print. We propose to address this gap by leveraging shoe-tread photos collected by online retailers. The core challenge is to predict depth maps for these photos. As they do not have ground-truth 3D shapes allowing for training depth predictors, we exploit synthetic data that does. We develop a method termed ShoeRinsics that learns to predict depth by leveraging a mix of fully supervised synthetic data and unsupervised retail image data. In particular, we find domain adaptation and intrinsic image decomposition techniques effectively mitigate the synthetic-real domain gap and yield significantly better depth prediction. To validate our method, we introduce 2 validation sets consisting of shoe-tread image and print pairs and define a benchmarking protocol to quantify the quality of predicted depth. On this benchmark, ShoeRinsics outperforms existing methods of depth prediction and synthetic-to-real domain adaptation.","Wed, 4 May 2022 23:42:55 UTC (5,402 KB)[v2] Thu, 20 Oct 2022 10:35:29 UTC (10,618 KB)"

For example, a target product image is searched using a reference product image along with text about changing certain attributes of the reference image as the query. It is a more challenging image retrieval task that requires both semantic space learning and cross-modal fusion. Previous approaches that attempt to deal with both aspects achieve unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we decompose the CTI-IR task into a three-stage learning problem to progressively learn the complex knowledge for image retrieval with hybrid-modality queries. We first leverage the semantic embedding space for open-domain image-text retrieval, and then transfer the learned knowledge to the fashion-domain with fashion-related pre-training tasks. Finally, we enhance the pre-trained model from single-query to hybrid-modality query for the CTI-IR task. Furthermore, as the contribution of individual modality in the hybrid-modality query varies for different retrieval scenarios, we propose a self-supervised adaptive weighting strategy to dynamically determine the importance of image and text in the hybrid-modality query for better retrieval.

In this paper, we seek to temporally localize object states (e.g. ""empty"" and ""full"" cup) together with the corresponding state-modifying actions (""pouring coffee"") in long uncurated videos with minimal supervision. The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we develop a self-supervised model for jointly learning state-modifying actions together with the corresponding object states from an uncurated set of videos from the Internet. The model is self-supervised by the causal ordering signal, i.e. initial object state $\rightarrow$ manipulating action $\rightarrow$ end state. Second, to cope with noisy uncurated training data, our model incorporates a noise adaptive weighting module supervised by a small number of annotated still images, that allows to efficiently filter out irrelevant videos during training. Third, we collect a new dataset with more than 2600 hours of video and 34 thousand changes of object states, and manually annotate a part of this data to validate our approach.

At the same time, we also know very little about how these technologies perform on the diverse features, characteristics, and skin tones of India's 1.34 billion-plus population. In this paper, we test the face detection and facial analysis functions of four commercial facial processing tools on a dataset of Indian faces. The tools display varying error rates in the face detection and gender and age classification functions. The gender classification error rate for Indian female faces is consistently higher compared to that of males -- the highest female error rate being 14.68%. In some cases, this error rate is much higher than that shown by previous studies for females of other nationalities. Age classification errors are also high. Despite taking into account an acceptable error margin of plus or minus 10 years from a person's actual age, age prediction failures are in the range of 14.3% to 42.2%.

Existing work based on RAs however failed to reconcile the goal for fine-grained translation and the goal for high-quality generation. We propose a new model TRIP to coordinate these two goals for high-quality fine-grained translation. In particular, we simultaneously train two modules: a generator that translates an input image to the desired image with smooth subtle changes with respect to the interested attributes; and a ranker that ranks rival preferences consisting of the input image and the desired image. Rival preferences refer to the adversarial ranking process: (1) the ranker thinks no difference between the desired image and the input image in terms of the desired attributes; (2) the generator fools the ranker to believe that the desired image changes the attributes over the input image as desired. RAs over pairs of real images are introduced to guide the ranker to rank image pairs regarding the interested attributes only. With an effective ranker, the generator would ""win"" the adversarial game by producing high-quality images that present desired changes over the attributes compared to the input image. The experiments on two face image datasets and one shoe image dataset demonstrate that our TRIP achieves state-of-art results in generating high-fidelity images which exhibit smooth changes over the interested attributes.","Fri, 26 Nov 2021 10:30:55 UTC (11,560 KB)"

We also show that there are two distinctive pathways to produce homogeneous mixing in microchannels induced by the inhomogeneity of the boundary conditions. It can be achieved either by: 1) introducing stretching, folding and twisting of fluid volumes, i.e., via a horse-shoe type transformation map, or 2) by creating chaotic advection, through manipulation of the hydrophobic boundary patterns on the floor of the channels.

Rubinstein, Nicholas X. Fang","Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)","Elastomeric materials when sliding on clean and rough surfaces generate wrinkles at the interface due to tangential stress gradients. These interfacial folds travel along the bottom of elastomer as surface detachment waves to facilitate the apparent sliding motion of elastomer. At very low sliding speed compared to elastic surface waves, the process is dominated by surface adhesion and relaxation effects, and the phenomenon is historically referred to as Schallamach waves. We report in this letter the observation of fast-traveling intersonic detachment waves exceeding the Rayleigh and shear wave velocities of the soft material in contact. The spatio-temporal analysis revealed the accelerating nature of the detachment wave, and the scaling of wave speed with the elastic modului of the material suggests that this process is governed by elasticity and inertia. Multiple wave signatures on the plot were connected to different stages of surface wrinkles, as they exhibited distinctive slopes (from which velocities were derived) in the generation, propagation and rebound phases. We also characterized the frequencies of wrinkle generation in addition to the speeds and found a consistent scaling law of these two wave characteristics as the stiffness of elastomer increased. Physical implications of this new finding may further promote our understanding of elastomer noise generation mechanisms, as at macroscopic sliding velocity, the frequency of elastomer instability readily enters human audible ranges and interacts with other vibratory frequencies to cooperatively create harsh and detrimental noises in disc braking, wiper blade and shoe squeaking among many other elastomer applications.","Tue, 26 Oct 2021 05:57:29 UTC (2,844 KB)"

Then we developed a benchmark model and a competition model. We found that high reputation sellers and low reputation sellers adapt different pricing strategy depending on the informativeness of buyers and the competition among sellers. With a large proportion of informed buyers, high reputation sellers may charge lower price than low reputation sellers, which exists a negative price premium effect, in contrast to conclusions of some previous studies. Empirical findings were in consistence with our theoretical models. We collected data of five categories of products, televisions, laptops, cosmetics, shoes, and beverages, from Taobao, a leading C2C Chinese online market.

The proposed method utilizes clinical features extracted from the vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF), measured by 16 wearable sensors placed in the soles of subjects' shoes and learns interpretable fuzzy rules. Therefore, experts can verify the decision made by the proposed method based on investigating the firing strength of interpretable fuzzy rules. Moreover, experts can utilize the extracted fuzzy rules for patient diagnosing or adjust them based on their knowledge. To improve the robustness of the proposed method against uncertainty and noisy sensor measurements, Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic is applied. To learn fuzzy rules, two paradigms are proposed: 1- A batch learning approach based on clustering available samples is applied to extract initial fuzzy rules, 2- A complementary online learning is proposed to improve the rule base encountering new labeled samples.

"68","The Functional Correspondence Problem","Zihang Lai, Senthil Purushwalkam, Abhinav Gupta","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","The ability to find correspondences in visual data is the essence of most computer vision tasks. But what are the right correspondences? The task of visual correspondence is well defined for two different images of same object instance. In case of two images of objects belonging to same category, visual correspondence is reasonably well-defined in most cases. But what about correspondence between two objects of completely different category -- e.g., a shoe and a bottle? Does there exist any correspondence? Inspired by humans' ability to: (a) generalize beyond semantic categories and; (b) infer functional affordances, we introduce the problem of functional correspondences in this paper. Given images of two objects, we ask a simple question: what is the set of correspondences between these two images for a given task? For example, what are the correspondences between a bottle and shoe for the task of pounding or the task of pouring. We introduce a new dataset: FunKPoint that has ground truth correspondences for 10 tasks and 20 object categories. We also introduce a modular task-driven representation for attacking this problem and demonstrate that our learned representation is effective for this task. But most importantly, because our supervision signal is not bound by semantics, we show that our learned representation can generalize better on few-shot classification problem. We hope this paper will inspire our community to think beyond semantics and focus more on cross-category generalization and learning representations for robotics tasks.","Thu, 2 Sep 2021 17:18:06 UTC (873 KB)"

Specifically, ARShoe adopts a novel multi-branch network to realize pose estimation and segmentation simultaneously. A solution to generate realistic 3D shoe model occlusion during the try-on process is presented. To achieve a smooth and stable try-on effect, this work further develop a novel stabilization method. Moreover, for training and evaluation, we construct the very first large-scale foot benchmark with multiple virtual shoe try-on task-related labels annotated. Exhaustive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate the satisfying performance of ARShoe. Practical tests on common smartphones validate the real-time performance and stabilization of the proposed approach.","Tue, 24 Aug 2021 03:54:45 UTC (9,550 KB)"

Through these vlogs developers share a rich perspective of their technical work as well their personal lives. However, does the type of activities portrayed in vlogs differ from activities developers in the industry perform? Would developers at a software company prefer to show activities to different extents if they were asked to share about their day through vlogs? To answer these questions, we analyzed 130 vlogs by software developers on YouTube and conducted a survey with 335 software developers at a large software company. We found that although vlogs present traditional development activities such as coding and code peripheral activities (11%), they also prominently feature wellness and lifestyle related activities (47.3%) that have not been reflected in previous software engineering literature. We also found that developers at the software company were inclined to share more non-coding tasks (e.g., personal projects, time spent with family and friends, and health) when asked to create a mock-up vlog to promote diversity. These findings demonstrate a shift in our understanding of how software developers are spending their time and find valuable to share publicly. We discuss how vlogs provide a more complete perspective of software development work and serve as a valuable source of data for empirical research.","Wed, 14 Jul 2021 22:16:53 UTC (764 KB)[v2] Tue, 27 Jul 2021 16:56:46 UTC (1,534 KB)"
"71","Measurements of the Hubble Constant: Tensions in Perspective","Wendy L. Freedman","Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)","Measurement of the distances to nearby galaxies have improved rapidly in recent decades. The ever-present challenge is to reduce systematic effects, especially as greater distances are probed, and the uncertainties become larger. In this paper, we combine several recent calibrations of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method. These calibrations are internally self-consistent at the 1% level. New Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) data provide an additional consistency check, at a (lower) 5% level of accuracy, a result of the well-documented Gaia angular covariance bias. The updated TRGB calibration applied to a distant sample of Type Ia supernovae from the Carnegie Supernova Project results in a value of the Hubble constant of Ho = 69.8 $\pm$ 0.6 (stat) $\pm$ 1.6 (sys) km/s/Mpc. No statistically significant difference is found between the value of Ho based on the TRGB and that determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background. The TRGB results are also consistent to within 2$\sigma$ with the SHoES and Spitzer plus HST Key Project Cepheid calibrations. The TRGB results alone do not demand additional new physics beyond the standard Lambda-CDM cosmological model. They have the advantage of simplicity of the underlying physics (the core He flash) and small systematic uncertainties (from extinction, metallicity and crowding). Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of both the TRGB and Cepheids are reviewed, and prospects for addressing the current discrepancy with future Gaia, HST and JWST observations are discussed. Resolving this discrepancy is essential for ascertaining if the claimed tension in Ho between the locally-measured and the CMB-inferred value is physically motivated.","Tue, 29 Jun 2021 18:09:57 UTC (3,450 KB)"

The parametrization is generalized enough to include the contribution of spatial curvature and to capture the higher redshift behaviors. With this parameterization, we study the late time cosmic behavior and put constraints on the cosmological parameters like present values of Hubble parameter ($H_{0}$), matter energy density parameter ($\Omega_{m0}$), spatial curvature energy density parameter ($\Omega_{k0}$) and baryonic matter energy density parameter ($\Omega_{b0}$) using different combinations data like CMB (Cosmic microwave background), BAO (baryon acoustic oscillation), and SN (Pantheon sample for type Ia supernovae). We also rigorously study the Hubble tension in the framework of late time modification from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We find that the late time modification of the cosmic expansion can solve the Hubble tension between CMB $\&$ SHOES (local distance ladder observation for $H_{0}$), between CMB+BAO $\&$ SHOES and between CMB+SN $\&$ SHOES, but the late time modification can not solve the Hubble tension between CMB+BAO+SN and SHOES. That means CMB, BAO, and SN data combined put strong enough constraints on $H_{0}$ (even with varying $\Omega_{k0}$) and on other background cosmological parameters so that the addition of $H_{0}$ prior from SHOES (or from similar other local distance observations) can not significantly pull the $H_{0}$ value towards the corresponding SHOES value.","Sat, 5 Jun 2021 21:07:40 UTC (1,664 KB)[v2] Mon, 7 Feb 2022 19:57:09 UTC (2,448 KB)"

Machine learning systems, on the other hand, usually leverage spurious correlations in the training data, and while such correlations can help recognize objects in context, they hurt generalization. To be able to deal with underspecified datasets while still leveraging contextual clues during classification, we propose ProtoProp, a novel prototype propagation graph method. First we learn prototypical representations of objects (e.g., zebra) that are conditionally independent w.r.t. their attribute labels (e.g., stripes) and vice versa. Next we propagate the independent prototypes through a compositional graph, to learn compositional prototypes of novel attribute-object combinations that reflect the dependencies of the target distribution. The method does not rely on any external data, such as class hierarchy graphs or pretrained word embeddings. We evaluate our approach on AO-Clever, a synthetic and strongly visual dataset with clean labels, and UT-Zappos, a noisy real-world dataset of fine-grained shoe types.

Different measurements of the Hubble constant provide significantly different values, and this is known as the Hubble tension.

We apply the Bayesian tools and the Extreme Value theory dependent statistic to address the above issues. These techniques have been applied to the Panstarrs1 type Ia supernovae data. Our analysis for Hubble constant does not reject the Hubble tension. However, our value is smaller than that of the SHoES program and agrees with the CCHP value.

To address this problem, we introduce a novel method by adapting the Simpson's Diversity Index from biology, which enables a more effective and efficient quadratic search result diversification algorithm. We also extend the method to balance the diversity between multiple aspects through weighted factors and further improve computational complexity by developing a fast approximation algorithm.

We consider ensembles of random generators of $N$-dimensional Markovian evolution, quantum and classical ones, and evaluate their universal spectral properties. We then show how the two types of generators can be related by superdecoherence. In analogy with the mechanism of decoherence, which transforms a quantum state into a classical one, superdecoherence can be used to transform a Lindblad operator (generator of quantum evolution) into a Kolmogorov operator (generator of classical evolution). We inspect spectra of random Lindblad operators undergoing superdecoherence and demonstrate that, in the limit of complete superdecoherence, the resulting operators exhibit spectral density typical to random Kolmogorov operators. By gradually increasing strength of superdecoherence, we observe a sharp quantum-to-classical transition. Furthermore, we define an inverse procedure of supercoherification that is a generalization of the scheme used to construct a quantum state out of a classical one. Finally, we study microscopic correlation between neighbouring eigenvalues through the complex spacing ratios and observe the horse-shoe distribution, emblematic of the Ginibre universality class, for both types of random generators. Remarkably, it survives superdecoherence and supercoherification.","Wed, 5 May 2021 23:35:47 UTC (5,423 KB)[v2] Tue, 8 Jun 2021 11:50:48 UTC (6,540 KB)"

Chirikjian","Robotics (cs.RO)","To function autonomously in the physical world, humanoid robots need high-fidelity sensing systems, especially for forces that cannot be easily modeled. Modeling forces in robot feet is particularly challenging due to static indeterminacy, thereby requiring direct sensing. Unfortunately, resolving forces in the feet of some smaller-sized humanoids is limited both by the quality of sensors and the current algorithms used to interpret the data. This paper presents light-weight, low-cost and open-source force-sensing shoes to improve force measurement for popular smaller-sized humanoid robots, and a method for calibrating the shoes. The shoes measure center of pressure (CoP) and normal ground reaction force (GRF). The calibration method enables each individual shoe to reach high measurement precision by applying known forces at different locations of the shoe and using a regularized least squares optimization to interpret sensor outputs. A NAO robot is used as our experimental platform. Experiments are conducted to compare the measurement performance between the shoes and the robot's factory-installed force-sensing resistors (FSRs), and to evaluate the calibration method over these two sensing modules. Experimental results show that the shoes significantly improve CoP and GRF measurement precision compared to the robot's built-in FSRs. Moreover, the developed calibration method improves the measurement performance for both our shoes and the built-in FSRs.","Wed, 14 Apr 2021 04:11:17 UTC (3,796 KB)"

Methods: The algorithm makes novel use of a Lie-group-based extended Kalman filter. The algorithm iterates through the prediction (kinematic equation), measurement (pelvis position pseudo-measurements, zero-velocity update, and flat-floor assumption), and constraint update (hinged knee and ankle joints, constant leg lengths). Results: The inertial motion capture algorithm was extensively evaluated on two datasets showing its performance against two standard benchmark approaches in optical motion capture (i.e., plug-in gait (commonly used in gait analysis) and a kinematic fit (commonly used in animation, robotics, and musculoskeleton simulation)), giving insight into the similarity and differences between the said approaches used in different application areas. The overall mean body segment position (relative to mid-pelvis origin) and orientation error magnitude of our algorithm ($n=14$ participants) for free walking was $5.93 \pm 1.33$ cm and $13.43 \pm 1.89^\circ$ when using three IMUs placed on the feet and pelvis, and $6.35 \pm 1.20$ cm and $12.71 \pm 1.60^\circ$ when using only two IMUs placed on the feet. Conclusion: The algorithm was able to track the joint angles in the sagittal plane for straight walking well, but requires improvement for unscripted movements (e.g., turning around, side steps), especially for dynamic movements or when considering clinical applications.

We show our model to be applicable to a large variety of garments including T-shirts, hoodies, jackets, shorts, pants, skirts, shoes and even hair. The representation flexibility of SMPLicit builds upon an implicit model conditioned with the SMPL human body parameters and a learnable latent space which is semantically interpretable and aligned with the clothing attributes. The proposed model is fully differentiable, allowing for its use into larger end-to-end trainable systems.

Despite having superior performance, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks. Therefore in this paper, we developed eight Android malware detection models based on machine learning and deep neural network and investigated their robustness against adversarial attacks. For this purpose, we created new variants of malware using Reinforcement Learning, which will be misclassified as benign by the existing Android malware detection models. We propose two novel attack strategies, namely single policy attack and multiple policy attack using reinforcement learning for white-box and grey-box scenario respectively. Putting ourselves in the adversary's shoes, we designed adversarial attacks on the detection models with the goal of maximizing fooling rate, while making minimum modifications to the Android application and ensuring that the app's functionality and behavior do not change. We achieved an average fooling rate of 44.21% and 53.20% across all the eight detection models with a maximum of five modifications using a single policy attack and multiple policy attack, respectively. The highest fooling rate of 86.09% with five changes was attained against the decision tree-based model using the multiple policy approach. Finally, we propose an adversarial defense strategy that reduces the average fooling rate by threefold to 15.22% against a single policy attack, thereby increasing the robustness of the detection models i.e. the proposed model can effectively detect variants (metamorphic) of malware. The experimental analysis shows that our proposed Android malware detection system using reinforcement learning is more robust against adversarial attacks.","Wed, 27 Jan 2021 16:45:57 UTC (875 KB)"

First, even though general MG models evolve differently (i.e., background and perturbations) to the standard cosmological model, it is usual to assume a $\Lambda$CDM background. This treatment is not correct and in the era of precision cosmology could induce undesired biases in cosmological parameters. Second, neutrino mass is usually held fixed in the analyses which could obscure its relation to MG parameters. In a couple of previous papers we showed that by using the Effective Fluid Approach we can accurately compute observables in fairly general MG models. An appealing advantage of our approach is that it allows a pretty easy implementation of this kinds of models in Boltzmann solvers (i.e., less error--prone) while having a useful analytical description of the effective fluid to understand the underlying physics. This paper illustrates how an effective fluid approach can be used to carry out proper analyses of cosmological constraints in MG models. We investigated three MG models including the sum of neutrino masses as a varying parameter in our Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses. Two models (i.e., Designer $f(R)$ [DES-fR] and Designer Horndeski [HDES]) have a background matching $\Lambda$CDM, while in a third model (i.e., Hu $\&$ Sawicki $f(R)$ model [HS]) the background differs from the standard model. In this way we estimate how relevant the background is when constraining MG parameters along with neutrinos' masses. We implement the models in the popular Boltzmann solver CLASS and use recent, available data (i.e., Planck 2018, CMB lensing, BAO, SNIa Pantheon compilation, $H_0$ from SHOES, and RSD Gold-18 compilation) to compute tight cosmological constraints in the MG parameters that account for deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model.

This is true for laboratory measurements on powders of natural materials as well as remote observations of Solar System surfaces. Here, we measured the dependences of reflectance spectra with phase angles, of a suite of 72 meteorites in the 400-2600 nm range. The 10-30° phase angle range is investigated in order to study the contribution of Shadow Hiding Opposition Effect to the phase behavior. The behavior is then extrapolated to phase angle of 0° using a polynomial fit, in order to provide grounds for comparison across meteorite groups (enabling to remove the contribution of shadows to reflectance) as well as to provide equivalent albedo values that should be comparable to geometric albedo values derived for small bodies. We find a general behavior of increasing strength of the SHOE with lower reflectance values (whether between samples or for a given samples with absorption features). This trend provides a first order way to correct any reflectance spectra of meteorite powders measured under standard conditions (g=30) from the contribution of shadows. The g=0 degre calculated reflectance and equivalent albedos are then compared to typical values of albedos for main-belt asteroids. This reveals that among carbonaceous chondrites only Tagish Lake group, CI, and CM chondrites have equivalent albedo compatible with C- and D-type asteroids. On the other hand equivalent albedo derived with CO, CR and CK chondrites are compatible with L- and K-type asteroids. The equivalent albedo derived for ordinary chondrites is related to petrographic types, with low-grade petrographic type (type 3.6 and less) being generally darker that higher petrographic types. This works provides a framework for further understanding of the asteroids meteorite linkage when combining with colors and spectroscopy.","Tue, 22 Sep 2020 12:36:29 UTC (699 KB)"

Although new, these apps are being used practically for scanning feet with an aim to providing accurate information about various properties of the human foot. With the availability of many 'foot scanning and measuring apps' in the app stores, the need for an evaluation system for such apps can be deemed necessary as little information regarding the evidence-based quality of these apps is available. To characterize the assessment of measurement techniques and essential software quality characteristics of mobile foot measuring apps, and determine their effectiveness for potential use as commercial professional tools for foot care health professionals such as pedorthists, podiatrists, orthotists and so on, to assist in measuring foot for custom shoes, and for individuals to enhance the awareness of foot health and hygiene and prevention of foot-related problems. An electronic search across Android and iOS app stores was conducted between July 2020 and August 2020 for apps related to foot measurement. Mobile apps with stated goals of foot measurement and general foot health were identified and selected by three independent raters and discrepancies regarding the selected apps were resolved via a fourth rater. Evaluation inferences found all apps failing to meet even half of the measurement-specific criteria required for the proper manufacturing of custom-made footwear. 23% (6/26) of apps were found to utilize either external scanners or advanced algorithms to reconstruct 3D models of user foot that can possibly be used for ordering custom-made footwear and medical casts for fitting irregular foot sizes and shapes. Overall, current apps for foot measurement do not follow any specific guidelines for measurement purposes.","Wed, 9 Sep 2020 10:32:34 UTC (478 KB)"

Kia","Signal Processing (eess.SP)","This paper investigates an infra-structure free global localization of a group of communicating mobile agents (e.g., first responders or exploring robots) via an ultra-wideband (UWB) inter-agent ranging aided dead-reckoning. We propose a loosely coupled cooperative localization algorithm that acts as an augmentation atop the local dead-reckoning system of each mobile agent. This augmentation becomes active only when an agent wants to process a relative measurement it has taken. The main contribution of this paper is addressing the challenges in the proper processing of the UWB range measurements in the framework of a loosely coupled cooperative localization. Even though UWB offers a decimeter level accuracy in line-of-sight (LoS) ranging, its accuracy degrades significantly in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) due to the significant unknown positive bias in the measurements. Thus, the measurement models for the UWB LoS and NLoS ranging conditions are different, and proper processing of NLoS measurements requires a bias compensation measure. We also show that, in practice, the measurement modal discriminators determine the type of UWB range measurements should be probabilistic. To take into account the probabilistic nature of the NLoS identifiers when processing UWB inter-agent ranging feedback, we employ an interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator in our localization filter. We also propose a bias compensation method for NLoS UWB measurements. The effectiveness of our cooperative localization is demonstrated via an experiment for a group of pedestrians who use UWB relative range measurements among themselves to improve their shoe-mounted INS geolocation.","Tue, 8 Sep 2020 06:17:12 UTC (6,061 KB)[v2] Fri, 11 Sep 2020 04:42:46 UTC (6,062 KB)[v3] Wed, 30 Dec 2020 19:26:34 UTC (6,637 KB)"

Incorporating user feedback, via multi-modal inputs, to navigate visual search can help tailor retrieved results to specific user queries. We focus on the task of text-conditioned image retrieval that utilizes support text feedback alongside a reference image to retrieve images that concurrently satisfy constraints imposed by both inputs. The task is challenging since it requires learning composite image-text features by incorporating multiple cross-granular semantic edits from text feedback and then applying the same to visual features. To address this, we propose a novel framework SAC which resolves the above in two major steps: ""where to see"" (Semantic Feature Attention) and ""how to change"" (Semantic Feature Modification). We systematically show how our architecture streamlines the generation of text-aware image features by removing the need for various modules required by other state-of-art techniques.

Online retailers, from leading companies to start-ups, can leverage such applications in order to increase profit margin and enhance the consumer experience. Many notable schemes have been proposed to classify fashion items, however, the majority of which focused upon classifying basic-level categories, such as T-shirts, pants, skirts, shoes, bags, and so forth. In contrast to most prior efforts, this paper aims to enable an in-depth classification of fashion item attributes within the same category. Beginning with a single dress, we seek to classify the type of dress hem, the hem length, and the sleeve length. The proposed scheme is comprised of three major stages: (a) localization of a target item from an input image using semantic segmentation, (b) detection of human key points (e.g., point of shoulder) using a pre-trained CNN and a bounding box, and (c) three phases to classify the attributes using a combination of algorithmic approaches and deep neural networks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is highly effective, with all categories having average precision of above 93.02%, and outperforms existing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)-based schemes.","Thu, 27 Aug 2020 19:44:43 UTC (1,232 KB)"

This compositional generalization capacity is critical for learning in real-world domains like vision and language because the long tail of new combinations dominates the distribution. Unfortunately, learning systems struggle with compositional generalization because they often build on features that are correlated with class labels even if they are not ""essential"" for the class. This leads to consistent misclassification of samples from a new distribution, like new combinations of known components. Here we describe an approach for compositional generalization that builds on causal ideas. First, we describe compositional zero-shot learning from a causal perspective, and propose to view zero-shot inference as finding ""which intervention caused the image?"". Second, we present a causal-inspired embedding model that learns disentangled representations of elementary components of visual objects from correlated (confounded) training data. We evaluate this approach on two datasets for predicting new combinations of attribute-object pairs: A well-controlled synthesized images dataset and a real-world dataset which consists of fine-grained types of shoes.

As the $\rm{eV}$ sterile states naturally become non-relativistic before the Matter Radiation Equality (MRE), we show that the neutrino-scalar fluid develops strong perturbative instability followed by the formation of neutrino-nuggets and the early dark energy behaviour disappears around MRE. The stability of the nugget is achieved when the Fermi pressure balances the attractive scalar force and we numerically find the mass and radius of heavy cold nuggets by solving for the static configuration for the scalar field. We find that for the case when DM nugget density is sub-dominant and most of the early DE energy goes into scalar field dynamics, it can in principle relax the Hubble anomaly. Especially when a kinetic energy dominated phase appears after the phase transition, the DE density dilutes faster than radiation and satisfy the requirements for solving $H_0$ anomaly. In our scenario, unlike in originally proposed early dark energy theory, the dark energy density is controlled by ($\rm{eV}$) neutrino mass and it does not require a fine tuned EDE scale. We perform a MCMC analysis and confront our model with Planck + SHOES and BAO data and find an evidence for non-zero neutrino-scalar EDE density during MRE.

Existing ReID methods rely on images or videos collected using RGB cameras.

In this paper, we introduce RF-ReID, a novel approach that harnesses radio frequency (RF) signals for longterm person ReID. RF signals traverse clothes and reflect off the human body; thus they can be used to extract more persistent human-identifying features like body size and shape. We evaluate the performance of RF-ReID on longitudinal datasets that span days and weeks, where the person may wear different clothes across days. Our experiments demonstrate that RF-ReID outperforms state-of-the-art RGB-based ReID approaches for long term person ReID. Our results also reveal two interesting features: First since RF signals work in the presence of occlusions and poor lighting, RF-ReID allows for person ReID in such scenarios. Second, unlike photos and videos which reveal personal and private information, RF signals are more privacy-preserving, and hence can help extend person ReID to privacy-concerned domains, like healthcare.","Thu, 2 Apr 2020 15:50:42 UTC (7,285 KB)"

In this paper, we propose a novel fashion collocation framework, Neural Graph Filtering, that models a flexible set of fashion items via a graph neural network. Specifically, we consider the visual embeddings of each garment as a node in the graph, and describe the inter-garment relationship as the edge between nodes. By applying symmetric operations on the edge vectors, this framework allows varying numbers of inputs/outputs and is invariant to their ordering. We further include a style classifier augmented with focal loss to enable the collocation of significantly diverse styles, which are inherently imbalanced in the training set. To facilitate a comprehensive study on diverse fashion collocation, we reorganize Amazon Fashion dataset with carefully designed evaluation protocols. We evaluate the proposed approach on three popular benchmarks, the Polyvore dataset, the Polyvore-D dataset, and our reorganized Amazon Fashion dataset.

In this paper, we aim at solving the fashion compatibility problem given specific themes. To this end, we built the first real-world theme-aware fashion dataset comprising 14K around outfits labeled with 32 themes. In this dataset, there are more than 40K fashion items labeled with 152 fine-grained categories. We also propose an attention model learning fashion compatibility given a specific theme. It starts with a category-specific subspace learning, which projects compatible outfit items in certain categories to be close in the subspace. Thanks to strong connections between fashion themes and categories, we then build a theme-attention model over the category-specific embedding space. This model associates themes with the pairwise compatibility with attention, and thus compute the outfit-wise compatibility.

To learn such features, existing methods are focused on the striping-based approach that builds multi-branch neural networks to learn local features in each part of the identities, with one-branch network dedicated to one part. This results in complex models with a large number of parameters. To address this issue, this paper proposes to learn the multifaceted features in a simple unified single-branch neural network.

The loss structures the augmented images resulted by the two types of image erasing in a two-level hierarchy and enforces multifaceted attention to different parts.

Users' clicks can be considered as implicit feedback which indicates their preferences and used to re-rank subsequent SERPs. Relevance feedback (RF) techniques are usually involved to deal with such scenarios. However, these methods are designed for document retrieval, where relevance is the most important criterion. In contrast, product search engines need to retrieve items that are not only relevant but also satisfactory in terms of customers' preferences. Personalization based on users' purchase history has been shown to be effective in product search. However, this method captures users' long-term interest, which does not always align with their short-term interest, and does not benefit customers with little or no purchase history.

We also propose an end-to-end context-aware embedding model which can capture both types of context. Our experimental results show that short-term context leads to much better performance compared with long-term and no context. Moreover, our proposed model is more effective than state-of-art word-based RF models.","Mon, 9 Sep 2019 19:00:49 UTC (274 KB)[v2] Thu, 9 Jan 2020 18:26:28 UTC (274 KB)"

Rich, Mark Seibert","Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)","We present a new and independent determination of the local value of the Hubble constant based on a calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) applied to Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). We find a value of Ho = 69.8 +/- 0.8 (+/-1.1\% stat) +/- 1.7 (+/-2.4\% sys) km/sec/Mpc. The TRGB method is both precise and accurate, and is parallel to, but independent of the Cepheid distance scale. Our value sits midway in the range defined by the current Hubble tension. It agrees at the 1.2-sigma level with that of the Planck 2018 estimate, and at the 1.7-sigma level with the SHoES measurement of Ho based on the Cepheid distance scale. The TRGB distances have been measured using deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) imaging of galaxy halos. The zero point of the TRGB calibration is set with a distance modulus to the Large Magellanic Cloud of 18.477 +/- 0.004 (stat) +/-0.020 (sys) mag, based on measurement of 20 late-type detached eclipsing binary (DEB) stars, combined with an HST parallax calibration of a 3.6 micron Cepheid Leavitt law based on Spitzer observations. We anchor the TRGB distances to galaxies that extend our measurement into the Hubble flow using the recently completed Carnegie Supernova Project I sample containing about 100 well-observed SNeIa. There are several advantages of halo TRGB distance measurements relative to Cepheid variables: these include low halo reddening, minimal effects of crowding or blending of the photometry, only a shallow (calibrated) sensitivity to metallicity in the I-band, and no need for multiple epochs of observations or concerns of different slopes with period. In addition, the host masses of our TRGB host-galaxy sample are higher on average than the Cepheid sample, better matching the range of host-galaxy masses in the CSP distant sample, and reducing potential systematic effects in the SNeIa measurements.","Fri, 12 Jul 2019 18:56:31 UTC (3,766 KB)"
"114","A Bayesian Hierarchical Model for Evaluating Forensic Footwear Evidence","Neil A. Spencer, Jared S. Murray","Applications (stat.AP)","When a latent shoeprint is discovered at a crime scene, forensic analysts inspect it for distinctive patterns of wear such as scratches and holes (known as accidentals) on the source shoe's sole. If its accidentals correspond to those of a suspect's shoe, the print can be used as forensic evidence to place the suspect at the crime scene. The strength of this evidence depends on the random match probability---the chance that a shoe chosen at random would match the crime scene print's accidentals. Evaluating random match probabilities requires an accurate model for the spatial distribution of accidentals on shoe soles. A recent report by the President's Council of Advisors in Science and Technology criticized existing models in the literature, calling for new empirically validated techniques. We respond to this request with a new spatial point process model for accidental locations, developed within a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We treat the tread pattern of each shoe as a covariate, allowing us to pool information across large heterogeneous databases of shoes. Existing models ignore this information; our results show that including it leads to significantly better model fit. We demonstrate this by fitting our model to one such database.","Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:57:13 UTC (5,685 KB)[v2] Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:27:08 UTC (2,920 KB)"

Furthermore, we demonstrate efficiency of our method empirically and theoretically, needing only O(n log(n)Delta^-2) queries in favorable settings, where Delta^-2 accounts for the effect of noise.

The ultraviolet imaging data of the galaxy disk reveal a region with reduced flux around the center of the galaxy and a horse shoe shaped region with enhanced flux in the outer disk. The characterization of the ionization regions based on emission line diagnostic diagrams shows that the region of reduced flux seen in the ultraviolet is within the AGN-dominated area. The CO J$_{2-1}$ map of the galaxy disk reveals a cavity in the central region. The image of the galaxy disk at redder wavelengths (9050-9250 $\overset{\lower.5em\circ}{\mathrm{A}}$) reveals the presence of a stellar bar. The star formation rate map of the galaxy disk shows that the star formation suppression in the cavity occurred in the last few 10$^8$ yr. We present several lines of evidence supporting the scenario that suppression of star formation in the central region of the disk is most likely due to the feedback from the AGN.

They open up new means of interaction and may provide an excellent opportunity to reach new customers and increase sales.

Existing manipulation pipelines typically specify the desired configuration as a target 6-DOF pose and rely on explicitly estimating the pose of the manipulated objects. However, representing an object with a parameterized transformation defined on a fixed template cannot capture large intra-category shape variation, and specifying a target pose at a category level can be physically infeasible or fail to accomplish the task -- e.g. knowing the pose and size of a coffee mug relative to some canonical mug is not sufficient to successfully hang it on a rack by its handle. Hence we propose a novel formulation of category-level manipulation that uses semantic 3D keypoints as the object representation. This keypoint representation enables a simple and interpretable specification of the manipulation target as geometric costs and constraints on the keypoints, which flexibly generalizes existing pose-based manipulation methods. Using this formulation, we factor the manipulation policy into instance segmentation, 3D keypoint detection, optimization-based robot action planning and local dense-geometry-based action execution. This factorization allows us to leverage advances in these sub-problems and combine them into a general and effective perception-to-action manipulation pipeline. Our pipeline is robust to large intra-category shape variation and topology changes as the keypoint representation ignores task-irrelevant geometric details. Extensive hardware experiments demonstrate our method can reliably accomplish tasks with never-before seen objects in a category, such as placing shoes and mugs with significant shape variation into category level target configurations.","Fri, 15 Mar 2019 17:31:00 UTC (9,109 KB)[v2] Tue, 29 Oct 2019 16:04:29 UTC (5,797 KB)"

Therefore, recent investigations turn to collect pairwise comparisons via crowdsourcing platforms. However, crowdsourcing data usually contains outliers. For this purpose, it is desired to develop a robust model for learning SVP from crowdsourced noisy annotations. In this paper, we construct a deep SVP prediction model which not only leads to better detection of annotation outliers but also enables learning with extremely sparse annotations. Specifically, we construct a comparison multi-graph based on the collected annotations, where different labeling results correspond to edges with different directions between two vertexes. Then, we propose a generalized deep probabilistic framework which consists of an SVP prediction module and an outlier modeling module that work collaboratively and are optimized jointly.

The ratio quantifies a Bayesian confidence in our ability to combine the datasets. This interpretation is prior-dependent, with wider prior widths boosting the confidence. We therefore propose that if there are any reasonable priors which reduce the confidence to below unity, then we cannot assert that the datasets are compatible. Computing the evidence ratios for the DES first year analysis and Planck, given that narrower priors drop the confidence to below unity, we conclude that DES and Planck are, in a Bayesian sense, incompatible under LCDM. Additionally we compute ratios which confirm the consensus that measurements of the acoustic scale by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (SDSS) are compatible with Planck, whilst direct measurements of the acceleration rate of the Universe by the SHOES collaboration are not. We propose a modification to the Bayes ratio which removes the prior dependency using Kullback-Leibler divergences, and using this statistical test find Planck in strong tension with SHOES, in moderate tension with DES, and in no tension with SDSS. We propose this statistic as the optimal way to compare datasets, ahead of the next DES data releases, as well as future surveys. Finally, as an element of these calculations, we introduce in a cosmological setting the Bayesian model dimensionality, which is a parameterisation-independent measure of the number of parameters that a given dataset constrains.","Mon, 11 Feb 2019 18:11:13 UTC (2,293 KB)[v2] Mon, 22 Jul 2019 07:07:24 UTC (2,309 KB)[v3] Fri, 2 Aug 2019 18:01:25 UTC (2,309 KB)[v4] Thu, 3 Oct 2019 11:41:53 UTC (2,309 KB)[v5] Sat, 23 Nov 2019 12:20:25 UTC (2,309 KB)"

In contrast to representing domain characteristics using different generators or domain codes, we pre-train a classification network to explicitly classify the domain of an image. After pre-training, this network is used to extract the domain-specific features of each image. Such features, together with the domain-independent features extracted by another encoder (shared across different domains), are used to generate image in target domain. Extensive experiments on multiple facial attribute translation, multiple identity translation, multiple season translation and conditional edges-to-shoes/handbags demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In addition, we can transfer the domain-specific feature extractor obtained on the Facescrub dataset with domain supervision information to unseen domains, such as faces in the CelebA dataset.

These filaments extend over 20-100kpc, they are tightly correlated with ionized gas (H$\alpha$, [NII]) emission, and have characteristic shapes: either radial and straight, or also showing a U-turn, like a horse-shoe structure. The kinematics is quite regular and laminar, and the derived infall time is much longer than the free-fall time. The filaments extend up to the radius where the cooling time becomes larger than the infall time. Filaments can be perturbed by the sloshing of the BCG in its cluster, and spectacular cooling wakes have been observed. Filaments tend to occur at the border of cavities driven in the X-ray gas by the AGN radio jets. Observations of cool core clusters support the thermal instability scenario, which accounts for the multiphase medium in the upper atmospheres of BCG, where the right balance between heating and cooling is reached, and a chaotic cold gas accretion occurs.

Since different activities accumulate energies in the capacitor at different rates, these activities can be detected directly by observing the charging rate of the capacitor. The key advantage of the proposed capacitor based activity sensing mechanism, called CapSense, is that it obviates the need for sampling the motion signal during the activity detection period thus significantly saving power consumption of the wearable device. A challenge we face is that capacitors are inherently non-linear energy accumulators, which, even for the same activity, leads to significant variations in charging rates at different times depending on the current charge level of the capacitor. We solve this problem by jointly configuring the parameters of the capacitor and the associated energy harvesting circuits, which allows us to operate on charging cycles that are approximately linear. We design and implement a kinetic-powered shoe sole and conduct experiments with 10 subjects. Our results show that CapSense can classify five different daily activities with 95% accuracy while consuming 73% less system power compared to conventional motion signal based activity detection.","Tue, 19 Jun 2018 06:00:46 UTC (3,120 KB)"

We use Variational Bayesian Inference to study the parameters of the model, and use their resulting posterior distributions to make inference on (a) the contributions of sites of interest to a dust mixture, and (b) the particle profiles associated with these sites.","Wed, 16 May 2018 19:30:04 UTC (2,673 KB)[v2] Thu, 24 May 2018 01:16:43 UTC (2,673 KB)[v3] Thu, 31 Jan 2019 22:43:57 UTC (14,782 KB)"

Existing approaches propose interactive image search as a promising venue. However, they either entrust the user with taking the initiative to provide informative feedback, or give all control to the system which determines informative questions to ask. Instead, we propose a mixed-initiative framework where both the user and system can be active participants, depending on whose initiative will be more beneficial for obtaining high-quality search results. We develop a reinforcement learning approach which dynamically decides which of three interaction opportunities to give to the user: drawing a sketch, providing free-form attribute feedback, or answering attribute-based questions. By allowing these three options, our system optimizes both the informativeness and exploration capabilities allowing faster image retrieval. We outperform three baselines on three datasets and extensive experimental settings.","Tue, 8 May 2018 16:13:24 UTC (6,286 KB)"
"136","Conditional Image-to-Image Translation","Jianxin Lin, Yingce Xia, Tao Qin, Zhibo Chen, Tie-Yan Liu","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Image-to-image translation tasks have been widely investigated with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and dual learning. However, existing models lack the ability to control the translated results in the target domain and their results usually lack of diversity in the sense that a fixed image usually leads to (almost) deterministic translation result. In this paper, we study a new problem, conditional image-to-image translation, which is to translate an image from the source domain to the target domain conditioned on a given image in the target domain. It requires that the generated image should inherit some domain-specific features of the conditional image from the target domain. Therefore, changing the conditional image in the target domain will lead to diverse translation results for a fixed input image from the source domain, and therefore the conditional input image helps to control the translation results. We tackle this problem with unpaired data based on GANs and dual learning. We twist two conditional translation models (one translation from A domain to B domain, and the other one from B domain to A domain) together for inputs combination and reconstruction while preserving domain independent features. We carry out experiments on men's faces from-to women's faces translation and edges to shoes&bags translations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.","Tue, 1 May 2018 09:23:07 UTC (2,250 KB)"
"137","A Variational U-Net for Conditional Appearance and Shape Generation","Patrick Esser, Ekaterina Sutter, Björn Ommer","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Deep generative models have demonstrated great performance in image synthesis. However, results deteriorate in case of spatial deformations, since they generate images of objects directly, rather than modeling the intricate interplay of their inherent shape and appearance. We present a conditional U-Net for shape-guided image generation, conditioned on the output of a variational autoencoder for appearance. The approach is trained end-to-end on images, without requiring samples of the same object with varying pose or appearance. Experiments show that the model enables conditional image generation and transfer. Therefore, either shape or appearance can be retained from a query image, while freely altering the other. Moreover, appearance can be sampled due to its stochastic latent representation, while preserving shape. In quantitative and qualitative experiments on COCO, DeepFashion, shoes, Market-1501 and handbags, the approach demonstrates significant improvements over the state-of-the-art.","Thu, 12 Apr 2018 19:05:57 UTC (7,643 KB)"

Fowlkes","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","We investigate the problem of automatically determining what type of shoe left an impression found at a crime scene. This recognition problem is made difficult by the variability in types of crime scene evidence (ranging from traces of dust or oil on hard surfaces to impressions made in soil) and the lack of comprehensive databases of shoe outsole tread patterns. We find that mid-level features extracted by pre-trained convolutional neural nets are surprisingly effective descriptors for this specialized domains. However, the choice of similarity measure for matching exemplars to a query image is essential to good performance. For matching multi-channel deep features, we propose the use of multi-channel normalized cross-correlation and analyze its effectiveness. Our proposed metric significantly improves performance in matching crime scene shoeprints to laboratory test impressions. We also show its effectiveness in other cross-domain image retrieval problems: matching facade images to segmentation labels and aerial photos to map images. Finally, we introduce a discriminatively trained variant and fine-tune our system through our proposed metric, obtaining state-of-the-art performance.","Fri, 6 Apr 2018 17:35:43 UTC (2,363 KB)[v2] Mon, 1 Oct 2018 04:16:17 UTC (2,818 KB)"

However, when humans compare images, certain differences will naturally stick out and come to mind first. These most noticeable differences, or prominent differences, are likely to be described first. In addition, many differences, although present, may not be mentioned at all. In this work, we introduce and model prominent differences, a rich new functionality for comparing images. We collect instance-level annotations of most noticeable differences, and build a model trained on relative attribute features that predicts prominent differences for unseen pairs. We test our model on the challenging UT-Zap50K shoes and LFW10 faces datasets, and outperform an array of baseline methods. We then demonstrate how our prominence model improves two vision tasks, image search and description generation, enabling more natural communication between people and vision systems.","Sat, 31 Mar 2018 03:20:18 UTC (4,804 KB)[v2] Fri, 13 Apr 2018 18:44:09 UTC (4,804 KB)"

Plummer, Krishna Dusad, Shreya Rajpal, Ranjitha Kumar, David Forsyth","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Outfits in online fashion data are composed of items of many different types (e.g. top, bottom, shoes) that share some stylistic relationship with one another. A representation for building outfits requires a method that can learn both notions of similarity (for example, when two tops are interchangeable) and compatibility (items of possibly different type that can go together in an outfit). This paper presents an approach to learning an image embedding that respects item type, and jointly learns notions of item similarity and compatibility in an end-to-end model. To evaluate the learned representation, we crawled 68,306 outfits created by users on the Polyvore website. Our approach obtains 3-5% improvement over the state-of-the-art on outfit compatibility prediction and fill-in-the-blank tasks using our dataset, as well as an established smaller dataset, while supporting a variety of useful queries.","Sun, 25 Mar 2018 02:50:58 UTC (7,834 KB)[v2] Fri, 27 Jul 2018 20:27:54 UTC (9,012 KB)"
"141","Adversarial Active Learning for Deep Networks: a Margin Based Approach","Melanie Ducoffe, Frederic Precioso","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","We propose a new active learning strategy designed for deep neural networks. The goal is to minimize the number of data annotation queried from an oracle during training. Previous active learning strategies scalable for deep networks were mostly based on uncertain sample selection. In this work, we focus on examples lying close to the decision boundary. Based on theoretical works on margin theory for active learning, we know that such examples may help to considerably decrease the number of annotations. While measuring the exact distance to the decision boundaries is intractable, we propose to rely on adversarial examples. We do not consider anymore them as a threat instead we exploit the information they provide on the distribution of the input space in order to approximate the distance to decision boundaries. We demonstrate empirically that adversarial active queries yield faster convergence of CNNs trained on MNIST, the Shoe-Bag and the Quick-Draw datasets.","Tue, 27 Feb 2018 12:02:33 UTC (183 KB)"
"142","Limits on the number of spacetime dimensions from GW170817","Kris Pardo, Maya Fishbach, Daniel E. Holz, David N. Spergel","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)","The observation of GW170817 in both gravitational and electromagnetic waves provides a number of unique tests of general relativity. One question we can answer with this event is: Do large-wavelength gravitational waves and short-frequency photons experience the same number of spacetime dimensions? In models that include additional non-compact spacetime dimensions, as the gravitational waves propagate, they ""leak"" into the extra dimensions, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of the observed gravitational waves, and a commensurate systematic error in the inferred distance to the gravitational wave source. Electromagnetic waves would remain unaffected. We compare the inferred distance to GW170817 from the observation of gravitational waves, $d_L^\mathrm{GW}$, with the inferred distance to the electromagnetic counterpart NGC 4993, $d_L^\mathrm{EM}$. We constrain $d_L^\mathrm{GW} = (d_L^\mathrm{EM}/\mathrm{Mpc})^\mathrm{\gamma}$ with $\gamma = 1.01^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$ (for the SHoES value of $H_0$) or $\gamma = 0.99^{+0.03}_{-0.05}$ (for the Planck value of $H_0$), where all values are MAP and minimal 68% credible intervals. These constraints imply that gravitational waves propagate in $D=3+1$ spacetime dimensions, as expected in general relativity. In particular, we find that $D = 4.02^{+0.07}_{-0.10}$ (SHoES) and $D = 3.98^{+0.07}_{-0.09}$ (Planck). Furthermore, we place limits on the screening scale for theories with $D>4$ spacetime dimensions, finding that the screening scale must be greater than $\sim 20$ Mpc. We also place a lower limit on the lifetime of the graviton of $t > 4.50 \times 10^8$ yr.","Wed, 24 Jan 2018 19:38:42 UTC (490 KB)[v2] Sat, 14 Jul 2018 00:37:28 UTC (561 KB)[v3] Tue, 17 Jul 2018 14:02:16 UTC (561 KB)"

However, learning ""compatibility"" is challenging due to (1) broader notions of compatibility than those of similarity, (2) the asymmetric nature of compatibility, and (3) only a small set of compatible and incompatible items are observed. We propose an end-to-end trainable system to embed each item into a latent vector and project a query item into K compatible prototypes in the same space. These prototypes reflect the broad notions of compatibility. We refer to both the embedding and prototypes as ""Compatibility Family"". In our learned space, we introduce a novel Projected Compatibility Distance (PCD) function which is differentiable and ensures diversity by aiming for at least one prototype to be close to a compatible item, whereas none of the prototypes are close to an incompatible item. We evaluate our system on a toy dataset, two Amazon product datasets, and Polyvore outfit dataset. Our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we show that we can visualize the candidate compatible prototypes using a Metric-regularized Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (MrCGAN), where the input is a projected prototype and the output is a generated image of a compatible item. We ask human evaluators to judge the relative compatibility between our generated images and images generated by CGANs conditioned directly on query items. Our generated images are significantly preferred, with roughly twice the number of votes as others.","Sat, 2 Dec 2017 04:22:56 UTC (2,588 KB)"

The need for an interpretable model is contingent on (1) the lack of ground truth training data, (2) the need to utilise prior information about the underlying latent space and (3) the ability to understand the quality of predictions on new, unseen data. To this end, we develop the MaxMachine, a probabilistic latent variable model that learns distributed binary representations, associated to sets of features that are likely to co-occur in the data. Layers of MaxMachines can be stacked such that higher layers encode more abstract information. Any set of variables can be clamped to encode prior information. We develop fast sampling based posterior inference. Preliminary results show that the model improves over the baseline in 17 out of 19 product groups and provides qualitatively reasonable predictions.","Thu, 30 Nov 2017 23:36:20 UTC (108 KB)[v2] Mon, 4 Dec 2017 09:14:20 UTC (108 KB)"

The attacker will train an own substitute model that mimics the model to be attacked. The substitute can then be used to design attacks against the original model, for example by means of adversarial samples. We put ourselves in the shoes of the defender and present a method that can successfully avoid model theft by mounting a counter-attack. Specifically, to any incoming query, we slightly perturb our output label distribution in a way that makes substitute training infeasible. We demonstrate that the perturbation does not affect the ordinary use of our model, but results in an effective defense against attacks based on model theft.","Wed, 15 Nov 2017 09:39:07 UTC (531 KB)"

FNT resembles feedforward neural network, which creates a tree-like structure by using genetic programming. To improve accuracy, FNT parameters were optimized by using differential evolution algorithm. The performance of the FNT-based CI model was evaluated and compared with other CI techniques: multilayer perceptron, Gaussian process regression, and reduced error pruning tree. The accuracy of the CI model was evaluated experimentally using die filling as a case study. The die filling experiments were performed using a model shoe system and three different grades of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) powders (MCC PH 101, MCC PH 102, and MCC DG). The feed powders were roll-compacted and milled into granules. The granules were then sieved into samples of various size classes. The mass of granules deposited into the die at different shoe speeds was measured. From these experiments, a dataset consisting true density, mean diameter (d50), granule size, and shoe speed as the inputs and the deposited mass as the output was generated. Cross-validation (CV) methods such as 10FCV and 5x2FCV were applied to develop and to validate the predictive models. It was found that the FNT-based CI model (for both CV methods) performed much better than other CI models. Additionally, it was observed that process variables such as the granule size and the shoe speed had a higher impact on the predictability than that of the powder property such as d50. Furthermore, validation of model prediction with experimental data showed that the die filling behavior of coarse granules could be better predicted than that of fine granules.","Tue, 16 May 2017 08:50:24 UTC (3,187 KB)"

Current state-of-the-art deep generative models designed for such conditional image synthesis lack two important things: (1) they are unable to generate a large set of diverse outputs, due to the mode collapse problem. (2) they are not interpretable, making it difficult to control the synthesized output. We demonstrate that NN approaches potentially address such limitations, but suffer in accuracy on small datasets. We design a simple pipeline that combines the best of both worlds: the first stage uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to maps the input to a (overly-smoothed) image, and the second stage uses a pixel-wise nearest neighbor method to map the smoothed output to multiple high-quality, high-frequency outputs in a controllable manner.

The external mechanical work, the recovery of mechanical energy of the CoM during and within the step cycles, and the phase shift between potential and kinetic energy curves of the CoM were computed. Our findings support the idea that unstable rocker-bottom footwear could serve as a speed-dependent noise- based training gear to exercise CoM motion during walking.

A probabilistic high- to low-dimensional regression framework is used to learn a mapping from these features to the acoustic properties. Results indicate that this mapping successfully estimates the azimuth and elevation of new sources, but also their range and even the walls' absorption coefficients solely based on binaural signals.

At every step, the foot experiences ground reaction forces necessary to support the motion of the body. With the advancements in shoe technology, running shoes have grown in popularity among runners, as well as non-runners, because they reduce the risk of injuries from the impact felt by the foot. The purpose of this report is to analyze the effect of running shoes on impact forces on the foot. This is achieved through the use of three force pads fixed at different locations on the foot The force measured by each sensor is then used to estimate the vertical ground reaction force, using the sensors' calibrations equations . Based on the ground reaction force, the effective mass corresponding to the momentum change occurring during the transient phase of the impact is estimated. The results show that running at 9 miles per hour without running shoes generates an effective mass of (14.9 +/- 4.8)% of the total body mass, while running at the same speed with running shoes generates an effective mass of (7.8 +/- 1.5 )% of the total body mass. The values highlight a significant reduction in the risk of pain or injuries accomplished by wearing running shoes","Wed, 7 Sep 2016 03:14:38 UTC (2,185 KB)"
